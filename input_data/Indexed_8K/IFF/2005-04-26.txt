Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached and being furnished hereby as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. ("IFF" or "the Company") dated April 27, 2005 reporting IFF's financial results for the first quarter of 2005. The discussion of the Company's historical results and its commentary regarding expected future results include and, where indicated, exclude the impact of sales and operating results attributable to certain non-core businesses disposed of in 2004, the impact of certain restructuring and other charges recorded in 2004, as well as the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing its historical and expected future results and financial condition, the Company believes it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparative basis, the impact of sales and operating results attributable to the businesses disposed of, the relative impact of the restructuring and other charges, as well as ongoing exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company believes that this additional non-GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of the Company's core business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to its core continuing business.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description ---------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., dated April 27, 2005.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- IFF REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS --------------------------------- UPDATES 2005 GUIDANCE --------------------- New York, N.Y., April 27, 2005... International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE: IFF) ("IFF" or "the Company") reported earnings per share for the first quarter 2005 of $.55 compared to $.59 for the prior year quarter. The 2004 first quarter results included the sales and operating results of the European fruit preparations business disposed of in 2004; excluding such results, 2004 first quarter earnings per share would have been $.57. First Quarter 2005 - ------------------ First quarter 2005 sales totaled $523 million, declining 2% in comparison to the prior year quarter. Reported sales for the 2005 quarter benefited from the strengthening of various currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; had exchange rates remained constant, sales for the quarter would have decreased 4% in comparison to the prior year quarter. Fragrance sales increased 4% while flavor sales decreased 9%; on a local currency basis, fragrance sales grew 1% while flavor sales declined 11%. Flavor sales in the 2005 quarter were impacted by the disposition, in the second half of 2004, of the Company's European fruit preparations business. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding sales attributable to the European fruit business from the 2004 quarterly results, 2005 flavor sales would have increased 1% in dollars and declined 1% in local currency. On the same as - adjusted basis, consolidated sales would have increased 2% in reported dollars and been flat in local currency. Flavor sales, most notably in North America and Europe, were also unfavorably impacted by lower selling prices for naturals, mainly vanilla. "During the quarter, we achieved a number of new wins and continued to see strong sales trends in many of the markets we have targeted for growth. However we, like others in our industry, continue to face challenges brought on by increased raw material costs and resistance to price increases. By remaining focused on innovation, superior service, and operating discipline, I am confident that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and drive market share gains to create value for our shareholders," said Richard A. Goldstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IFF. Fragrance sales were led by fine fragrance which increased 12% in dollars and 9% in local currency; the fine fragrance performance reflected the benefit of a number of new product wins. Chemical sales increased 3% in dollars and 1% in local currency while sales of functional fragrance products declined 1% in dollars and 3% in local currency. Sales performance by region for the 2005 quarter compared to the prior year quarter follows: - - North America flavor and fragrance sales declined 7% and 3%, respectively; in total, regional sales declined 5%. Aroma chemical sales increased 8%, while fine and functional fragrance sales declined 5% and 7%, respectively. Flavor sales had a difficult comparative with the first quarter of 2004 when sales grew 18%. - - European fragrance sales increased 8% while flavor sales declined 22%; in total, regional sales declined 5%. Reported sales benefited from the
strength of the Euro and Pound Sterling; local currency sales declined 10%. Local currency fragrance sales increased 3%; fine fragrance sales increased 17%, driven mainly by new wins, offset by respective decreases of 6% and 4% in functional fragrances and aroma chemicals. Local currency flavor sales declined 26%, mainly as a result of the disposition of the Company's European fruit preparations business. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding sales attributable to the European fruit business from the 2004 results, 2005 flavor sales would have increased 4% in dollars and been flat in local currency. - - Local currency sales in Asia Pacific increased 2% in both flavors and fragrances, resulting in a 4% increase in reported dollar sales. Local currency fragrance sales increased 2% led by a 4% increase in fine fragrances and a 12% increase in aroma chemicals; functional fragrance sales declined 3%. Local currency flavor sales increased 2%, resulting in a 5% increase in reported dollars. For the region, the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia were strongest, with respective local currency flavor sales increases of 9%, 32% and 27%. This strong growth was partially offset by weakness in Japan, South Korea and Australia which declined 5%, 22% and 9%, respectively. - - Latin American sales increased 5% with fragrance and flavor sales increasing 5% and 6%, respectively. For the region, sales growth was strongest in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico which grew 14%, 7% and 6%, respectively. Fragrance sales were strongest in Argentina, Brazil and Central America, with respective increases of 16%, 7% and 18%. Fragrance sales growth was led by a 12% increase in fine fragrance sales and a 4% increase in functional fragrances; aroma chemical sales declined 7%. Flavor sales were led by 36%, 11% and 8% increases in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, respectively. - - India sales increased 13% in local currency and 14% in reported dollars. Local currency fragrance sales increased 10% resulting in a 12% increase in dollars. Flavor sales increased 17% in both local currency and dollars. In both flavors and fragrances, the sales performance reflected the benefit of new product introductions. Net income for the quarter decreased 7% in comparison to the prior year quarter. The decline in net income was partially due to the disposition of the European fruit business; 2004 results included income approximating $2.2 million attributable to this business. Proceeds from the disposition were used to reduce debt but profits related to the Fruit business were not replaced by interest expense savings. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 41.0% compared to 42.7% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin performance was mainly attributable to increased raw material costs and customer resitance to price increases, as well as declining selling prices for naturals, most notably vanilla. Gross margin was also impacted by lower expense absorbtion attributable to the facility closure in Dijon and the transfer of related production to other manufacturing locations; production at the Dijon facility ceased in March. Research and Development ("R&D") expenses totaled 8.6% of sales compared to 8.3% in the prior year quarter, consistent with the Company's intended level of R&D spending. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 16.2% from 16.8%. SG&A expenses include $2.5 million of equity compensation expense for which there was no comparable expense included in the 2004 first quarter results. However, this added expense was offset mainly by lower accruals under the Company's various incentive plans than in the prior year quarter. Interest expense declined 14% from the prior year quarter due to lower average borrowings in the 2005 quarter compared to the prior year quarter; the average rate on borrowings for the 2005 quarter was 3.2% compared to 3.0% for the 2004 quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%, compared to 31.5% in the 2004 quarter.
Outlook for 2005 updated - ------------------------ Consistent with previous guidance, IFF expects 2005 local currency sales to increase in the low-single digits in comparison to 2004 sales as reported; based on current exchange rates, such local currency growth is expected to result in a low to mid-single digit increase in reported dollars. For purposes of this comparison, 2004 sales include $58 million of sales attributable to the European fruit preparations business. Excluding fruit sales from the 2004 comparative, IFF expects 2005 local currency sales to increase in the low to mid-single digits in comparison to 2004; based on current exchange rates, this local currency growth is expected to result in a mid-single digit increase in reported dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of sales is expected to remain at approximately the same levels as reported for the first quarter 2005. Manufacturing expenses are expected to benefit from the elimination of duplicate costs related to the shutdown of the Dijon facility. However, margins are expected to remain under pressure due to anticipated increased supply chain costs as well as expected delays in fully implementing price increases. Research and development expenses are expected to approximate 9% of sales, consistent with the Company's intended level of R&D spending. R&D spending will increase somewhat as a percentage of sales in comparison to 2004, mainly as a result of the elimination of the fruit preparations business; relative to other parts of the business, fruit preparations required less R&D as a percentage of sales. In 2005, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, are expected to increase somewhat from 2004 levels, mainly from inclusion of an expected $12.0 - $14.0 million in equity compensation expense in 2005, compared to $5.0 million of such expense in 2004. In May 2004, the Company began using Restricted Stock Units ("RSU's"), rather than stock options, as an element of the Company's incentive compensation plans for all eligible U.S. - based employees and a majority of eligible overseas employees. Vesting of the RSU's for the Company's senior management is performance and time based; for the remainder of eligible employees, vesting is time based (generally over a three year period). The actual expense will depend upon the value of the Company's stock and the number of RSU's granted. Interest expense is expected to decline 10% - 12% from 2004. The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2005 to approximate 31.2%. This tax rate does not contemplate the effect, if any, that may arise as a result of repatriation from overseas subsidiaries as envisioned under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; the Company expects to determine the amounts and sources, if any, of foreign earnings to be repatriated in the second half of 2005. Primarily as a result of the anticipated supply chain cost increases and expected timing in implementing price increases, IFF now expects earnings per share for 2005 to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.35 compared to $2.05 reported in 2004. Excluding restructuring and other charges representing $.22 per share, 2004 results per share were $2.27.
