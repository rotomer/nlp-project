On July 12, 2006, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (the Company) completed the private placement of $375,000,000 of senior unsecured notes (the Notes) with certain investors and entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with respect to the Notes with such investors. The Notes were issued in four series: (i) $50,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.89% Series A Senior Notes due July 12, 2009, (ii) $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.96% Series B Senior Notes due July 12, 2011, (iii) $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.05% Series C Senior Notes due July 12, 2013 and (iv) $125,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.14% Series D Senior Notes due July 12, 2016. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually on the 12th day of January and July of each year commencing January 12, 2007. The Company will use the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to refinance certain existing debt and for general corporate purposes.
 
Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may at any time, with notice, prepay all or a portion equal to or greater than 10% of the Notes, for an amount equal to the principal, accrued interest and a make-whole prepayment premium as calculated under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Company may also prepay the Notes solely for the principal and accrued interest thereon in connection with certain asset sales.
 
Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company will maintain a consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.5:1 (as calculated under the Note Purchase Agreement), provided that such ratio may exceed 3.5:1 (but not 4:1) upon the payment of certain additional interest. In addition, the Company will not permit the aggregate amount of its subsidiaries debt to exceed $670,000,000 as calculated under the Note Purchase Agreement, with certain exceptions. The Company and its subsidiaries will not incur any liens, subject to certain permitted categories of liens and a general lien allowance of $120 million. The Company also makes certain affirmative covenants relating to (i) compliance with law, (ii) insurance coverage, (iii) maintenance of properties, (iv) payment of taxes and claims, (v) maintenance of corporate existence, (vi) pari passu ranking of the Notes and (vii) the books and records of the Company, and certain negative covenants relating to (i) asset sales, (ii) mergers and consolidations, (iii) transactions with affiliates, (iv) changes to the general nature of its business and (v) terrorism sanctions regulations.
 
The Notes were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act relating to transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.
 
 
 
 
 
The description set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the Note Purchase Agreement and the forms of the Note, which are incorporated herein by reference and are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.7 and 4.8, respectively.

The Company will authorize the issue and sale of the following Senior Notes:

Table of Contents
 
The Series A Notes, Series B Notes, Series C Notes and Series D Notes shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4, respectively, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the Purchasers and the Company. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references to a Schedule or an Exhibit are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.
 
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to each Purchaser, and each Purchaser will purchase from the Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes of the Series and in the principal amount specified opposite such Purchasers name in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof.

Table of Contents
 
 
Discounted Value
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on such Note is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield.
 
Reinvestment Yield
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% plus the yield to maturity calculated by using (i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M.

In either case, the yield will be determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly on a straight line basis between (1) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Average Life and (2) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.
