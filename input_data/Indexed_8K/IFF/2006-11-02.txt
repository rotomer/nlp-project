Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached and being furnished hereby as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF or the Company) dated November 2, 2006 reporting IFFs financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
Non-GAAP financial measures: To supplement the Companys financial results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company uses, and has included in the attached press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures as disclosed by the Company may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies. To ease the use and understanding of our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, the Company includes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure which excludes restructuring and other charges for preparing financial targets, internal budgets and operating plans, evaluating actual performance against targets and budget, assessing historical performance over reporting periods, assessing management performance and assessing operating performance against other companies. This information has also aided the Companys management and its Board of Directors in decision-making and allocation of resources. A material limitation of this financial measure is that some or all of such special charges represent actual cash outlays and that such measure does not reflect actual GAAP expense. Management compensates for such limitations by clarifying that this measure is only one operating metric used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation, and by providing the corresponding GAAP financial measure.
The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) in evaluating actual performance. Management believes that given the unique nature of this item, including this information without the impact of repatriation in the prior year period is more representative of the Companys operational performance and may assist investors in evaluating the Companys period to period financial results, in a manner consistent with how management has evaluated such performance.
The Company also discloses, and management internally monitors, the sales performance of international operations on a basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. Management uses this constant dollar measure because it believes that it enhances the assessment of the sales performance of its international operations and the comparability between reporting periods.
Also attached is a copy of the slides to be presented in the conference call and furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-k.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
IFF REPORTS HIGHER SALES AND IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS
RAISES FULL YEAR 2006 GUIDANCE
.... International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE: IFF) reported earnings per share for the third quarter of $.70, exceeding the First Call consensus expectation of $.58. The third quarter 2005 results as reported were $.72, which included a gain of $.24 per share relating to repatriation of funds from overseas affiliates. On a comparable basis, excluding this one-time repatriation benefit, the third quarter 2006 results per share represent a 46% gain over the 2005 quarter.
November 2, 2006
Third quarter 2006 sales totaled $539 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter; fragrance and flavor sales increased 12% and 6%, respectively. Reported sales for the 2006 quarter benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar during the quarter; at comparable exchange rates, sales would have increased 7% in comparison to the 2005 quarter.
Fragrance sales were led by a 24% increase in fine fragrance sales, with much of the growth driven by new product introductions. Sales of functional fragrances increased 5% from both increased volume and new product introductions while sales of fragrance ingredients increased 11% mainly from increased volume.
Flavor sales increased 6%, based on a combination of new product introductions and volume growth. Flavor compound sales increased in each region in both local currency and dollars.
The acceleration of growth in sales and earnings is very encouraging, said Robert M. Amen, IFF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We continue to perform very well in fine fragrances, with our major customers, and in key growth markets  notably Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. These strong performances have been enhanced by renewed growth and improved operating results in both North America and Western Europe. These results demonstrate the strategic initiatives undertaken in the past year are beginning to pay off. I am also very pleased to see the improvement in flavor sales.
The actions we announced in mid-October to organize into flavors and fragrance business units will sharpen our focus and improve accountability. I believe this will accelerate our growth and improve results. We are confident in our growth prospects and our ability to build shareholder value as demonstrated by the recent 14% increase in our dividend and $300 million share repurchase program.

Third Quarter 2006
Sales performance by region and product category compared to the prior year quarter follows:
Net income for the 2006 quarter totaled $64 million, a 7% decrease compared with the prior year quarter, as reported. The 2005 third quarter net income of $69 million included a tax benefit of $23 million on repatriation of dividends from overseas affiliates.
Outlook for 2006 increased
For the full year, the Company expects sales to increase by mid-single digit rates in both local currency and reported dollars, in comparison to 2005; previously, sales had been expected to increase at a lower rate.
2
Earnings per share for 2006 are now expected to be in the range of $2.36 to $2.44, compared to previous expectations of $2.20 to $2.28; the improvement comes primarily from expected higher sales for the year, and the benefit of actions taken to improve profitability.
