Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached and being furnished hereby as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF or the Company) dated January 30, 2007 reporting IFFs financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Non-GAAP financial measures: To supplement the Companys financial results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company uses, and has included in the attached press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures as disclosed by the Company may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies. To ease the use and understanding of our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, the Company includes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure which excludes (i) restructuring charges and (ii) one-time gains on asset dispositions. Management uses these financial measures in preparing financial targets, internal budgets and operating plans, evaluating actual performance against targets and budget, assessing historical performance over reporting periods, assessing management performance and assessing operating performance against other companies. This information also aids management and the Board of Directors in decision-making and allocation of resources. A material limitation of these financial measures is that some or all of such special charges include actual cash outlays and one-time gains include actual cash inflow and such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. Management compensates for such limitations by clarifying that these measures are only one operating metric used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation, and by providing the corresponding GAAP financial measure.
The Company also uses the non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the effect in 2005 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). Management believes that given the unique nature of this item, including this information without the impact of repatriation in the prior year period is more representative of the Companys operational performance and effective tax rate and may assist investors in evaluating the Companys period to period financial results, in a manner consistent with how management has evaluated such performance.
The Company also discloses, and management internally monitors, the sales performance of international operations on a basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. Management uses this constant dollar measure because it believes that it enhances the assessment of the sales performance of its international operations and the comparability between reporting periods.
Also attached is a copy of the slides to be presented in the conference call and furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 30, 2007  International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE: IFF) today reports results for the fourth quarter and full year 2006; results are summarized in the table below (dollars in millions except per share data):
New York, N.Y.,
"The strong fourth quarter performance tops off a very good 2006 for IFF," said Robert M. Amen, IFF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "It is very encouraging to see the fourth quarter growth in both flavors and fragrances, all driven by the excellent contribution of the people of IFF.   Our strategy is working and we have good momentum going into 2007."
Earnings per share were $.49 in the 2006 fourth quarter, versus $.16 in the prior year quarter, an increase of 206%. The 2006 results include restructuring charges of $.02 and a non-recurring gain on disposition of land, included in Other income, of $.06.  The 2005 fourth quarter results included a restructuring charge of $.17 per share.  On a comparable basis, excluding the restructuring charges from both periods and the 2006 land sale gain, fourth quarter 2006 earnings per share of $.45 represent a 36% gain over the 2005 quarter.
For the full year 2006, earnings per share were $2.44, compared to $2.04 in 2005, an increase of 20%.  The 2006 results include restructuring charges of $.02 and non-recurring gains on disposition of assets, included in Other income, of $.14; the 2005 results included restructuring charges of $.16 per share, offset by a $.26 benefit relating to the Company's repatriation of funds from overseas affiliates.  On a comparable basis, excluding these non-recurring items from both years, the 2006 per share results of $2.32 represent a 20% improvement over the full year 2005 of $1.94.
Fourth quarter 2006 sales totaled $514 million, up 11% from the prior year quarter; fragrance and flavor sales increased 13% and 7%, respectively.  Sales for the 2006 quarter benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar; at comparable exchange rates, sales would have increased 7% in comparison to the 2005 quarter.
Fragrance sales were led by an 18% increase in fine fragrance sales driven by both new product introductions and continued success of existing creations.  Sales of functional fragrances and fragrance ingredients increased 9% and 11%, respectively, with the increases coming from both increased volume and new product introductions.  
Flavor sales increased 7%, based on a combination of new wins and volume growth. Flavor compound sales increased in each region in both local currency and dollars.
Fourth Quarter 2006
Sales performance by region and product category compared to the prior year quarter follows:
Net income for the 2006 fourth quarter, including $1 million in after tax restructuring charges, totaled $44 million, a 192% increase compared with the prior year quarter.  The 2005 fourth quarter result of $15 million included restructuring charges of $16 million after tax.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, improved one half percentage point compared to the prior year quarter, mainly due to higher sales.  
Research and Development expenses totaled 9% of sales compared to 10% in the prior year quarter.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.6% in the current quarter compared to 18.6% in 2005.  The 2005 quarter included approximately $3 million of expense relating to a product contamination issue.
Other income (expense), net in the 2006 fourth quarter increased $4 million over the prior year quarter, mainly due to the gain on sale of land, partially offset by higher exchange losses.
The effective tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.4% in the prior year quarter.  
Full Year 2006
Sales performance by region and product category compared to the prior year follows:
Net income for 2006, including $2 million in after tax restructuring charges, totaled $223 million, a 15% increase compared with the prior year.  Full year 2005 results of $193 million included restructuring charges totaling $16 million after tax, as well as a tax benefit of $25 million relating to repatriation of funds from overseas affiliates.  
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, improved one percentage point compared to the prior year, mainly from higher sales, improved manufacturing expense absorption and favorable product mix.  
Research and Development expenses totaled 8.9% of sales compared to 9.0% in the prior year.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.8% compared to 17.0% in 2005. The 2005 figures included approximately $8 million of expense relating to a product contamination issue; 2006 results include the benefit of a $3 million insurance recovery related to this matter.
Other income (expense), net in 2006 increased $7 million over the prior year, mainly due to gains on sale of assets, partially offset by higher exchange losses.
The effective tax rate was 28.8% compared to a rate of 21.6% in the prior year.  The 2005 rate reflected the one-time $25 million tax benefit; excluding this benefit, the 2005 effective rate would have been 31.6%.
