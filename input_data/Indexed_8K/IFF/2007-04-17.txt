Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure Effective January 1, 2007, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (the "Company" or "IFF") was reorganized into two business segments that reflect its Flavor and Fragrance businesses. This reorganization allows IFF to sharpen its focus on these businesses to drive future profitable growth. Separate individuals in the newly created positions of Group Presidents will oversee these business segments and report directly to the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The Company's CEO evaluates the performance of each business segment based on segment profit. Flavor and Fragrance business segments will maintain a regional structure for sales, marketing and creative development. Certain research and development ("R&D") activities will also be maintained regionally with each business segment focused on its long term strategic objectives. The Company will continue to leverage operating and creative efficiencies achieved through a centralized support structure. Global marketing, supply chain management, corporate R&D, human resources, finance and legal will continue to report to the CEO. Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resource and other administrative expenses which were not allocable to the segments. In anticipation of earnings announcements for 2007, the following information is being furnished as a result of the reorganization of the geographic regions into two business segments, flavors and fragrances, under which the Company operates: 1. Unaudited as-adjusted quarterly segment information for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005. 2.
