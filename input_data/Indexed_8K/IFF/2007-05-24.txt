Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant Effective as of May 18, 2007, the Administrative Committee for the International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. ("IFF") Retirement Investment Fund Plan (the "Plan") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") and appointed in its place Smolin Lupin & Co., PA ("Smolin Lupin") to audit the Plan's financial statements. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and concurred with the Administrative Committee's decision, but was not required to, and therefore did not, specifically approve it. The reports of PwC for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. During the Plan's years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and through May 18, 2007, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports for such years. In addition, none of the reportable events described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred during the Plan's years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and through May 18, 2007. The Plan provided PwC with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached as Exhibit 16.1 is a copy of PwC's letter, dated May 24, 2007, stating whether or not it agrees with such statements, regarding their firm. Effective as of May 18, 2007, the Administrative Committee appointed Smolin Lupin as the Plan's new independent registered public accounting firm. During the Plan's two years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and through May 18, 2007, neither the Administrative Committee, who administers the Plan, nor anyone else on the Plan's behalf, consulted with Smolin Lupin regarding any of the matters set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and Item 304(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (c) Exhibits. The following exhibits are filed with this Report. Exhibit 16.1 Letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regarding change in Retirement Investment Fund Plan's independent registered public accounting firm.
