Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 14, 2007, International Flavors & Fragrances. Inc. ("IFF") entered into two agreements to purchase shares of its common stock from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) for an aggregate purchase price of $450 million pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. IFF is acquiring these shares as part of a $750 million share repurchase program approved by IFFs Board of Directors on July 24, 2007.
 
 
The number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR program will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of IFFs common stock during the term of the agreements. Purchases under one of the ASR agreements are subject to collar provisions that will establish minimum and maximum numbers of shares based on the volume-weighted average share price over an initial hedge period. ASR program purchases totaling $112.5 million will be effected under the collar agreement. The minimum and maximum numbers of shares that the registrant will repurchase pursuant to the collar agreement will not be known until conclusion of the hedge period, which is expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  The remaining $337.5 million of the ASR program will not be subject to collar provisions. The registrant expects all ASR program purchases to be completed by end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, although the completion date of share repurchases under the collared portion of the ASR program may be accelerated at the option of Morgan Stanley. The actual number of shares repurchased will be determined at the completion of the ASR program.
 
The agreements, each dated September 14, 2007, contain the principal terms and provisions governing the ASR program including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the amount of shares that will be delivered by Morgan Stanley to the registrant, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the specific circumstances under which Morgan Stanley is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, the specific circumstances under which the ASR program may be terminated early and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the registrant and Morgan Stanley to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines. The agreements are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking and other financial advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
The Company issued a press release concerning the ASR program on September 17, 2007, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Section 8(b) shall be read as requiring the Buyer to deliver cash in respect of the settlement of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
 
 
(c)  The provisions of Section 8(b) shall apply to any then-current Settlement Balance if (i) on any given day, Issuer cannot satisfy any of the conditions of Section 8(a) or (ii) for a period of at least ten (10) consecutive Exchange Business Days, MSCO has determined that it is inadvisable to effect sales of Registered Securities.
(d)  If Issuer elects to deliver Early Settlement Shares to satisfy its payment obligation of an Early Settlement Payment, then, if necessary, Issuer shall use its best efforts to cause the number of authorized but unissued Shares of Common Stock to be increased to an amount sufficient to permit Issuer to fulfill its obligations to satisfy its payment obligation of a Early Settlement Payment by delivering Early Settlement Shares.

(vi) On or prior to the Registered Share Delivery Date, the Issuer shall enter into an agreement (a ) with MSCO (or any affiliate of MSCO designated by MSCO) in connection with the public resale of the Registered Securities, substantially similar to underwriting agreements customary for underwritten offerings of equity securities, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MSCO (or such affiliate), which Transfer Agreement shall (without limitation of the foregoing):

Settlement Balance
(viii) At the end of each day upon which sales have been made, the Settlement Balance shall be (A) reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate proceeds received by MSCO upon settlement of the sale of such Share, and (B) increased by an amount (as reasonably determined by the Calculation Agent) equal to MSCOs funding cost with respect to the then-current Settlement Balance as of the close of business on such day.
(ix) If, on any date, the Settlement Balance has been reduced to zero but not all of the Early Settlement Shares have been sold, no additional Early Settlement Shares shall be sold and MSCO shall promptly deliver to the Issuer (A) any remaining Early Settlement Shares and (B) if the Settlement Balance has been reduced to an amount less than zero, an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of the then-current Settlement Balance.
(x) If, on any date, all of the Early Settlement Shares have been sold and the Settlement Balance has not been reduced to zero, the Issuer shall promptly deliver to MSCO an additional number of Shares (the ) equal to (A) the Settlement Balance as of such date divided by (B) the price per Share as reasonably determined by the Calculation Agent.  This clause (x) shall be applied successively until the Settlement Balance is reduced to zero.
Make-Whole Shares

(ii)  Seller and any potential purchaser of any such Shares from the Seller (or any affiliate of the Seller designated by the Seller) identified by Seller shall have been afforded a commercially reasonable opportunity to conduct a due diligence investigation with respect to Issuer customary in scope for private placements of equity securities (including, without limitation, the right to have made available to them for inspection all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and other information reasonably requested by them) and Buyer shall not disclose material non-public information in connection with such due diligence investigation; , if Seller is not reasonably satisfied with such due diligence investigation or no such investigation is afforded to Seller due to circumstances at Buyer that make such investigation impractical, then such dissatisfaction or the failure by Issuer to afford Seller with such opportunity to conduct a due diligence investigation shall not provide a basis for Seller to refuse to accept the Early Settlement Shares and Make-Whole Shares by means of a private placement; , for the avoidance of doubt, that Sellers dissatisfaction with the due diligence investigation or the failure by Issuer to afford Seller with such opportunity to conduct a due diligence investigation may be used as a factor by MSCO in determining the per share value of the Early Settlement Shares pursuant to Section 8(b)(v) below; and
 
provided, however

(iii)  an agreement (a ) shall have been entered into between Issuer and the Seller (or any affiliate of the Seller designated by the Seller) in connection with the private placement of such Shares by Issuer to the Seller (or any such affiliate) and the private resale of such Shares by the Seller (or any such affiliate), substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities, in form and substance commercially reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and the Issuer, which Private Placement Agreement shall include, without limitation, provisions substantially similar to those contained in such private placement purchase agreements relating to the indemnification of, and contribution in connection with the liability of, the Seller and its affiliates, and shall provide for the payment by Issuer of all fees and expenses in connection with such resale, including all reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for the Seller but not including any underwriter or broker discounts and commissions, and shall contain representations, warranties and agreements of Issuer and Seller reasonably necessary or advisable to establish and maintain the availability of an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for such resales.
Private Placement Agreement
(iv)  If Issuer elects to deliver Early Settlement Shares to satisfy its payment obligation of an Early Settlement Payment, neither Issuer nor Seller shall take or cause to be taken any action that would make unavailable either (i) the exemption set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale of any Early Settlement Shares or Make-Whole Shares by Issuer to the Seller or (ii) an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act reasonably acceptable to the Seller for resales of Early Settlement Shares and Make-Whole Shares by the Seller.
(v) On the date requested by MSCO, (A) Issuer shall deliver a number of Early Settlement Shares equal to the quotient of (I) the relevant Early Settlement Payment divided by (II) a per share value, determined by MSCO in a commercially reasonable manner and which may be based on indicative bids from institutional accredited investors (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act)) and (B) the provisions of Sections 8(a)(vii) (x) shall apply to the Early Settlement Shares delivered pursuant to this Section 8(b)(v).  For purposes of applying the foregoing, the Registered Share Delivery Date referred to in 8(a)(vii) shall be the date on which Issuer delivers the Early Settlement Shares.
(vi) For the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Section 8(b) shall be read as requiring the Buyer to deliver cash in respect of the settlement of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
(c)  The provisions of Section 8(b) shall apply to any then-current Settlement Balance if (i) on any given day, Issuer cannot satisfy any of the conditions of Section 8(a) or (ii) for a period of at least ten (10) consecutive Exchange Business Days, MSCO has determined that it is inadvisable to effect sales of Registered Securities.
 
 
 
 
(d)  If Issuer elects to deliver Early Settlement Shares to satisfy its payment obligation of an Early Settlement Payment, then, if necessary, Issuer shall use its best efforts to cause the number of authorized but unissued Shares of Common Stock to be increased to an amount sufficient to permit Issuer to fulfill its obligations to satisfy its payment obligation of an Early Settlement Payment by delivering Early Settlement Shares.
 
9.  Special Provisions for Merger Events.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Equity Definitions, to the extent that an Announcement Date for a potential Merger Transaction occurs during the term of this Transaction and such Announcement Date does not cause this Transaction to terminate in whole under the provisions of Extraordinary Event in paragraph 2 above:

Issuer understands that MSCO will use this information in calculating the trading volume for purposes of Rule 10b-18; and
