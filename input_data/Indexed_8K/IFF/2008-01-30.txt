Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached and being furnished hereby as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. ("IFF" or the "Company") dated January 30, 2008 reporting IFF's financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures: To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company uses, and has also included in the attached press release and as part of its web cast, certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures as disclosed by the Company may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies. To ease the use and understanding of our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, the Company includes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company discloses, and management internally monitors, the sales performance of international operations on a basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. Management uses this constant dollar measure because it believes that it enhances management's and our investors' assessment of the sales performance of the Company's international operations and comparability between reporting periods. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial operating measures in connection with the fourth quarter results which exclude, as applicable, (i) gain on dispositions of assets in each of the 2007 and 2006 periods, (ii) restructuring charge in the 2006 period, and (iii) benefit of a favorable tax ruling in the 2006 period, relating to years prior to 2006. In connection with the full year results, the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial operating measures which exclude (i) gains on disposition of assets in 2007 (ii) a 2007 curtailment charge resulting from changes made to the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, (iii) benefit of a favorable tax ruling in each of the 2007 and 2006 periods, (iv) Other income in 2006 that primarily consists of gains on asset disposals, (v) a 2006 insurance recovery relating to a product contamination issue and (vi) restructuring charges in 2006. Management uses these financial measures in preparing operating plans, evaluating actual performance, assessing historical performance over reporting periods, assessing management performance, and assessing operating performance against other companies. This information may also aid investors in further understanding and evaluating the Company's period to period operating performance and financial results. A material limitation of these financial measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts, an asset disposition gain and an insurance recovery include actual cash inflows; restructuring charges include in part actual cash outlays; and benefits from favorable tax rulings reflect actual accounting and cash benefit realized. Management compensates for these limitations by clarifying that these measures are only one operating metric used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation, and by providing the directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 1
The Company also uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes the benefit of the favorable tax ruling in the 2006 fourth quarter, and for each of the 2007 and 2006 full years excludes the benefit of the favorable tax ruling in each of the 2007 and 2006 periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the benefit of these favorable tax rulings because, given the unique nature of these benefits, including information without the impact of these tax benefits may be more representative of the Company's effective tax rate and may assist investors in evaluating the Company's period to period effective tax rate, in a manner consistent with how management evaluates this financial measure. A material limitation of this financial measure is that tax benefits reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized and do not reflect the actual GAAP amount. Management compensates for such limitation by clarifying that this measure is only one operating metric and is used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation, and by providing the directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company also uses a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the effect in 2005 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). Management believes that given the unique nature of this item, including this information without the impact of such repatriation, is more representative of the Company's operational performance and effective tax rate and may assist investors in evaluating the Company's period to period financial results, in a manner consistent with how management has evaluated such performance.

"I am pleased with our 2007 financial performance, which reflects strong top line and EPS growth," said Robert M. Amen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We met or exceeded each of our financial goals and delivered our second consecutive year of increased earnings. "Our full-year financial results demonstrate that our strategies are working. Specifically, we increased sales, grew market share and built a stronger organization. While we still have opportunities for improvement, our 2007 accomplishments provide a sound foundation for continued growth in sales and EPS in 2008 and beyond." Excluding non-recurring items, fourth quarter EPS ("Adjusted EPS") was $.53, up 18 percent over the comparable fourth quarter 2006 adjusted earnings per share. The 2007 fourth quarter results included a gain on the disposition of land of $.05; the 2006 results included restructuring charges of $.02, a gain on disposition of assets of $.06, and a one-time tax benefit of $.04 relating to years 2006 and earlier. On a comparable basis, excluding non-recurring items from both years, the 2007 Adjusted EPS of $2.66 represents a 15 percent improvement over the full year 2006 adjusted earnings per share of $2.32.

FOURTH QUARTER 2007 - ------------------- Sales were $553 million, up 8 percent from the prior year quarter; Flavor and Fragrance sales increased 16 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Sales for the 2007 quarter benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar; at comparable exchange rates, sales would have increased 2 percent in comparison to the 2006 quarter. Flavors Business Unit - --------------------- The significant increase in Flavor sales of 16 percent was driven primarily by new wins and increased volume in Europe the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Flavor compound sales increased in each region in both local currency and dollars. Fragrance Business Unit - ----------------------- Total Fragrance sales were driven by a 4 percent increase in Ingredient sales and a 3 percent increase in functional, offset by a decline in fine fragrance of 2 percent. Ingredient sales were strongest in Asia as a result of a strong demand for compounds and production shifting to this region. Sales in Fine and Beauty Care weakened in the fourth quarter; most notably in North America and Europe. Sales performance by region and product category follows: 2
Fourth Quarter 2007 Highlights - ------------------------------ o Net income was $47 million compared to $48 million in 2006. o Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 40.7 percent compared with 41.0 percent in the prior year quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower selling prices for Ingredients and some impact of higher material costs as well as lower fragrance volumes. o Research and Development expense, as a percentage of sales, was 9.7 percent, representing a 12 percent increase compared to 2006; the 2006 quarter was low by historical comparisons, at 9.3 percent of sales. o Selling and Administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, was 17.8 percent, in line with the 17.6 percent in the 2006 quarter. o Other income (expense), net in the 2007 fourth quarter increased $8 million over the prior year quarter, mainly due to the gain on sale of land as well as lower exchange losses. o Interest expense totaled $16 million, increasing 119 percent compared to the 2006 quarter, primarily due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with the Company's accelerated share repurchase activities. o The effective tax rate of 26.2 percent compared to 23.1 percent in 2006; excluding the one-time tax benefit, the effective tax rate in the 2006 quarter would have been 28.8 percent. The lower effective tax rate for the current quarter resulted from a greater percentage of consolidated pre-tax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. o Average number of diluted shares (in thousands) of 81,694 compared to 90,602 in the prior year quarter. FULL YEAR 2007 - -------------- Sales totaled $2,277 million, up 9 percent from 2006; flavor and fragrance sales increased 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. 2007 sales benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 5 percent over the prior year. Flavors Business Unit - --------------------- Flavors delivered strong sales performance across all regions--most notably in Latin America, Greater Asia and Europe--and in virtually all categories, particularly beverages and savory. Fragrance Business Unit - ----------------------- Total Fragrance sales for the year were driven by continued growth in Fine and Beauty Care of 8 percent and Ingredients of 9 percent. Foreign exchange accounted for 4 percent of the sales increase. 3

Average cost of debt was 4.5 percent for 2007 compared to 3.3 percent in 2006. o The effective tax rate of 24.8 percent compared to a rate of 27.7 percent in the prior year.
