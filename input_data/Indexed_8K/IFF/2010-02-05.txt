Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 1, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Committee) approved a one-year supplemental performance metric for the Companys 2008-2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan cycle.  The new supplemental metric is based on improvement in operating profit margin measured over the fiscal 2010 period as compared to 2009.  The Committee established this supplemental metric to provide increased focus on the significance of driving improvement in operating profit margin, which continues to be an important factor in increasing long-term shareholder value.  The Committee decided to add this one-year supplemental financial target as a means of providing further targeted incentive for our management team to deliver improved financial results under this metric, particularly in light of the global economic uncertainty which began in late 2008 and has continued through the current period.
