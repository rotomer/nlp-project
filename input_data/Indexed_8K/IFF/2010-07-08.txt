(the "Company") filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 (the "2009 Form 10-K"), the Company had received a manually signed consent (the "Consent") from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, pursuant to which PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP consented to the incorporation by reference of its Report dated February 25, 2010 relating to the Company's financial statements and financial statement schedule in the 2009 Form 10-K and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the Company in the Company's Registration Statements on Form S-3 and Form S-8 listed on the Consent.
The Company filed the Consent as Exhibit 23 to its 2009 Form 10-K although inadvertently omitted the conformed electronic signature of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In order to correct this inadvertent oversight, a copy of the Consent as originally filed, including the conformed electronic signature of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is attached as Exhibit 23 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
