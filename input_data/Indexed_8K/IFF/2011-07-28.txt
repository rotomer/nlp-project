International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. (the Company) is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K which was originally filed on May 6, 2011 (the Original Report) to update disclosures made under Item 5.07 regarding the frequency of future shareholder advisory (non-binding) votes on executive compensation. Except for the foregoing, this Amendment No. 1 does not amend the Original Report in any way and does not modify or update any other disclosures contained in the Original Report. This Amendment No. 1 supplements and does not supersede the Original Report. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Report.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the Companys 2011 annual meeting of shareholders held on May 3, 2011 (the Annual Meeting), shareholders voted on whether future shareholder advisory votes on our executive compensation programs as disclosed pursuant to the SECs disclosure rules (Say on Pay Proposals) should be submitted to shareholders every year, every two years or every three years. With respect to this proposal the Companys Board of Directors recommended that the shareholders vote, on an advisory basis, in favor of an annual frequency for Say on Pay Proposals. The majority of the votes were cast in favor of having Say on Pay Proposals submitted for shareholder vote annually. The results of the shareholder votes at the Annual Meeting were disclosed by the Company in the Original Report. On July 26, 2011, the Board of Directors approved an annual frequency for Say on Pay Proposals. Accordingly, the Company will submit Say on Pay Proposals for shareholder vote at each annual shareholder meeting until such time as a shareholder vote on the frequency of Say on Pay Proposals is next presented to shareholders.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
