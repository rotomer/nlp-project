INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY REPORTS RECORD FISCAL 2003 SECOND QUARTER AND SIX-MONTH RESULTS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE APRIL 22, 2003 (Reno, NV) International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported its operating results for the second quarter and six months ended March 29, 2003. For the second quarter, income from continuing operations increased 28% to $93.1 million and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 34% to $1.07 compared to the quarter ended March 30, 2002. For the current quarter, total revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 15% to $567.5 million, and operating income increased 22% to $166.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. For the second quarter of the previous year, revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates were $495.3 million, operating income totaled $136.7 million, and income from continuing operations was $72.6 million or $0.80 per diluted share. For the six months ended March 29, 2003, income from continuing operations increased 46% to $181.5 million and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 38% to $2.07 compared to the six months ended March 30, 2002. For the current six-month period, total revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 32% to $1.1 billion and operating income increased 38% to $322.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended March 30, 2002, revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates were $830.6 million, operating income totaled $234.5 million, and income from continuing operations was $124.4 million or $1.50 per diluted share.
Second quarter net income, including discontinued operations as discussed below, totaled $87.1 million or $1.00 per diluted share versus $73.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. For the six months just ended, net income totaled $178.7 million or $2.03 per diluted share compared to $125.7 million or $1.52 per diluted share in the prior year period. EBITDA (earnings from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) increased 14% and 35% to $203.8 million and $404.3 million for the current quarter and year-to-date periods, compared to $178.7 and $299.5 million in the same prior year periods. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $124.3 million for the six months just ended, compared to $245.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily resulted from increased receivables related to machine shipments late in the quarter, increased inventory balances due to anticipated gaming machine demand and increased income tax payments resulting from higher profits. Capital expenditures, including investment in gaming operations equipment, totaled $66.9 million and $34.0 million for the current and prior year-to-date periods.
During the current quarter, IGT completed an offering of 30-year zero-coupon senior convertible debentures. The total offering amounted to $969.8 million aggregate principal amount at maturity and resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to IGT of $575.0 million. Concurrent with the offering, IGT repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock for $137.3 million at an average price of approximately $77 per share. At the time of the offering, Moody's upgraded our debt rating to investment grade and S&P reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating. As of March 29, 2003, the remaining shares authorized under IGT's stock repurchase program, as amended, totaled approximately 10.0 million shares. As previously announced, IGT committed to sell the casino and slot route operations acquired in connection with the Anchor acquisition. In late February 2003, the company announced the closing of the slot route sale for total gross proceeds of approximately $60.5 million. On April 17th, we also received approval from the Colorado gaming authorities for the sale of our Colorado casino operations and expect to close by the end of April. During the current quarter, IGT also committed to sell its non-strategic pari-mutuel wagering business, United Tote, which was also purchased in connection with the Anchor acquisition. Our financial statements have been reclassified to present the casino, slot route and United Tote operations as discontinued operations and assets held for sale for all periods presented.
Based on our commitment to a plan to sell United Tote and preliminary offers of interest from prospective buyers in the current quarter, we recorded an estimated loss on the sale of discontinued operations of $6.7 million, net of tax. The current quarter and year-to-date periods included a total loss related to our discontinued operations, net of tax, of $6.0 million and $2.8 million, or $0.07 and $0.04 per diluted share. Prior year quarter and year-to-date periods reflected income from discontinued operations of $1.3 million, net of tax, or $0.01 and $0.02 per diluted share. IGT sold 34,800 machines worldwide during the current quarter compared to 29,500 machines in the prior year quarter. Product sales revenue for the quarter totaled $254.5 million, an increase of 23% from $206.3 million in the prior year period. Gross profit on product sales increased 38% for the quarter to $122.8 million versus $88.7 million in the prior year. Gross profit margins on product sales increased to 48% for the current quarter versus 43% in the prior year period. Margin improvements primarily resulted from greater domestic machine volumes and related operational efficiencies, as well as a greater share of revenues related to EZ Pay(TM) and systems. Domestically, IGT sold 19,800 machines in the current quarter compared to 16,300 machines in the same prior year period. Domestic replacement sales totaled a record 13,900 machines, an increase of 15% from 12,000 machines in the prior year quarter. The increase in total domestic unit sales resulted primarily from greater replacement demand in the Nevada and Midwestern riverboat markets, as well as the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan.
"Our EZ Pay(TM) technology continues to gain even broader acceptance with our customers and slot players alike," said IGT President G. Thomas Baker. "During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Station Casinos in which they will purchase up to 8,000 additional EZ Play(TM) gaming machines over the next three years for their existing casino locations, as well as the new Thunder Valley Casino in Northern California." International machine shipments for the quarter totaled 15,000 compared to 13,200 in the prior year period, due primarily to increased sales in the U.K. and Europe, offset by decreased sales in Australia. Our international businesses continue to be steady contributors to operating income and cash flows. IGT sold 64,500 machines worldwide during the first half of fiscal 2003 compared to 61,900 machines in the same prior year period. Year-to-date product sales revenue totaled $495.8 million, an increase of 22% from $405.9 million in the prior year. Gross profit on product sales increased 39% for the current six month period to $237.8 million versus $171.2 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins on product sales increased to 48% versus 42% for the same prior year period. The increase in profit margins was primarily due to domestic machine unit sales comprising approximately 61% of total machine unit sales versus 47% in the comparable prior year period, ongoing operational efficiencies, and a greater share of revenues related to EZ Pay(TM) systems.
Domestic machine shipments for the six months just ended totaled 39,100 machines, an increase from 28,800 in the comparable prior year period. Domestic replacement sales totaled a record 25,000 machines, an increase of 34% from 18,600 machines in the prior year period. The increase in domestic replacement sales resulted primarily from greater demand for IGT's EZ Pay(TM) ticket-in ticket-out technology in the Nevada, New Jersey and Midwestern markets. In addition, replacement sales for the year have been strong in the government-operated public gaming markets, namely the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan. International machine shipments for the first half of the year totaled 25,400 compared to 33,100 in the prior year period, due primarily to decreased machine sales in Japan and Australia, offset by increased machine sales in the U.K. and Europe. Revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from proprietary gaming operations totaled $274.4 million in the current quarter, an increase of 8% compared to $254.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Quarterly gross profit from proprietary gaming increased 6% to $147.0 million compared to $138.5 million in the prior year. The quarter-over-quarter increases resulted primarily from an increase in the installed base of recurring revenue machines, as well as an enhanced yield per machine due to strong game introductions and a favorable jurisdictional mix.
Year-to-date gaming operations revenue and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased to $522.6 million or 34% from $390.0 million in the same prior year period. Gross profit from proprietary gaming operations increased 23% to $279.1 million compared to $226.2 million in the prior year. The year-over-year improvements resulted primarily from the inclusion of the Anchor Joint Venture activities subsequent to the Anchor acquisition, an increase in the installed base of recurring revenue machines, and an increase in yield per machine resulting from strong game introductions and a favorable jurisdictional mix. IGT's installed base of recurring revenue machines, including machines placed in both casino and racino markets, ended the current quarter at 32,800, an increase of 900 from the same quarter last year and 300 from the immediately preceding quarter. Machines in casino markets ended the quarter at 28,800 machines, an increase of 500 from the same quarter last year and an increase of 300 from the immediately preceding quarter, primarily resulting from increased placements in the Native American and Nevada markets. Machines in racino markets ended the quarter at 4,000 machines, an increase of 400 from the prior year quarter and flat when compared to the immediately preceding quarter. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily related to increased placements in Delaware, where IGT now has approximately 60% of the installed base of video lottery gaming machines.
Significant game introductions for the year that have received favorable customer acceptance include such popular themes as I Love Lucy(R), The Beverly Hillbillies(TM), (IGT's first penny progressive video slot machine), and Family Feud(TM). New game themes expected to be introduced throughout the remainder of fiscal 2003 include HARLEY-DAVIDSON(R) S2000(R), UNO(R), Sale of the Century(TM) and M*A*S*H(TM). Revenues from lottery systems totaled $38.6 million in the current quarter, an increase of 11% from $34.7 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit increased 25% for the quarter to $13.5 million versus $10.8 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date, lottery systems revenues and gross profits totaled $75.6 million and $26.0 million. The current quarter and year-to-date revenues and gross profits benefited from commencement of our on-line lottery contract in South Korea, which went live in early December 2002. Operating expenses for the quarter and year-to-date periods totaled $116.5 million and $220.1 million compared to $101.3 million and $173.7 million in the comparable prior year periods. The current quarter included approximately $2.5 million in severance costs associated with the transition of the Bozeman, Montana manufacturing facility to Reno. In addition, due to the current restrictive regulatory environment in Australia, we recorded $900,000 in
severance costs in an effort to reduce staffing levels at our local subsidiary. Operating expenses increased due to additional incentive accruals related to our operating performance, increased legal costs related to intellectual property protection, increased costs associated with our company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation, and ongoing investment in research and development. Other expense, net, for the current quarter and year-to-date periods totaled $17.3 million and $31.5 million compared to $19.3 million and $34.9 million for the same periods in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at March 29, 2003 totaled $958.3 million, working capital totaled $1.3 billion, and total long-term debt was $1.5 billion. Cash and cash equivalents at September 28, 2002 totaled $421.4 million, working capital totaled $700.0 million and total long-term debt was $971.4 million. The increases are primarily related to the convertible debt offering previously mentioned.

EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of our operating performance) or cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same manner, and EBITDA as presented by IGT may not be comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies.
