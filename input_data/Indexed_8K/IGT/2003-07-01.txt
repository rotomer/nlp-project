BACKGROUND A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS"), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company, $.01 par value per share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below). B. The Merger requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the "STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). C. Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to each of Parent's and Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, Floyd W. Glisson, a stockholder of the Company (the "SELECTED STOCKHOLDER"), has entered into a Voting Agreement (the "VOTING AGREEMENT") with Parent dated as of the date of this Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, pursuant to which the Selected Stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote all voting securities of the Company beneficially owned by the Selected Stockholder or for which the Selected Stockholder exercises voting power pursuant to an irrevocable proxy in favor of approval and adoption of the Agreement and the Merger.

SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (the "CLOSING DATE"), at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, 275 Battery Street, 26th Floor, San Francisco, California, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

Each share of the capital stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto. (c) Conversion of Common Stock. (i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock (A) owned by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent or (B) held by stockholders ("DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS") duly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 92A.380 of the NRS ("DISSENTING SHARES" and, collectively with the shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent, (the "EXCLUDED SHARES") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, without interest, $11.50 in cash (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). (ii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the 3
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 or the right, if any, to require the Surviving Corporation to purchase such shares of Company Common Stock for their "fair value" as determined in accordance with Section 92A.380 of the NRS. The holders of such certificates previously evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time except as otherwise provided herein or by law. SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent (as defined below) shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (the "COMPANY LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company certificates representing shares of the Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with, or cause to be deposited with, the party specified by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock, amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Exchange Agent to make payments pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) hereof to holders of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who are to receive the Merger Consideration. Any interest, dividends, or other income earned on the investment of cash deposited by Parent with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2(b) shall be for the account of and payable to Parent. (c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates, together with the Company Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and, and only upon such surrender, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, and Parent shall promptly cause to be delivered to such holder a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. The Certificates surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) shall forthwith be cancelled. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, then upon receipt of an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed and a lost certificate indemnity, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have been converted. (d) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, as 4
determined by the Exchange Agent or Parent, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. One year following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent which have not been disbursed to holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent only as general creditors thereof with respect to cash payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, Merger Consideration may be paid or issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, shall be properly endorsed with signature guarantees or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. (f) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and have not been paid prior to surrender. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registrations of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. SECTION 2.3 No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash otherwise payable to such holder of shares of Company Common Stock or paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. SECTION 2.4 Dissenters' Rights. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to require the Company to purchase such stockholder's shares for their "fair value", as provided in Section 92A.380 of the NRS, the Company shall give Parent notice thereof and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the shares held by such stockholder shall 5
thereupon be entitled to be surrendered in exchange for cash as provided by Sections 2.1 and 2.2 hereof.

(b) Other Actions. The Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any of the representations and warranties of such party set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or (ii) any of such representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect. SECTION 4.2 No Inconsistent Activities. (a) In light of the consideration given by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement to, among other things, the transactions contemplated hereby, and in light of the Company's representations contained in Sections 3.1(j) and 3.1(v), the Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate, or encourage the submission of, any Takeover Proposal (as defined below), or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.2 shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking any non-appealable, final action ordered to be taken by the Company or its subsidiaries by any court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, another person in connection with an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal by such person, if and only to the extent that, in the case of clause (ii), (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such action would reasonably likely lead to a transaction that would provide greater value to the 24
holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and that the party making the proposal has demonstrated that the funds necessary for its proposal are reasonably likely to be available, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable law, and (iii) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, the Board of Directors receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance similar to the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 6, 2003 between the Company and Parent (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). For purposes of this Agreement, Seidler shall be considered a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation. (b) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing of any offers or proposals with respect to a Takeover Proposal (including the terms and conditions of such proposal, the identity of the person or entity making it and all other information reasonably requested by Parent), within 24 hours of the receipt thereof by an officer or director of the Company or any financial advisor to the Company, shall keep Parent informed of the status and material details of any such offer or proposal and answer Parent's questions with respect thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, "TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any proposal (whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the Company's stockholders generally) for a merger, consolidation, purchase of assets (other than a purchase of inventory in the ordinary course of business), tender offer or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, a substantial equity interest in, any voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets constitute more than 15% of the combined assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly release any third party from any confidentiality agreement relating to a Takeover Proposal. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from disclosing to its stockholders the statement required by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal by means of a tender offer or from making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be a violation of its obligations under applicable law. ARTICLE V ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS SECTION 5.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders' Meeting. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held to obtain the Stockholder Approval (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "PROXY STATEMENT"). In connection with the notice of the Company's stockholders meeting at which the Merger is to be approved by the Company's stockholders, the Company shall have complied with NRS Sections 92A.410, and thereafter, shall comply with all other applicable provisions of NRS Sections 92A.300 to 92A.500, 25
inclusive, regarding dissenters' rights under Nevada law. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Proxy Statement and shall respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and cause the Proxy Statement and form of proxy to be mailed to the Company's stockholders at the earliest practicable date. Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof furnish the Company with all information for inclusion in the Proxy Statement as the Company may reasonably request. The Company agrees, as to information with respect to the Company, its officers, directors, stockholders and subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement, and Parent agrees, as to information with respect to Parent and its officers, directors, stockholders and subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement, that such information, at the date the Proxy Statement is mailed and (as amended or supplemented) at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, will not be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. Parent and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements thereof prior to their being filed with the SEC. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC or any request by the SEC for an amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments from the SEC thereon and proposed responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by either of them for use in the Proxy Statement, if any, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable laws. (b) Parent agrees promptly to advise the Company if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as defined below) any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect and to provide the Company with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Parent will furnish the Company with such supplemental information as may be necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Parent and its subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law after the mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company. (c) The Company agrees promptly to advise Parent if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as defined below) any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect. (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall call and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Subject to the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, applicable law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Company shall use its best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies, and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the approval of stockholders required by 26
applicable law or otherwise to obtain the Stockholder Approval, and through its Board of Directors, shall recommend to its stockholders the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval. SECTION 5.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford Parent, and the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, (a) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent, (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, and (b) the Company shall permit Parent's officers and representatives to meet with the officers of the Company responsible for the financial statements, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures of the Company to discuss such matters as Parent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for Parent to satisfy its obligations under Sections 302 and 906 of SOX any rules and regulations relating thereto. Except as required by law, each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives and affiliates to hold, any confidential information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. SECTION 5.3 Reasonable Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the making of all necessary filings with the Specified Agencies under the HSR Act and the taking of such further commercially reasonable actions as may required to obtain termination or expiration of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act, (ii) the making of all necessary applications, registrations and filings (including all filings with Governmental Entities other than the Specified Agencies, if any), (iii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, licenses, consents, approvals or waivers from Governmental Entities and other third parties, (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and (v) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the using of all commercially reasonable efforts necessary to lift, rescind or mitigate the effect of any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not require Parent or Sub to take any actions in connection with any competition laws (including the HSR Act) pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) which would require Parent or Sub to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent, Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 27
(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iii) the occurrence of any change or event having, or which insofar as can reasonably be foreseen to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as the case may be; provided, however, that no such notification shall (A) affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or (B) limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. SECTION 5.4 Gaming Approvals. (a) Gaming Approvals. (i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, registrations, licenses, findings of suitability, qualifications, consents, waivers, variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities under Gaming Laws which are necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether required to be made or obtained prior to or after the Effective Time) (all of the foregoing, collectively "GAMING APPROVALS") and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Gaming Approvals. Each of the Company and Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause their respective officers, directors and affiliates to, file within thirty days after the date hereof, and in all events shall file within sixty days after the date hereof, all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining the Gaming Approvals and shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter in responding to additional requests in connection therewith. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with Gaming Approvals. The Company and Parent agree promptly to advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Gaming Approval required from such Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. (ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent to take any action which would require the voluntary surrender, forfeiture or other termination by Parent of a Gaming Approval then held by Parent or any of its subsidiaries. 28
(b) Denial of License; Individuals. If any person shall become an Ineligible Person prior to the Closing, then (i) the Company shall use its best efforts to cause each Ineligible Person to, immediately and permanently, resign from any position, including as director or officer, in the Company and each Ineligible Person shall have no further management role in the Company, (ii) if required to do so by any Governmental Entity as a condition to receipt of any Gaming Approval, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause each Ineligible Person to dispose of all of its securities or other ownership interests in the Company, and (iii) the Company shall use its best efforts to cause each Ineligible Person to, cooperate with the Company, Parent and Sub in their efforts to obtain and retain in full force and effect the Gaming Approval. "INELIGIBLE PERSON" shall mean any person who owns any capital stock or other interest in the Company (i) who is denied a Gaming Approval, disqualified from eligibility for a Gaming Approval or found unsuitable by any Governmental Entity before the Closing Date, (ii) whose continued involvement in the business of the Company as an employee, director, officer or otherwise, may, in Parent's reasonable opinion after consultation with counsel, have a Material Adverse Effect on the likelihood that any Governmental Entity will issue a Gaming Approval to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Sub or Parent or (iii) is expressly precluded from having any continuing interest in the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Sub or Parent in any Gaming Approval granted by a Governmental Entity as a condition to the issuance or continued validity of any Gaming Approval by any Governmental Entity. SECTION 5.5 Stock Options and Warrants. (a) Options. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Stock Option Plans (as defined below)) shall adopt such resolutions, obtain such consent, and take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of all outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("STOCK OPTIONS") heretofore granted under any stock option or stock appreciation rights plan, program or arrangement of the Company or under any stock option award agreement, including, without limitation, the Company's 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "STOCK OPTION PLANS") as is necessary to provide: (i) that the holder of each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, which is then exercisable or would, by the express terms of the applicable Stock Option Plan or the individual agreement evidencing such option, become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Merger (the "VESTED OPTIONS"), shall receive in settlement thereof, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration minus the per share exercise or purchase price of such Vested Option as of the date hereof; (ii) that the holder of each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, which is not then exercisable and would not, by the express terms of the applicable Stock Option Plan or the individual agreement evidencing such option, become exercisable upon the occurrence of the Merger (the "UNVESTED OPTIONS"), shall receive in settlement thereof, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Option, the conditional right, subject to the continued employment requirement described below in this Section 5.5(a), to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration minus the per share exercise or purchase price of such Unvested Option as of the date hereof; (iii) that, except as expressly provided below in this Section 5.5(a), no payment, pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(ii) or 29
otherwise, shall be made with respect to an Unvested Option if the person who holds such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time is not continuously employed by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of their subsidiaries (a "PARENT ENTITY") through each applicable date that such Unvested Option was otherwise scheduled to become exercisable had the Merger not occurred; and (iv) that, at the Effective Time, all outstanding Stock Options, including Vested Options and Unvested Options, shall immediately terminate, and there shall be substituted therefor the right to receive cash in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.5(a), and neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall have any further obligation with respect thereto other than as expressly provided in this Section 5.5(a); provided, however, that all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) shall be subject to any required tax withholding. Payment of the amount determined pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i) with respect to a Vested Option shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. Payment of the amount determined pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(ii) with respect to an Unvested Option shall be made (without interest) not more than thirty (30) days following each applicable date that such Unvested Option would have otherwise become exercisable assuming that the Merger had not occurred or, in the case of a Parent Termination (as defined below), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Parent Termination Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the employment of a holder of Unvested Options is terminated other than for Cause (as defined below) by the Surviving Corporation prior to the eighteenth month anniversary of the Effective Date and such holder is not employed by any other Parent Entity (a "PARENT TERMINATION" and the date of such termination being the "PARENT TERMINATION DATE")), then, for purposes of this Section 5.5(a), (i) if the option holder is subject to a Parent Termination on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Date, all of the Unvested Options of such holder shall be deemed vested as of the Parent Termination Date and (ii) if the option holder is subject to a Parent Termination after the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Date but on or prior to the eighteenth month anniversary of the Effective Date, all of the Unvested Options of such holder that would have vested on April 1, 2005 had the Merger not occurred shall be deemed vested as of the Parent Termination Date. For purposes of this Section 5.5(a), "CAUSE" means a determination by the applicable Parent Entity that the holder has been dishonest, committed an act of fraud or misconduct, engaged in an unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, been convicted of or confessed to committing a crime punishable by law (other than minor traffic violations) or has continued to fail or refuse to carry out the duties assigned to such holder, and such failure or refusal has continued for 30 days after written notice thereof to the holder. (b) Warrants. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall mail a notice concerning the transactions contemplated hereby to all holders of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("WARRANTS") as required pursuant to the terms of such holders' individual warrant agreements. In addition, between the date hereof and the Effective Time the Company shall comply with all other notice requirements of the Warrants. At 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding Warrants shall immediately terminate, and neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall have any further obligations with respect thereto. 30
SECTION 5.6 Takeover Statutes; Inconsistent Actions. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share," "business combination," "shareholder protection" or similar or other anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted under any state or Federal law shall become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are within its authority so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company has not and, during the term of this Agreement shall not, adopt, effect or implement any "shareholders' rights plan," "poison pill" or similar arrangement. SECTION 5.7 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) The articles of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by law. (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) on terms no less favorable to such indemnified parties than the terms of such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that (i) in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the Company, with Parent's written consent, may purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement ("reporting tail coverage") under its existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage and (ii) if the cost of such insurance in any year during such six-year period shall exceed 150% of the premium cost for such policy in effect during the year ended December 31, 2003 (the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"), then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, provide coverage affording the same protection as maintained by Parent as of such date for its officers and directors. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is $335,000. (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 5.7, for six years after the Effective Time, Parent hereby, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, guaranties for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time under its articles of incorporation and by-laws. Parent unconditionally and irrevocably waives any provision under applicable law that may limit the enforceability of such guaranty. The directors and officers of the Company shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7(c) and may seek to enforce Parent's obligations under this Section 5.7(c) in the event the Surviving Corporation fails to pay when due any indemnification obligations to such directors and officers. 31
(d) The obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in this Section 5.7 shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. SECTION 5.8 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses. SECTION 5.9 Public Announcements. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, including without limitation those press releases that may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. SECTION 5.10 Resignation of Directors. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to resign their positions as such as of the Effective Time. SECTION 5.11 Employee Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiary with all employee benefit plans as are provided by Parent and its subsidiaries to their own employees who are similarly situated. The foregoing shall not constitute any commitment, contract, understanding, undertaking, guarantee (express or implied) on the part of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to continue the employment of any employee of the Company for any period of time or on any terms except as determined by the Surviving Corporation. ARTICLE VI CONDITIONS PRECEDENT SECTION 6.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligations to Effect the Merger.
