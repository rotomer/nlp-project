 2003 IGT. All rights reserved.
          International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported its operating results for the third quarter and nine months ended June 28, 2003. During the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a four-for-one stock split for shareholders of record on June 18, 2003, with the subsequent share distribution on July 2, 2003. All current and prior period share amounts are reflective of this stock split.
(Reno, NV  July 17, 2003)
        Third quarter net income totaled $103.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share versus $82.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. For the nine months just ended, net income totaled $282.4 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to $208.3 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year period.
        For the third quarter, income from continuing operations increased 29% to $103.0 million, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 36% to $0.30 compared to the quarter ended June 29, 2002. Total quarterly revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates grew 16% to $597.5 million and operating income reached $178.6 million, up 23% when compared to the same period in the prior year. For the third quarter of the previous year, revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates were $515.8 million, operating income totaled $145.6 million, and income from continuing operations was $79.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share.
        For the nine months ended June 28, 2003, income from continuing operations improved 39% to $284.5 million, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 35% to $0.81 compared to the nine months ended June 29, 2002. Total year-to-date revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates grew 26% to $1.7 billion and operating income reached $501.4 million, up 32% when compared to the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended June 29, 2002, revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates were $1.3 billion, operating income totaled $380.1 million, and income from continuing operations was $204.3 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
        "We are extremely pleased with the June quarter and nine-month results as they underscore our emphasis on the development and delivery of the best possible products to our customers across all of the markets we serve," commented IGT Chief Executive Officer G. Thomas Baker. "The diversity of our business yields a consistency of cash flows and earnings, which allows us to maintain an important goal of a strong balance sheet. These factors were clearly influential in driving our recent dividend announcement, as well as the recent upgrade of our debt to BBB by Standard and Poor's."
        As previously announced on June 4, 2003, our Board of Directors also declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per share that will be paid on July 28, 2003 to shareholders of record on July 14, 2003.
        During the quarter, we also announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with Acres Gaming (Acres) for approximately $130.0 million on a fully diluted basis. "This strategic acquisition reflects our long-term commitment to the systems business and strengthens our capacity to provide innovative and reliable system products to the gaming industry," added Baker. The merger is subject to approvals of Acres stockholders and various regulatory agencies, including Hart-Scott-Rodino, and gaming regulators. We anticipate the transaction will be completed by the end of calendar 2003.
        During the current quarter, we closed the sale of the Colorado casino operations acquired with Anchor Gaming (Anchor) for total proceeds of $82.0 million, recognizing a net loss of $1.1 million. In addition, we expect to close the sale of United Tote (UT), our pari-mutuel wagering business also acquired with Anchor, during our fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. These operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations and assets held for sale for all periods presented.
        IGT sold 37,500 machines worldwide during the current quarter compared to 31,300 machines in the prior year quarter. Product sales revenue for the quarter totaled $300.1 million, an improvement of 35% from $222.4 million in the prior year period. Gross profit on product sales increased 52% for the quarter to $143.5 million versus $94.3 million in the prior year. Gross profit margins on product sales were 48% for the current quarter versus 42% in the prior year period. Margin improvements primarily resulted from greater domestic machine volumes, an increase in the number of spinning reel game sales, and a greater share of revenues related to systems.

        Domestically, IGT sold 24,200 machines in the current quarter compared to 17,600 machines in the same prior year period. Domestic replacement sales totaled 17,500 machines, an increase of 68% from 10,400 machines in the prior year quarter. The improvement in total domestic unit sales resulted primarily from greater replacement demand in the Nevada, Atlantic City and Midwestern riverboat markets, as well as the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan.
        International machine shipments for the quarter totaled 13,400 compared to 13,700 in the prior year period, due primarily to decreased sales in Australia and Japan, offset by greater sales in the United Kingdom. Our international businesses continue to be steady contributors to operating income and cash flows.
        IGT sold 102,000 machines worldwide during the first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared to 93,200 machines in the same prior year period. Year-to-date product sales revenue totaled $795.8 million, an improvement of 27% from $628.4 million in the prior year. Gross profit on product sales increased 44% for the current nine-month period to $381.3 million versus $265.5 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins on product sales totaled 48% versus 42% for the same prior year period. The improvement in profit margins was primarily due to domestic machine unit sales comprising approximately 62% of the total versus 50% in the comparable prior year period, an increase in the number of spinning reel game sales, and a greater share of revenues related to systems.
EZ Pay
        Domestic machine shipments for the nine months just ended totaled 63,200 machines, an improvement from 46,400 in the comparable prior year period. Domestic replacement sales totaled a record 42,500 machines, an increase of 44% from 29,600 machines in the prior year period. The increase in domestic replacement sales resulted primarily from continued demand for IGT's  ticket-in ticket-out technology in the Nevada, Atlantic City and Native American markets. In addition, replacement sales for the year have been strong in the government-operated public gaming markets, particularly the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan.
EZ Pay
        International machine shipments for the first nine months of the year totaled 38,800 compared to 46,700 in the prior year period, due primarily to decreased machine sales in Japan and Australia, offset by increased machine sales in the United Kingdom and Europe.
        Revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from proprietary gaming operations totaled $261.7 million in the current quarter, a slight increase from $260.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Our third quarter wide area progressive play levels increased across the majority of our markets, offset by the Nevada market due to the record $39.7 million Megabucks jackpot that was hit in late March 2003. Quarterly gross profit from proprietary gaming decreased 4% to $135.4 million compared to $141.4 million in the prior year. Approximately half of the gross profit decline resulted from lower interest rates in the period, and the remainder was due to higher operating costs.
        Year-to-date gaming operations revenue and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased to $784.3 million or 21% from $650.8 million in the same prior year period. Gross profit from proprietary gaming operations increased 13% to $414.5 million compared to $367.6 million in the prior year. The year-over-year improvements resulted primarily from the inclusion of the Anchor Joint Venture activities subsequent to the Anchor acquisition, increased wide area progressive play levels, and an increase in the installed base of recurring revenue machines.
        IGT's installed base of recurring revenue machines, including machines placed in both casino and racino markets, ended the current quarter at 33,600, an increase of 1,900 from the same quarter last year and 800 from the immediately preceding quarter. Machines in casino markets ended the quarter at 29,100 machines, an improvement of 800 from the same quarter last year and an increase of 200 from the immediately preceding quarter. The year-over-year and sequential quarter increases resulted primarily from increased placements in the Native American markets and Atlantic City, offset by removals in the Nevada market. Machines in racino markets ended the quarter at 4,500 machines, up 1,200 machines from last year related to additional placements in Delaware and Rhode Island. The sequential increase of 600 machines in the quarter was due to additional Rhode Island placements.
        Recent game introductions that continue to receive favorable customer acceptance include such popular themes as Lucy, , and . Other newly released game themes expected to be rolled out throughout the remainder of fiscal 2003 include
I Love
The Beverly Hillbillies
Family Feud
UNO, M*A*S*H, Little Green Men Jr., Magic 8 Ball and Video Sinatra
.
        Revenues from lottery systems totaled $35.7 million in the current quarter, an increase of 10% from $32.6 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit increased 22% for the quarter to $12.3 million versus $10.1 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date, lottery systems revenues and gross profits totaled $111.3 million and $38.3 million. The current quarter and year-to-date revenues and gross profits benefited primarily from commencement of our on-line lottery contract in South Korea, which went live in early December 2002.
        Operating expenses for the quarter and year-to-date periods totaled $112.6 million and $332.7 million compared to $100.2 million and $273.9 million in the comparable prior year periods. Operating expenses increased due to additional employee-related costs, as well as ongoing investment in research and development, partially offset by recoveries of previously reserved Argentine receivables.
        Other expense, net, for the current quarter and year-to-date periods totaled $16.2 million and $47.8 million compared to $17.2 million and $52.1 million for the same periods in the prior year.
        Cash and cash equivalents at June 28, 2003 totaled $1.1 billion, working capital totaled $1.0 billion, and total long-term debt was $1.2 billion. Cash and cash equivalents at September 28, 2002 totaled $421.4 million, working capital totaled $699.6 million and total long-term debt was $971.4 million. The increases are primarily related to the previously announced issuance of convertible debentures during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. During the quarter, we also reclassified the $400.0 million principal portion of our 7.875% Senior Notes to current, as they will become due in May 2004.
        Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $242.7 million for the nine months just ended, compared to $398.4 million in the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily resulted from increased receivables related to greater product sales volumes, slightly higher inventory balances, increased income tax payments resulting from higher profits, and taxes paid on the sale of our casinos and slot route. Capital expenditures, including investment in gaming operations equipment, totaled $103.4 million and $65.9 million for the current and prior year-to-date periods.
