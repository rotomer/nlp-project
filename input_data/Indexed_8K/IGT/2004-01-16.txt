EXHIBIT 99.1
RENO, Nev., January 16, 2004  International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today announced that as of January 20, 2004, the market price condition for convertibility of its Zero-Coupon Convertible Debentures due January 29, 2033 ("Debentures") will have been satisfied with respect to the conversion period beginning on January 20, 2004 and ending on April 19, 2004. During such conversion period, holders will be able to convert their Debentures into shares of IGT's common stock at the rate of 21.1704 shares of IGT common stock for each Debenture ($1,000 principal amount at maturity).
During our second fiscal quarter and for all future periods that the Debentures are convertible, we will use the "if-converted" method for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share. As a result, during such periods, we will include an additional 20.5 million shares as outstanding in our calculation of diluted earnings per share. This calculation will also add back the related expected after-tax interest expense of $2.3 million to net income in the applicable quarter. If the market price condition is not satisfied for future conversion periods and no other conversion event has occurred, we will not apply the "if-converted" method in the related fiscal periods.
IGT also announced that it is redeeming all $400 million in principal amount outstanding of its 7.875% Senior Notes due May 2004 on February 17, 2004, at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.
