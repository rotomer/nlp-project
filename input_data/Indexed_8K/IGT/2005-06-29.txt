The purpose of the amendments, which do not require shareholder approval, was to provide greater clarity to certain provisions, update obsolete provisions and add flexibility where it is permitted under Nevada corporate law.
The provisions that were amended include the following:
The full text of the Third Restated Code of Bylaws is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by this reference.

     . The corporation's principal executive office shall be fixed and located at such place as the Board of Directors shall determine. The Board of Directors is granted full power and authority to change the principal executive office from one location to another.
Section 1.2.
Principal Office
     . Each fiscal year of the corporation shall end on the Saturday nearest to the 30th day of September and the following fiscal year shall begin on the following day. The fiscal year may be changed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 1.3.
Fiscal Year
     . The capital stock of the corporation may be issued for labor, services, personal property, real estate or leases thereof or for money from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Section 2.1.
Issuance of Shares
     . The consideration for the issuance of shares may be paid, in whole or in part, in money, in other property, as aforesaid, or in labor or services actually performed for the corporation. When payment of the consideration for which shares are to be issued shall have been received by the corporation, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. Future services shall not constitute payment or part payment for shares of the corporation. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board of Directors as to the value of the consideration received for shares shall be conclusive.

Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and by a registrar, then a facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents, the transfer agent or transfer clerk or the registrar of the corporation may be printed or lithographed upon the certificate in lieu of the actual signatures. If any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any certificate or certificates for stock cease to be an officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or other reason, before the certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, the certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed the certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon, had not ceased to be an officer or officers of the corporation.
     . Transfers of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made only on the books of the corporation by the registered holder thereof, or by such holder's attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary, or with a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed by the corporation, and upon surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon, provided in all cases that all necessary approvals of appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained. All licensing and investigatory fees associated with obtaining the necessary approvals of all appropriate regulatory agencies shall be borne by the transferee and not the corporation; except that in the event the transferee is an officer, director or employee of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation, the corporation shall pay such licensee and investigatory fees for the officer, director or employee.

Section 3.1.

A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (ii) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of the stockholder and (ii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business proposed by a stockholder shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2. The officer of the corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the annual meeting that such business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2, and if such officer should so determine, such officer shall so declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the registered holder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation, with postage on it prepaid. If delivered by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be given when delivered pursuant to the requirements of NRS 78.370(9), as amended from time to time.

Section 4.2.
Election
     . Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.

     . A majority of the Board of Directors of the corporation then in office, at a meeting duly assembled, is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of directors holding a majority of the voting power of the directors, present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, is the act of the Board of Directors unless the act of a greater number is required by applicable law.
Section 4.7.
Quorum; Required Vote
     . Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, a written consent thereto is signed by all the members of the Board of Directors or of the committee, as the case may be.

Section 5.8.
Transfer of Authority
     . It is the policy and intention of the corporation to provide to its officers and directors broad and comprehensive indemnification from liability to the full extent permitted by law, as amended from time to time.
Section 6.1
Policy
     . Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action or inaction in an official capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of Nevada, as the same exist or may hereafter be amended, against all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in paragraph (c) hereof, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if Nevada law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all
Section 6.2
Right to Indemnification
 
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this article or otherwise. The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.
     . If a claim under this article is not paid in full by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct which makes it permissible under Nevada law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has failed to meet such standard of conduct.
Section 6.3
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
     . The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders, or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 6.4
Non Exclusivity of Rights
     . The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under Nevada law.
Section 6.5
Insurance
     . To the extent that any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation is by reason of such position, or a position with another entity at the request of the corporation, a witness in any action, suit or proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified against all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.
Section 6.6
Expenses as a Witness
     . The corporation may enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law.
Section 6.7
Indemnity Agreement
 
     . Any repeal or modification of this section shall not result in any liability for a director with respect to any action or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
Section 6.8
Effect of Repeal or Modification
     . All checks, drafts, notes, bonds, bills of exchange, and orders for the payment of money of the corporation; all deeds, mortgages, and other written contracts and agreements to which the corporation shall be a party; and all assignments or endorsements of stock certificates, registered bonds, or other securities owned by the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate. The Board of Directors may authorize the use of facsimile signatures of any of such persons. Any shares of stock issued by any other corporation and owned or controlled by the corporation may be voted at any stockholders' meeting of the other corporation by the President of the corporation, if he be present; or, in his absence, by the Secretary of the corporation and, in the event both the President and Secretary shall be absent, then by such person as the President of the corporation shall, by duly executed proxy, designate to represent the corporation at such stockholders' meeting.
Section 7.1
Negotiable Instruments, Deeds, and Contracts
     . The power to alter, amend or repeal this Code of Bylaws, or adopt a new Code of Bylaws, is vested in the Board of Directors, provided, that the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors holding office shall be necessary to effect any such action.
Section 8.1
Power of Directors
 
     I hereby certify that I am the duly elected and acting Secretary of International Game Technology, a Nevada corporation (the "Corporation"), and that the foregoing Bylaws, comprising 10 pages, constitute the Bylaws of the Corporation as duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on June 23, 2005.
