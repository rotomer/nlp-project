     On January 19, 2006, International Game Technology announced results for its most recent quarter ended December 31, 2005. The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
           International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2005.
(Reno, NV  January 19, 2006)
First quarter financial highlights:
          "While visibility to North America machine sales remains limited, we continue to effectively execute on our strategy to grow our international business, increase the installed base and efficiency of our gaming operations business, and expand the contribution from non-machine product sales," said IGT Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Year-over-year, our installed base of recurring revenue machines increased 6,300 units, with growth in both the North America and international markets. Product sales were strong in several international markets, and we grew our non-machine related revenues 46% over the prior year."
          For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, net income totaled $120.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share and included share-based compensation expense of $6.1 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share related to the required adoption of SFAS 123(R). For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, net income totaled $122.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share and included share-based compensation of $0.7 million, net of tax, recognized under APB 25, the previous accounting standard for share-based compensation.

Gaming Operations
          First quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $291.7 million and $165.5 million, respectively, compared to $286.9 million and $149.4 million in the prior year. In the first quarter, we increased the installed base of recurring revenue machines and experienced more favorable play levels in several markets. Gross profit margins for gaming operations increased five percentage points year-over-year due to effective cost management, positive shifts in interest rates, and a more favorable product mix in the installed base. The installed base included a greater mix of higher performing games and non-jackpot bearing games, such as multi-level progressives, central determination systems and lease operations.
          The installed base ended the quarter at a record 43,300 units, an increase of 6,300 units from the prior year and an increase of 4,500 units from the immediately preceding quarter.
          In the casino operations market, both year-over-year and sequential quarter growth were driven by additional placements in domestic markets that included California, Oklahoma, Washington, Florida and Alabama. Internationally, the casino operations market increased with the introduction of 300 wide-area progressive units in South Africa during the current quarter.
          In the lease operations market, growth was the result of the placement of 2,700 units in Mexico, with 2,200 of the units placed during the current quarter alone. In the preceding quarter, 500 units were placed in Mexico. Year-over-year and sequential quarter growth was also realized in the domestic lease operations market with incremental placements in New York and Rhode Island.

Product Sales
IGT Product Sales Summary
          First quarter worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits totaled $324.5 million and $166.5 million, respectively, compared to $354.3 million and $163.6 million in the prior year. Non-machine related revenues grew to $93.0 million in the quarter compared to $63.8 million in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales of gaming systems and game theme conversions. Consolidated gross margins in the current quarter were 51% versus 46% in the prior year, primarily due to a lower level of international sales and the growth of non-machine related sales that carry higher margins.
          North America machine sales revenue remained flat compared to the prior year due to the maturation of the ticket-in, ticket-out replacement cycle. North

America non-machine related revenues totaled $73.4 million, an increase of 46% from the prior year. North America gross profit margins totaled 54% and were consistent with the prior year.
          International product sales revenues totaled $117.8 million in the first quarter compared to $172.2 million in the prior year. The current quarter did not include any material unit sales in Japan, while the prior year included the sale of 29,600  units. Excluding Japan, our international division achieved strong results, most notably Australia, Europe, the UK and Latin America. International gross profit margins were 46% compared to 37% due to a greater portion of casino market sales versus low-payout sales.

Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
          In the current quarter, we adopted SFAS 123(R), , which requires the measurement and recognition of share-based compensation in the financial statements. IGT elected to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, IGT's consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal 2006 will not be restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R). Prior to fiscal 2006, we accounted for share-based awards under the APB 25 intrinsic value method, which resulted in the recognition of compensation expense for restricted stock awards and the modification or acquisition of outstanding unvested options. Please refer to the table on page 12 for further detail on how the expense associated with SFAS 123(R) is reflected in our statement of income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Share-Based Payment
          Total operating expenses were $146.2 million compared to $123.3 million in the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of $9.0 million of share-based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), increased legal and compliance related professional services, additional investments in game development and the inclusion of WagerWorks. Please refer to the table on page 12 for more information on the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

          Other income, net, totaled $2.7 million compared to $1.6 million in the prior year, mostly due to higher investment yields.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
          IGT generated $159.0 million in cash flow provided by operating activities on net income of $120.6 million. Working capital was $312.8 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $219.6 million at September 30, 2005.
          Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $726.3 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $688.1 million at September 30, 2005. Debt totaled $805.0 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $811.0 million at September 30, 2005.
          On November 4, 2005, as a result of an earlier change in New Jersey gaming regulations, IGT assumed direct responsibility for progressive jackpot system operations, including the funding of future winner payments, which was previously under the control of a separate trust administrator. The administration of past winner payments continues to be the responsibility of the existing New Jersey trust administrator, and IGT is relieved of any related obligations. As a result of this change, IGT is no longer required to consolidate approximately $139.2 million in assets and liabilities related to past winners, and these amounts are not reflected in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2005.
          Capital expenditures totaled $75.2 million compared to $44.4 million in the prior year. Consistent with the growth in our installed base, investments in gaming operations equipment drove higher capital expenditures year-over-year.
Capital Deployment
          On December 8, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on January 5, 2006 to shareholders of record on December 22, 2005.
          IGT repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $73.1 million during the first quarter. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 20.6 million shares at December 31, 2005.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, other expense, net, and discontinued operations) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Unaudited Supplemental Data (continued)
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
At the beginning of fiscal 2006, IGT adopted SFAS 123(R) (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of all share-based compensation, including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans, in the financial statements. The first quarter of fiscal 2005 does not include share-based compensation expense under FAS 123(R). Prior to fiscal 2006, we accounted for share-based awards under the APB 25 intrinsic value method, which resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock awards and for the modification or acquisition of outstanding unvested options.
