Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
     On April 20, 2006, International Game Technology announced results for its most recent quarter ended March 31, 2006. The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
           International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2006.
(Reno, NV  April 20, 2006)
Second quarter financial highlights:
          "We achieved a number of financial records in the second quarter, despite limited visibility into new unit growth in the domestic market. These accomplishments reflect our continued focus on growing our international business, increasing the installed base and efficiency of our game operations business and expanding the contribution from non-machine product sales," said IGT Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "During the quarter, we also achieved record EBITDA and returned a significant amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We installed our first communal gaming device, the , and it has been met with enthusiasm from both customers and players alike. We continue to invest heavily in new technologies for the future as our server-based gaming initiatives progress, and we believe that our recent agreement with Walker Digital will position us to deliver exciting new gaming experiences to the players."

          For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, net income totaled $124.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to $93.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the prior year. For the six months ended March 31, 2006, net income totaled $244.6 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $216.4 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the same prior year period.
 
Gaming Operations
          Second quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled a record $311.2 million and $183.9 million, respectively, compared to $298.9 million and $145.8 million in the prior year. Gross margins on gaming operations expanded to 59% compared to 49% in the prior year. Prior year results included asset obsolescence charges of $19.9 million, pre-tax, as demand transitioned toward our innovative new gaming operations products and cabinet styles. Margin improvement was also due to the expansion into new Central Determination and Class II markets, the success of our low-denomination and multi-level progressive games, decreased jackpot-related expense, and positive shifts in interest rates.
          For the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $602.9 million and $349.4 million, respectively, compared to $585.8 million and $295.3 million in the prior year-to-date period.
          The installed base of recurring revenue machines ended the quarter at a record 44,400 units, an increase of 6,500 units from the prior year and an increase of 1,100 units from the immediately preceding quarter.
          In casino operations markets, year-over-year growth was driven by additional placements in domestic Central Determination and Class II markets including Oklahoma, California, Florida and Alabama. Internationally, casino operations market placements increased with the introduction of wide-area progressive units in South Africa during the current year.
          In lease operations markets, year-over-year growth was primarily the result of international placements in the emerging Mexico market. Incremental domestic placements were also realized in New York, Rhode Island and Delaware.
 
Product Sales
          Second quarter worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits totaled $333.2 million and $166.3 million, respectively, compared to $252.2 million and $128.0 million in the prior year. Non-machine related revenues were $88.5 million compared to $76.1 million in the prior year, up 16% due to increased sales of gaming systems and game theme conversions. Consolidated gross margins in the current quarter were 50% versus 51% in the prior year, primarily due to a greater mix of lower margin Japan sales.
          Worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits for the first half of fiscal 2006 totaled $657.7 million and $332.7 million, respectively, compared to $606.4 million and $291.5 million in the same prior year period.
 
          North America machine sales revenue for the second quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year despite lower volumes. North America non-machine related revenues totaled $70.8 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year. North America gross margins increased to 55% from 53% in the prior year. Revenue and margin growth was primarily the result of a more favorable product mix that included sales of our new TrimLine product and increased non-machine related revenues.
AVP
          International product sales revenues totaled $131.9 million in the second quarter compared to $68.3 million in the prior year. The prior year quarter did not include any material unit sales in Japan, while the current quarter included the sale of 11,700  units, IGT's first game developed under Japan's new, more restrictive Regulation 5 requirements. We realized broad-based international improvements quarter-over-quarter, most notably in Japan, the UK, Europe, Latin America and Australia. In the current year, the international gross margin declined to 42% as compared to 45% in the prior year, and was attributable to the greater mix of lower margin Japan sales.

Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
          Total operating expenses were $157.5 million for the quarter and $303.6 million for the six-month period ended March 31, 2006, compared to $127.6 million and $250.9 million, respectively. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of additional share-based compensation related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), increased legal and compliance fees, greater investment in game development and the addition of WagerWorks. Operating expenses included share-based compensation expense during the current quarter and fiscal year-to-date of $7.6 million and $16.6 million, respectively.
          Other income, net, increased $5.4 million for the quarter and $6.3 million year-to-date compared to the same prior year periods. Increases included higher interest on investments and receivables.
 
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
          Year-to-date, IGT generated $204.8 million in cash flow provided by operating activities on net income of $244.6 million. Working capital increased to $855.0 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $219.6 million at September 30, 2005, primarily due to the reclassification of $607.6 million of zero coupon convertible debentures to non-current with the expiration of the holders' right to cash redemption on January 29, 2006. The next redemption opportunity for debenture holders occurs on January 29, 2008.
          Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $597.8 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $688.1 million at September 30, 2005. Debt totaled $816.1 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $811.0 million at September 30, 2005.
          As disclosed in the previous quarter, on November 4, 2005, IGT deconsolidated approximately $139.2 million of assets and liabilities associated with past winner payments for the progressive jackpot systems in New Jersey and, as a result, these amounts are no longer reflected in our current balance sheet.
          Current year capital expenditures totaled $134.5 million compared to $105.1 million in the prior year, resulting from growth in our installed base.
Capital Deployment
          On April 4, 2006, we completed an exchange offer for approximately 99.5% of our outstanding Convertible Debentures due January 29, 2033. In the transaction, we exchanged the old debentures for new debentures with an equal principal amount at maturity and paid a cash exchange fee of $2.51 per debenture exchanged. The new debentures carry substantially similar terms, except for the addition of a net settlement feature that requires IGT to satisfy a conversion obligation in cash for the accreted principal amount and in common shares for any remaining conversion value, thereby reducing the associated share dilution.
          On March 7, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on April 4, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 21, 2006.
 
          IGT repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $100.0 million during the second quarter. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 17.8 million shares at March 31, 2006.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, other (income) expense, net, and discontinued operations) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
 
Unaudited Supplemental Data (continued)
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Free cash flow is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments, and repurchase stock. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
