Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On June 13, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of International Game Technology (the "Company") amended its Corporate Governance Guidelines ("Guidelines") to implement a new policy regarding director elections. The amendment to the Guidelines was implemented to enhance corporate governance procedures and to give stockholders more input into uncontested director elections. Under the amended Guidelines, if, in an uncontested election, more proxies are submitted with instructions to "withhold" authority to vote for a nominee than to vote "for" that nominee, the nominee, if he or she is already a director, will be required to tender his or her resignation promptly following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will then consider the tendered resignation and will make a recommendation to the remaining independent directors not required to tender their resignations in accordance with the Guidelines; provided that if there are fewer than three independent directors not required to tender their resignations, then the recommendation will be made to all the independent directors, with each independent director required to offer his or her resignation recusing him- or herself from the deliberations with respect to his or her offered resignation (such independent directors are referred to hereunder as "Qualified Independent Directors"). Any director required to tender his or her resignation will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's deliberations. The Qualified Independent Directors will act on the recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting when the election occurred.
     The Company will promptly disclose in a report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the action taken by the Qualified Independent Directors with respect to any such offered resignations. The actions taken may include (i) accepting the resignation; (ii) maintaining the director but addressing what the Qualified Independent Directors believe to be the underlying cause of the withheld votes; (iii) determining that the director will not be renominated in the future for election; or (iv) rejecting the resignation. In reaching their decision, the Qualified Independent Directors will consider all relevant factors including, without limitation, (i) the stated reasons why votes were withheld from such director; (ii) any alternatives for curing the underlying cause of the withheld votes; (iii) the tenure and qualifications of the director; (iv) the director's past and expected future contributions to the Company; (v) the Company's director criteria; (vi) the Guidelines; and (vii) the overall composition of the Board, including whether accepting the resignation would cause the Company to fail to meet any applicable Securities and Exchange Commission or New York Stock Exchange requirement.
     The amended Guidelines became effective immediately upon their adoption by the Board. The Company's amended Guidelines are available on the Company's Internet Web site at www.igt.com by clicking on the "Investor Relations" link and then clicking on the "Corporate Governance" link. A copy of the amended Guidelines is also available to any stockholder upon written request to International Game Technology, 9295 Prototype Drive, Reno, Nevada 89521, Attn: Investor Relations.
