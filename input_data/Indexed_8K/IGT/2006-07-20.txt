Exhibit 99.1
      International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2006.
(Reno, NV  July 20, 2006)
Third quarter financial highlights:
     "IGT delivered another quarter of solid results, with record revenues in our gaming operations business and improved product sales revenues despite flat machine shipments," said IGT Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "The ability to post meaningful financial improvements in a market with limited new or expansion opportunities is a testament to the diversity and depth of IGT's business and product offerings."
     For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, net income totaled $114.1 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $114.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior year. For the nine months ended June 30, 2006, net income totaled $358.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share compared to $331.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share in the same prior year period.
Gaming Operations
     Third quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations improved to $314.8 million and $183.6 million, respectively, compared to $305.1 million and $164.5 million in the prior year. For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2006, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $917.7 million and $533.0 million, respectively, compared to $890.9 million and $459.7 million in the prior year-to-date period.

     Third quarter gross margins on gaming operations grew to 58% compared to 54% in the prior year. Year-to-date gross margins were 58% versus 52% in the prior year. Margin improvement was primarily driven by the continued success of our low-denomination and multi-level progressive games, decreased jackpot expense, an increasing mix of central determination games, and positive shifts in interest rates. Prior year-to-date margins were also negatively impacted by asset obsolescence charges.
     The installed base of recurring revenue machines ended the quarter at a record 46,200 units, an increase of 7,700 units from the prior year and an increase of 1,800 units from the immediately preceding quarter. Lease operations growth year-over-year was primarily the result of placements in Mexico. Incremental growth in domestic lease operations was also realized in New York and Rhode Island. Year-over-year growth in the casino operations market was driven by additional placements in domestic central determination and Class II markets including California, Alabama and Florida, as well as the emerging Oklahoma Instant Bingo market. International casino market placements increased with the introduction of wide-area progressive units in South Africa during the current year.

Product Sales
     Third quarter worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits totaled $297.6 million and $148.9 million, respectively, compared to $274.5 million and $143.7 million in the prior year. Non-machine revenues of $88.5 million were comparable with the prior year and comprised 30% of total product sales revenues. Consolidated gross margins in the current quarter were 50% versus 52% in the prior year, primarily due to a slightly lower mix of non-machine sales.
     Worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2006 totaled $955.3 million and $481.6 million, respectively, compared to $880.9 million and $435.2 million in the same prior year period. Year-to-date non-machine revenues increased 18% to $270.0 million and comprised 28% of total product sales revenues. Non-machine revenue growth was driven primarily by higher gaming systems, parts and game theme conversion sales.

     North America machine sales for the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year on flat unit volumes as a result of a more favorable premium product sales mix that includes the new Trimline machine. North America non-machine revenues totaled $63.3 million, down 10% from the prior year mostly due to lower parts sales. North America gross margins were 53% compared to 55% in the prior year mainly due to the lower contribution from non-machine revenues.
AVP
     International product sales totaled $110.4 million in the third quarter compared to $91.9 million in the prior year, up 20% despite lower unit volumes. International non-machine revenues increased 40% to $25.2 million mainly due to higher parts sales. Improvements over the prior year quarter were realized in Europe, the UK, Australia and Asia, mostly due to an improved premium product mix and a greater contribution from non-machine revenues. Current quarter international gross margin declined to 45% versus 48% in the prior year primarily as a result of higher shipping costs.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     Consolidated operating expenses totaled $160.9 million for the quarter and $464.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2006 compared to $140.8 million and $391.6 million in the prior year period, respectively. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of additional share-based compensation related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), increased legal and compliance fees, greater investment in systems and game development, and the addition of WagerWorks. Operating expenses included share-based compensation during the current quarter and nine months of $7.9 million and $24.5 million, respectively.
     Other income, net, decreased $9.6 million for the quarter and $3.0 million year-to-date. Other income in the prior year quarter included financing fees realized on early customer loan repayments totaling $10.2 million, pretax.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     Year-to-date, IGT generated $382.5 million in operating cash flows on net income of $358.8 million. Operating cash flows decreased from the prior year
 
International Game Technology Reports Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Results Page 5 of 12  
primarily due to increased receivables, additional prepayments to secure long-term licensing rights, the timing of income tax payments and the current year classification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans in financing cash flows as a result of SFAS 123R accounting changes. Current year capital expenditures totaled $216.7 million compared to $166.2 million in the prior year, resulting from growth in our installed base and the construction of our Las Vegas campus.
     Working capital increased to $950.7 million at June 30, 2006 compared to $219.6 million at September 30, 2005, primarily due to the reclassification of our zero coupon convertible debentures to non-current with the expiration of holders' rights to cash redemption on January 29, 2006. Because the market price condition for convertibility was satisfied with respect to the conversion period beginning July 18, 2006 through October 13, 2006, the debentures that include the net settlement feature will be classified in current liabilities for our fourth quarter.
     Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $579.0 million at June 30, 2006 compared to $688.1 million at September 30, 2005. Debt totaled $810.3 million at June 30, 2006 compared to $811.0 million at September 30, 2005.
     On November 4, 2005, IGT unconsolidated approximately $139.2 million of assets and liabilities associated with past winner payments for progressive jackpot systems in New Jersey, and these amounts are no longer reflected in our balance sheet.
Capital Deployment
     On June 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on July 11, 2006 to shareholders of record on June 27, 2006.
     The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 17.7 million shares at June 30, 2006. During the quarter, IGT prepaid $100.0 million in a structured share repurchase transaction designed to settle in cash or shares based on the closing stock price on June 29, 2006. Since the

closing price of IGT stock was above the threshold price of $35.50, we received cash of $101.1 million upon settlement in July, and no material shares were repurchased during our third quarter.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, other expense, net, and discontinued operations) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
