Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On September 29, 2006, International Game Technology (IGT) amended its existing employment agreement with Thomas J. Matthews, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Attached as Exhibit 10.1, the amendment provides for a new three-year term of employment expiring October 26, 2009, with automatic renewals for additional successive one-year periods unless at least 60 days advance notice of non-renewal is given by either party.
     The amendment provides an annual base salary of $800,000 and an annual bonus target of 250% of base salary beginning with fiscal year 2007. His annual bonus will be based in part on IGT profitability indicators, with the remaining portion based on a qualitative assessment of IGT financial performance and other strategic objectives as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In all other respects, the material terms of his existing employment agreement, dated October 27, 2003, remain unchanged.
     On September 29, 2006, the Compensation Committee also approved the issuance to Mr. Matthews of IGT common stock as follows:
     The restricted and performance shares include dividend rights prior to vesting and will vest on an accelerated basis if employment is terminated by IGT without cause or by Mr. Matthews with good reason following a change in control. If employment terminates due to his death or disability:

WHEREAS
Plan
Award
     , in consideration of services rendered and to be rendered by the Participant, and the mutual promises made herein and the mutual benefits to be derived therefrom, the parties agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE
     . Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Plan.

Restricted Stock
     . Subject to Section 8 below, the Award shall vest, and restrictions (other than those set forth in Section 6.4 of the Plan) shall lapse, with respect to twenty percent (20%) of the total number of shares of Restricted Stock on November 9, 2007, thirty percent (30%) of the total number of shares of Restricted Stock on November 14, 2008, and fifty percent (50%) of the total number of shares of Restricted Stock on November 13, 2009 (in each case, such number of shares being subject to adjustment under Section 6.2(a) of the Plan).

3. 
Vesting
     . The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 8 below or under the Plan.
4. 
Continuance of Employment
     Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation, affects the Participant's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain
 
employed by or in service to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his or her consent thereto.
     . After the Award Date, the Participant shall be entitled to cash dividends and voting rights with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock subject to the Award even though such shares are not vested, provided that such rights shall terminate immediately as to any shares of Restricted Stock that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8 below.
5. 
Dividend and Voting Rights
     . Prior to the time that they have become vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof or Section 6.2 of the Plan, neither the Restricted Stock, nor any interest therein, amount payable in respect thereof, or Restricted Property (as defined in Section 9 hereof) may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

Book Entry Form
          (b) . Any certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock that may be delivered to the Participant by the Corporation prior to vesting shall be redelivered to the Corporation to be held by the Corporation until the restrictions on such shares shall have lapsed and the shares shall thereby have become vested or the shares represented thereby have been forfeited hereunder. Such certificates shall bear the following legend and any other legends the Corporation may determine to be necessary or advisable to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations:
Certificates to be Held by Corporation; Legend

A copy of such Agreement is on file in the office of the Secretary of International Game Technology."
          (c) . Promptly after the vesting of any shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to Section 3 hereof or Section 6.2 of the Plan and the satisfaction of any and all related tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 10, the Corporation shall, as applicable, either remove the notations on any shares of Restricted Stock issued in book entry form which have vested or deliver to the Participant a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Restricted Stock which have vested (or, in either case, such lesser number of shares as may result after giving effect to Section 10). The
Delivery of Certificates Upon Vesting
 
Participant (or the Beneficiary or Personal Representative of the Participant in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as the case may be) shall deliver to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances as the Corporation or its counsel may determine to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations with respect to the grant of the Award and the delivery of shares of Common Stock in respect thereof. The shares so delivered shall no longer be restricted shares hereunder.
          (d) . Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Award Agreement, the Participant shall deliver to the Corporation an executed stock power in the form attached hereto as , in blank, with respect to such shares. The Corporation shall not deliver any share certificates in accordance with this Agreement unless and until the Corporation shall have received such stock power executed by the Participant. The Participant, by acceptance of the Award, shall be deemed to appoint, and does so appoint by execution of this Award Agreement, the Corporation and each of its authorized representatives as the Participant's attorney(s)-in-fact to effect any transfer of unvested forfeited shares (or shares otherwise reacquired by the Corporation hereunder) to the Corporation as may be required pursuant to the Plan or this Award Agreement and to execute such documents as the Corporation or such representatives deem necessary or advisable in connection with any such transfer.

If the Participant is employed by a Subsidiary and that entity ceases to be a Subsidiary, such event shall be deemed to be a termination of the employment of the Participant for purposes of this Award Agreement, unless the Participant otherwise continues to be employed by the Corporation or another of its Subsidiaries following such event. Upon the occurrence of any forfeiture of shares of Restricted Stock hereunder, such unvested, forfeited shares and related Restricted Property shall be automatically transferred to the Corporation as of the Severance Date, without any other action by the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary or personal representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable). No consideration shall be paid by the Corporation with respect to such transfer. The Corporation may exercise its powers under Section 7(d) hereof and take any other action necessary or advisable to evidence such transfer. The Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or Personal Representative in the event of the Participant's death or disability, as applicable) shall deliver any additional documents of transfer that the Corporation may request to confirm the transfer of such unvested, forfeited shares and related Restricted Property to the Corporation.

2. 
Grant
Performance Shares
     . Subject to Section 8(a) below, a portion of the total number of Performance Shares subject to the Award as determined under Section 3(a) (the "") shall be eligible to vest with respect to each of the five consecutive fiscal years of the Corporation commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 (each such fiscal year, a ""). The number of Performance Shares that vest for each Performance Year shall be determined by multiplying the number of Eligible Shares for such Performance Year by the Vesting Percentage for such Performance Year (as determined under Section 3(b)) and rounding to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the number of Performance Shares referred to in this Section 3 is subject to adjustment under Section 6.2(a) of the Plan.

Performance Year
     Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the vesting of any Eligible Shares for a Performance Year is subject to the condition that the Participant be employed by or providing services to the Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the second Friday of the November that follows the end of such Performance Year (or, if such date is not a business day, the next preceding business day).
          (a) . The number of Eligible Shares for a Performance Year shall equal:

          By way of example only, the following chart illustrates the number of Performance Shares that would be Eligible Shares for each Performance Year, assuming a 1,000-share grant and a Vesting Percentage for each such Performance Year of 80% (which assumes a 12% EPS CAGR multiplied by 6.67, as determined under Section 3(b)):

Accordingly, one hundred percent (100%) of the Performance Shares eligible to vest for the Performance Year ending September 30, 2011 that do not vest after application of the Vesting Percentage for such Performance Year shall be forfeited as of the second Friday of November 2011.
          (b) . The "" for any Performance Year shall be based on the Corporation's Earnings Per Share Compound Annual Growth Rate (as such term is defined below) ("EPS CAGR") as follows:

     . The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement.

Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his or her consent thereto.

After the Award Date, the Participant shall be entitled to cash dividends and voting rights with respect to the Performance Shares subject to the Award even though such shares are not vested, provided that such rights shall terminate immediately as to any Performance Shares that are forfeited pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8(a).
