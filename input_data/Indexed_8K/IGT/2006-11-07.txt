     "Strong fourth quarter results capped off a successful year for IGT, led by record revenue and gross profit in gaming operations and 16% year-over-year growth in non-machine sales," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Our margins expanded, Adjusted EBITDA reached a record of just under $1.0 billion, and we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchase and dividends in fiscal 2006. Our ability to thrive in spite of a sluggish year for new or expanding domestic markets is the result of our industry-leading product development, expansion in non-traditional and international markets, and the commitment of our 5,200 employees worldwide."
Gaming Operations
     Fourth quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations reached a record $333.8 million and $197.0 million, respectively, compared to $307.6 million and $154.3 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, record revenues and gross profit from gaming operations grew $52.9 million and $115.9 million, respectively, from the prior year.
     Fourth quarter gaming operations gross margins grew to 59% compared to 50% in the prior year. Margins in the prior year quarter were negatively impacted by asset obsolescence charges of $18.1 million. On an adjusted basis, current year margins improved primarily as a result of decreased jackpot expense and the continued success of our low-denomination and multi-level progressive games. Gross margins for the full year were 58% versus 51% in the prior year.
     The installed base of recurring revenue machines ended the quarter and the year at a record 49,600 units, an increase of 10,800 units from the prior year and 3,400 units from the immediately preceding quarter. Year-over-year growth was primarily the result of incremental lease operations placements in Mexico, New York and Delaware, and incremental casino operations placements in Oklahoma, California, Alabama and Florida. Sequential installed base growth occurred primarily in the lease operations markets of Mexico, Delaware and New York, and the casino operations markets of Oklahoma and California.

Product Sales
     Fourth quarter worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits totaled $304.9 million and $160.0 million, respectively, compared to $300.0 million and $141.4 million in the prior year. Record non-machine revenues of $93.5 million increased 11% from the prior year and comprised 31% of total product sales revenues. Consolidated gross margins in the current quarter were 52% versus 47% in the prior year, primarily due to a greater mix of non-machine sales and a lower mix of international machine sales.
     Worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 totaled $1.3 billion and $641.7 million, respectively, compared to $1.2 billion and $576.6 million in the prior year. Record non-machine revenues increased 16% to $363.5 million for the full year and comprised 29% of total product sales revenues. Non-machine revenue growth was driven primarily by higher gaming systems, parts and game theme conversion sales.
     North America product sales for the fourth quarter improved 30% compared to the prior year. Machine shipments increased 15% over the prior year primarily due to reconstruction efforts in the Gulf Coast region. North America non-machine revenues totaled $75.6 million, up 11% from the prior year quarter. North America

gross margins increased to 57% compared to 52% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to a stronger product mix.
     North America product sales revenue for the full year increased 13% on flat unit volumes. Non-machine revenues totaled $283.2 million, up 12% from the prior year. North America gross margins were 55% compared to 54% in the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by a more favorable mix of our TrimLine machines and increased non-machine revenues.
AVP
     Fourth quarter international product sales totaled $95.8 million compared to $139.7 million in the prior year. The prior year included the sale of 18,500 Regulation 4 units in Japan versus 1,900 Regulation 5 units in the current year. Lower volumes in Japan were the result of the current market transition from Regulation 4 games to more restrictive Regulation 5 games. Current quarter international gross margins were 42% compared to 41% in the prior year.
     International product sales revenue for the full year totaled $455.9 million compared to $472.0 million in the prior year. Lower shipments into Japan were partially offset by increased volumes in the UK, Australia, Asia and Latin America. International non-machine revenues increased 32% to $80.3 million. International gross margins improved to 44% over 42% in the prior year, mostly due to the lighter mix of lower margin Japan sales and a greater contribution from non-machine revenues.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     Operating expenses totaled $182.0 million for the quarter and $646.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 compared to $135.3 million and $527.0 million in the prior year periods, respectively. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of additional share-based compensation related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, increased legal and compliance fees, greater investment in systems and game development, and the addition of WagerWorks. Operating expenses included share-based compensation during the current quarter and fiscal year of $10.8 million and $35.3 million, respectively.

     Certain items affecting comparability in the current quarter included research and development charges of $11.3 million ($7.2 million after tax) related to the buyout of a third party development contract, a legal settlement gain included in other income of $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax), gain on the sale of our Rapid City, South Dakota facility totaling $2.1 million ($1.3 million after tax), and $2.0 million in unfavorable one-time adjustments to our tax provision.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     IGT generated $624.1 million in operating cash flow on net income of $473.6 million. Operating cash flow decreased 14% from the prior year primarily due to increased receivables, additional prepayments to secure long-term licensing rights, the timing of income tax payments and the current year classification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans in financing cash flows as a result of SFAS 123R accounting changes. Current year capital expenditures totaled $310.5 million compared to $238.6 million in the prior year, with the increase primarily due to the construction of our Las Vegas campus and growth in our gaming operations installed base.
     Working capital totaled $170.9 million at September 30, 2006 compared to $219.6 million at September 30, 2005. Our zero coupon convertible debentures are classified as current liabilities and included in working capital because the market price condition for convertibility is currently satisfied.
     Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $589.1 million at September 30, 2006 compared to $688.1 million at September 30, 2005. Debt totaled $832.4 million at September 30, 2006 compared to $811.0 million at September 30, 2005.
Capital Deployment
     On September 26, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirteen cents ($0.13) per share, which was paid on October 23, 2006 to shareholders of record on October 9, 2006. The dividend was increased from twelve and one-half cents ($0.125) per share in the previous quarter.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, and other expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
