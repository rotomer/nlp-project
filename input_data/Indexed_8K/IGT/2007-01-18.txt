Exhibit 99.1
      International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2006.
(Reno, NV  January 18, 2007)
     Net income in the first quarter totaled $121.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share versus $120.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
First quarter financial highlights:
     "IGT posted solid first quarter results, highlighted by continued growth in our gaming operations sector and record Adjusted EBITDA," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Our installed base of recurring revenue machines reached a record 53,100 games worldwide. We saw the first shipments into Pennsylvania, Florida racetracks and Arkansas this quarter and look forward to future development in these emerging markets. IGT continues to invest heavily in new markets and technology, and we remain focused on delivering the most complete line of industry-leading products and service to our global customers."
Gaming Operations
     First quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations improved to $324.9 million and $186.7 million, respectively, compared to $291.7 million and $165.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Gaming operations gross margins were consistent with the prior year at 57%. Revenue and gross profit growth was primarily driven by the increase in our installed base, with 9,800

incremental units from the prior year and 3,500 incremental units from the immediately preceding quarter.
     Year-over-year installed base growth was primarily the result of lease operations placements in Mexico, New York and Delaware, and casino operations placements in Oklahoma, California, Florida and Alabama. Sequential installed base growth occurred primarily in the lease operations markets of New York and Mexico, and the casino operations markets of Florida and Oklahoma.
Product Sales
     Worldwide product sales revenues produced first quarter gross profits of $165.3 million compared to $166.5 million in the prior year. Non-machine revenues (comprised of gaming systems, parts, service and other fees) totaled $84.8 million or 27% of total product sales versus $93.0 million or 29% in the comparable prior year quarter. Non-machine revenues were lower primarily as a result of fewer gaming system sales.
     North America product sales revenues improved slightly over prior year levels despite lower machine volume due to the mix of new AVP platform sales.

Non-machine revenues totaled $69.2 million or 33% of domestic product sales compared to $73.4 million or 36% in the same quarter last year, mostly due to fewer gaming systems sales partially offset by higher parts and conversion sales. Gross margins improved mainly due to product mix.
     International product sales totaled $110.1 million compared to $117.8 million in the prior year. Machine shipments totaled 14,600 versus 14,800 last year, with higher shipments into Japan offset by lower shipments into the UK, Australia and Europe. Non-machine revenues totaled $15.6 million or 14% of international product sales compared to $19.6 million or 17% last year.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     First quarter operating expenses increased to $166.8 million from $146.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to additional staffing costs to support business growth, higher legal and compliance costs, and a greater investment in research and development.
     Other income, net, increased to $4.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the prior year quarter, mostly as a result of higher interest income.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     IGT generated $223.5 million in operating cash flow on net income of $121.0 million, up 41% as compared to the same period in the prior year. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $103.8 million compared to $75.2 million in the prior year, with additional investments in property, plant and equipment in the current year.
     During the quarter, IGT issued $900.0 million of 2.6% convertible debentures due 2036 and announced the redemption of its outstanding zero-coupon convertible debentures due January 29, 2033. The offering of the 2.6% debentures closed on December 20, 2006, and the redemption of the zero-coupon debentures will be finalized in the second quarter. IGT used $225.4 million of the proceeds from the new bond offering to repurchase shares of its common stock. Additionally, IGT will
 
International Game Technology Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 Results Page 4 of 11
utilize approximately $612.0 million of the proceeds to fund the redemption and settlements of the zero-coupon convertible debentures.
     Due to the timing of the new debenture issuance and subsequent redemption of the old debentures, working capital increased to $852.4 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $129.1 million at September 30, 2006. Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006 versus $589.1 million at September 30, 2006. Debt totaled $1.5 billion (excluding accrued debenture settlements) at December 31, 2006 compared to $832.4 million at September 30, 2006.
Capital Deployment
     On December 5, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirteen cents ($0.13) per share, paid on January 2, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 19, 2006.
     IGT repurchased 4.9 million shares during the first quarter in conjunction with the new debenture issuance. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 6.5 million shares at December 31, 2006.
     Additionally, on December 21, 2006, IGT completed the acquisition of Venture Catalyst Incorporated ("VCAT") for a cash purchase price of $21.8 million.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest; taxes; depreciation, amortization and asset charges; share-based compensation; and other expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
