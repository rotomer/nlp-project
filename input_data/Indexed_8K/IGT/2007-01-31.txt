Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On December 20, 2006, International Game Technology (the "Company") announced that all of its outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures due January 29, 2033 (the "Debentures") would be redeemed on January 10, 2007. As a result of this announcement holders of the Debentures were entitled to exercise their rights, under the terms of the indentures under which the Debentures were issued, to convert their Debentures into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.00015625 per share (the "Common Stock") and, if applicable, cash. Since December 13, 2006, the date of filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the holders of approximately $963.3 million face value of the Debentures surrendered those Debentures for conversion.
The aggregate number of shares issued upon conversion of the surrendered Debentures was determined using a formula based in part upon the market price of Common Stock over an "applicable conversion reference period" which ended on January 26, 2007. From December 13, 2006 to January 31, 2007 the Company issued approximately 1.6 million shares of Common Stock and made cash payments for certain of the Debentures surrendered for conversion. On January 31, 2007, the Company issued an additional approximately 5.7 million shares of Common Stock and made additional cash payments in exchange for the balance of the Debentures surrendered for conversion.
The Company issued the Common Stock to the holders of the Debentures in reliance upon the exemption provided by section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act 1933.
