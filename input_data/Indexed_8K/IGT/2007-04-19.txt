Exhibit 99.1
      International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2007. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has increased the Company's share repurchase authorization by 50.0 million shares, bringing the total current authorization to 53.1 million shares.
(Reno, NV  April 19, 2007)
     For the three-month period ended March 31, 2007, net income totaled $128.2 million or $0.38 per diluted share versus $124.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. The second quarter of the current year included an insurance settlement related to Gulf Coast property damage and business interruption and a net benefit from the sale of a corporate asset, which together totaled $13.5 million, after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share.
     For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, net income totaled $249.2 million or $0.73 per diluted share compared to $244.6 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year.
Second quarter financial highlights:
     "IGT's gaming operations continue to thrive and expand, with an all-time high installed base of games driving another quarter of record financial results for the recurring revenue sector of our business," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Although the current macro-trends for domestic machine sales remain challenging, the strength and consistency of our gaming operations business and the steadily growing contributions from our international operations enhance IGT's ability to generate strong operating cash flow and post record Adjusted EBITDA results.

With the increase in our share repurchase authorization announced today, we reaffirm our confidence and optimism in the long-term future of our company and plan to continue our stock buyback program as part of our ongoing strategy to return significant capital to our shareholders."
Gaming Operations
     For the three-month period ended March 31, 2007, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations reached a record $341.1 million and $211.0 million, respectively, compared to $311.2 million and $183.9 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margins on gaming operations totaled 62% versus 59% in the prior year quarter. Margins in the current period were favorably impacted by reduced jackpot-related expense, as well as the property damage portion of the Gulf Coast insurance settlement of $5.0 million, before tax.
     For the six-month period ended March 31, 2007, revenues and gross profit totaled $666.0 million and $397.7 million, respectively, compared to $602.9 million and $349.4 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year improvement was attributed to the growth and enhanced performance of our installed base.
     The installed base of recurring revenue machines ended the quarter at a record 54,800 units, an increase of 10,400 units from the prior year quarter and 1,700 units from the immediately preceding quarter. Growth was primarily the result of incremental lease operations placements in Mexico, New York, Delaware and Rhode Island, and incremental casino operations placements in Oklahoma, California and Florida.

Product Sales
     Second quarter worldwide product sales revenues and gross profits totaled $268.6 million and $145.5 million, respectively, compared to $333.2 million and $166.3 million in the prior year. Domestic machine sales declined from the prior year as a result of lower market replacement demand and the timing of expansion opportunities. International machine sales declined as a result of fewer shipments of low-payout machines, mostly due to the timing of sales in Japan. Non-machine revenues increased slightly to $89.8 million versus $88.5 million last year. Consolidated product sales gross margins were 54% compared to 50% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the greater mix of higher margin non-machine sales and lower mix of international machine sales.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     Operating expenses totaled $154.3 million for the quarter and $321.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2007 compared to $157.5 million and $303.6 million in the prior year periods, respectively. Operating expenses in the current year were favorably impacted by $16.5 million, before tax, related to the business

interruption portion of the Gulf Coast insurance settlement and the net benefit from the sale of a corporate asset. Excluding these items, operating expenses increased primarily as a result of additional sales and administrative staffing costs in support of business growth initiatives, higher legal and compliance fees and a greater investment in research and development, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     For the six months ended March 31, 2007, IGT generated $366.5 million in operating cash flow on net income of $249.2 million. Year-to-date capital expenditures totaled $181.9 million compared to $134.5 million in the prior year, with additional investments in the current year related to the construction of our Las Vegas campus and an asset addition.
     Working capital totaled $857.6 million at March 31, 2007 compared to $129.1 million at September 30, 2006. The change in working capital was mainly due to the refinancing of our convertible debentures in the current year that were classified as current liabilities at September 30, 2006.
     Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $623.1 million at March 31, 2007 compared to $589.1 million at September 30, 2006. Debt totaled $1.1 billion at March 31, 2007 compared to $832.4 million at September 30, 2006.
Capital Deployment
     On March 5, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, which was paid on April 2, 2007 to shareholders of record on March 19, 2007.
     For the six months ended March 31, 2007, IGT repurchased 8.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $362.7 million. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program, after taking into account the increase in the authorization described above, totaled 53.1 million shares at April 19, 2007 or approximately 16% of total shares outstanding as of

Unaudited Supplemental Data
(In millions, except per share amounts)
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, and other income/expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
