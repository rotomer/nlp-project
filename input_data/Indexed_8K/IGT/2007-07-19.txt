Third quarter financial highlights:
     "IGT's record third quarter results reflect the power of our gaming operations business and strong double-digit growth in product sales," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Year-to-date, we have generated $564.9 million in cash flow from operations and returned $742.4 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. This quarter we also made strategic investments in China LotSynergy Holdings and Digideal Corporation, and entered into a significant five-year cooperation agreement with Casino Club of Argentina. These important investments, coupled with our focus on maintaining IGT's position as a leading worldwide provider of innovative gaming technology, will further expand both our product and geographic reach."

Gaming Operations
     Third quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations increased to $341.9 million and $210.6 million, respectively, compared to $314.8 million and $183.6 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations reached $1.0 billion and $608.3 million, respectively, compared to $917.7 million and $533.0 million in the same prior year period. Revenue and gross profit growth for the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by the expansion of our installed base.
     As of June 30, 2007, the installed base stood at a record 58,200 machines, with 12,000 incremental units from the prior year and 3,400 incremental units from the immediately preceding quarter. Year-over-year growth was primarily the result of lease operations placements in Mexico and New York, and casino operations placements in Oklahoma, Florida and California. Sequential installed base growth was primarily driven by incremental placements in Mexico and Florida.
     Gaming operations gross margins expanded to 62% for the quarter compared to 58% in the prior year. Year-to-date gross margins on gaming operations improved to 60% versus 58% last year. Gross margin improvements are primarily driven by lower jackpot expense and the mix of units in the installed base.

Product Sales
     Record worldwide product sales revenues produced third quarter gross profits of $186.0 million compared to $148.9 million in the prior year, mostly driven by strong machine sales both internationally and domestically. Growth in machine gross profit was primarily the result of the sale of 14,900 units in Japan during the quarter and an enhanced product mix that included a greater portion of AVP Trimline machines. Non-machine revenues (comprised of gaming systems, parts, service and other fees) totaled $91.6 million or 25% of total product sales versus $88.5 million or 30% in the comparable prior year quarter, with increases primarily in gaming systems.
     For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2007, worldwide product sales generated gross profits of $496.9 million versus $481.6 million in the prior year, despite lower overall shipments. Machine sales gross profit improved largely on the strength of sales into Japan, where shipments totaled 22,600 units year-to-date, as well as an enhanced product mix overall. Year-to-date, non-machine revenues were comparable to the prior year at $266.1 million or 28% of total product sales.

Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     Consolidated operating expenses totaled $180.3 million in the third quarter and $501.3 million year-to-date compared to $160.9 million and $464.6 million in the same prior year periods, respectively. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of additional sales and administrative staffing costs in support of business growth initiatives, higher legal and compliance costs, and a greater investment in research and development. These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt provisions. Operating expense for the current nine months was also reduced by $12.0 million of business interruption insurance proceeds and a $5.8 million gain on the sale of a corporate asset.
     Other income, net, decreased $2.9 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly as a result of higher interest expense.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     Year-to-date, IGT generated $564.9 million in operating cash flow on net income of $385.6 million, up 48% from the same prior year period. Capital expenditures increased to $260.1 million compared to $216.7 million in the prior year, mostly as a result of the ongoing construction of our new Las Vegas campus.
     Working capital increased to $605.3 million at June 30, 2007 compared to $129.1 million at September 30, 2006 primarily due to the refinancing of our convertible debentures in the current year previously classified as current liabilities at September 30, 2006.
     Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $361.4 million at June 30, 2007 versus $589.1 million at September 30, 2006. Debt totaled $1.1 billion at June 30, 2007 compared to $832.4 million at September 30, 2006.

Capital Deployment
     On June 25, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirteen cents ($0.13) per share, payable on July 23, 2007 to shareholders of record on July 9, 2007.
     During the third quarter, IGT repurchased 6.4 million shares for an aggregate cost of $248.8 million. Year-to-date, share repurchases totaled 14.6 million shares for an aggregate cost of $611.5 million. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 46.8 million shares at June 30, 2007.
     In the third quarter, IGT invested $104.8 million in China LotSynergy Holdings Limited (CLS), forming a strategic alliance that we believe will provide IGT access to the growing Chinese Lottery market while providing CLS with advanced gaming technology support. IGT also invested $30.9 million in Digideal Corporation to gain access to the company's intellectual property portfolio while assisting in the expansion of their game content library and electronic table game products.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
(In millions, except per share amounts)
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, and other income/expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
