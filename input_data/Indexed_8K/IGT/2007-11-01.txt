INDEX TO EXHIBITS

 
Exhibit 99.1
      International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.
(Reno, NV  November 1, 2007)
     Net income for the fiscal year increased to $508.2 million or $1.51 per diluted share compared to $473.6 million or $1.34 per diluted share in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled $122.6 million or $0.38 per diluted share versus $114.9 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Fiscal year financial highlights:
     "IGT achieved another record year in 2007, led by record revenue and placements of our gaming operations machines. Non-machine sales also reached record levels as our business model continues to evolve towards a greater focus on software and systems," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews. "Adjusted EBITDA reached $1.1 billion, and we generated a record level of cash flow from operations. All of these accomplishments, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, allowed IGT to return $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends in fiscal 2007."
Gaming Operations
     Fourth quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations reached a record $353.3 million and $214.7 million, respectively, compared to $333.8 million and

$197.0 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, revenues and gross profits were also records at $1.4 billion and $823.0 million, respectively. Increases in revenue for both the quarter and fiscal year were primarily driven by installed base growth.
     Gross margins on gaming operations were 61% for the quarter and 60% for the year, which compares to 59% and 58% in the same prior year periods, respectively. Favorable margin comparisons for the quarter and the year were mostly due to lower jackpot expense, as well as the changing mix of units in the installed base.
     The installed base of recurring revenue machines ended the year at a record 59,200 units, an increase of 9,600 units from the prior year and 1,000 units from the immediately preceding quarter. Year-over-year growth was primarily the result of incremental lease operations placements in Mexico and New York, and incremental casino operations placements in Florida, Oklahoma and California. Sequential installed base growth occurred primarily in the casino operations markets of Florida and Oklahoma.
Product Sales
 
International Game Technology Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 Results Page 3 of 10  
     Fourth quarter product sales worldwide generated revenues and gross profits of $309.6 million and $161.0 million, respectively, compared to $304.9 million and $160.0 million in the prior year. Record non-machine revenues of $118.1 million increased 26% from the prior year, comprising 38% of total product sales revenues, but were mostly offset by lower total machine sales. We recognized stronger international machines sales driven by increased shipments in Japan and Australia which partially offset lower domestic machine sales. Growth in gaming systems sales primarily drove record non-machine sales. Total product sales gross margins were consistent with the prior year quarter at 52%.
     For the year, worldwide product sales revenues were comparable to the prior year, but gross profits improved 3% to $657.8 million. Lower domestic machine sales were offset by record non-machine sales and stronger international shipments, primarily in Japan and Asia. Non-machine revenues increased 6% to a record $384.2 million and comprised 30% of total product sales revenues. Growth in non-machine revenues was driven primarily by higher gaming systems sales worldwide. Total product sales gross margins were 52% for the year, up from 51% in fiscal 2006 primarily due to the greater mix of non-machine sales.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     Operating expenses totaled $179.1 million for the quarter and $680.5 million for the year compared to $182.0 million and $646.6 million in the prior year periods, respectively. The prior year quarter included a charge totaling $11.3 million related to the buyout of a third-party development contract. Operating expenses for the current year were reduced by $12.0 million of business interruption insurance proceeds and a $5.8 million gain on the sale of a corporate airplane, both realized during the second quarter.
     Excluding the items above, fourth quarter and full year operating expenses were higher mostly due to additional sales and administrative staffing costs to support business growth and a greater investment in research and development. For the year, higher legal and compliance fees also contributed to increased operating expenses.

     Other income, net, decreased $13.3 million from the prior year quarter and $17.3 million from the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of higher interest expense on our 2.6% convertible debentures and additional borrowings under our credit facility.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     IGT generated $821.5 million in operating cash flows on net income of $508.2 million. Operating cash flows improved 32% from the prior year primarily due to lower pre-payments for licensing rights and reduced inventory levels, as well as increased net income. Current year capital expenditures totaled $344.3 million compared to $310.5 million in the prior year. Current year spending included the ongoing construction of our Las Vegas campus and the purchase of a corporate airplane.
     Working capital totaled $595.5 million at September 30, 2007 compared to $129.1 million at September 30, 2006 primarily due to the refinancing of convertible debentures during the current year. Prior to the refinancing, the previously outstanding convertible debentures were classified as current liabilities.
     Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $400.7 million at September 30, 2007 compared to $589.1 million at September 30, 2006. Debt totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2007 compared to $0.8 billion at September 30, 2006. These fluctuations are primarily related to increased share repurchases during fiscal 2007.
Capital Deployment
     On September 25, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of fourteen cents ($0.14) per share, which was paid on October 23, 2007 to shareholders of record on October 9, 2007. The dividend was increased from thirteen cents ($0.13) per share in the previous quarter.
     During the quarter, IGT repurchased 13.5 million shares for an aggregate cost of $506.9 million and an average price of $37.47 per share. For the year, IGT repurchased 28.2 million shares for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion and an average price of $39.70 per share. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 33.2 million shares at September 30, 2007.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
(In millions, except per share amounts)
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, and other income/expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
