Exhibit 99.1
      International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2007.
(Reno, NV  January 17, 2008)
     Consolidated revenues and gross profit for the quarter were $645.8 million and $366.5 million, respectively, compared to $642.3 million and $352.0 million in the prior year quarter. Consolidated gross margins for the first quarter came in at 57%, up from 55% in the prior year quarter. Net income in the first quarter totaled $113.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $121.0 million and $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
     "During the first quarter, IGT made progress towards achieving our long-term objectives, including demonstrating at the Global Gaming Expo this past November our vision for the right slot floor today and in the future. Operationally we continued to generate margin improvements and moderate revenue growth despite reduced marketplace demand," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews.
Gaming Operations
     First quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations improved to $332.3 million and $199.4 million, respectively, compared to $324.9 million and $186.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Gaming operations gross margins for the first quarter were 60% compared with the prior year quarter at 57%. Revenue and gross profit growth were primarily driven by an increase of 5,700 units in our installed base from the prior year quarter.

     Year-over-year lease operations placements increased 2,300 units, mainly in Mexico, New York and Rhode Island. Casino operations placements increased 3,400 units year-over-year as a result of expansion in Oklahoma and Florida. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, casino operations units increased 100 units and lease operations units were down 500 due to temporary removals in Mexico.
Product Sales
     Worldwide product sales revenues produced first quarter revenues and gross profits of $313.5 million and $167.2 million, respectively, compared to $317.4 million and $165.3 million in the prior year quarter. Worldwide shipments totaled 20,200 units compared to 26,800 units in the first quarter of last year. Gross profits increased despite the 25% reduction in shipments due to favorable product and geographic mix. Non-machine revenues increased to $99.3 million or 32% of total product sales from $84.8 million or 27% of total product sales in the comparable prior year quarter, primarily as a result of growth in network systems sales.

     North America shipments of 7,300 units were off 40% from the comparable prior year quarter total of 12,200, while product sales revenues decreased only 19% for the same period. Non-machine revenues were $76.1 million in the first quarter or 46% of product sales, up from $69.2 million or 33% of product sales in the prior year quarter. Units shipped were down due to a reduction in replacement demand.
     International product sales revenues improved 33% from the comparable prior year quarter due to favorable product mix. During the first quarter, international machine shipments totaled 12,900 units versus 14,600 units last year, with lower shipments into Japan and the UK partially offset by increased shipments into all other international markets. Non-machine revenues totaled $23.2 million or 16% of international product sales compared to $15.6 million or 14% in the prior year quarter.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
     First quarter operating expenses increased to $170.8 million from $166.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to additional staffing initiatives and a greater investment in research and development.
     Other expense, net, was $7.6 million in the first quarter compared to other income, net, of $4.5 million in the prior year quarter. Higher other expense was driven by increased interest expense from additional borrowings under our credit facility.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheet
     IGT generated $120.2 million in operating cash flow on net income of $113.7 million in the first quarter, down from $223.5 million and $121.0 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow decreased primarily due to additional prepayments to secure long-term licensing rights and timing of payments in working capital. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $62.7 million compared to $103.8 million in the prior year quarter.

Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $415.8 million at December 31, 2007 versus $400.7 million at September 30, 2007. Debt totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2007.

     IGT repurchased 3.5 million shares during the first quarter for a total cost of $149.2 million. The remaining authorization under the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 29.8 million shares at December 31, 2007.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including asset charges, share-based compensation, and other income/expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
