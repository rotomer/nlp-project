(Reno, NV  October 30, 2008)
 
"Our fiscal 2008 results reflect challenging economic operating conditions affecting our customers and in turn our business," said Chairman and CEO TJ Matthews.  "Despite these challenges, we remained focused on key business initiatives.  During 2008, IGT released several new models on our Advanced Video Platform (AVP) and released close to 700 game titles worldwide across all platforms.  We made significant progress in the development of our server-based gaming initiatives and will begin commercially deploying initial versions of this technology in 2009."
Gaming Operations
Fourth quarter gaming operations revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $331.0 million and $192.7 million, respectively, compared to $353.3 million and $214.7 million for the same quarter last year.For the year ended September 30, 2008, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $1.3 billion and $778.1 million, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and $823.0 million in

the prior year.   Revenues and gross profit decreased primarily due to lower play levels and continued shifts in installed base mix to include more lower-yielding, stand-alone lease and central determination machines.
For the current quarter and fiscal year, gross margins on gaming operations were 58% compared to 61% and 60%, respectively, in the prior year.  The current quarter was primarily affected by lower play levels. For the fiscal year, gross margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable interest rates and technological obsolescence related to the transition to new products, as well as the prior year hurricane property insurance gain.  
As of September 30, 2008, our gaming operations installed base totaled 60,500 units, an increase of 400 units from the immediately preceding quarter and the prior year quarter.  Installed base growth in international markets and domestic lottery markets was partially offset by reductions in Florida and California Class II markets as these markets transitioned to Class III for-sale games.  As of September 30, 2008, approximately 74% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.  Based on yield threshold considerations, the current reported installed base and historical comparisons have been revised to reflect approximately 900 international units previously excluded from current and historical periods.  Gaming operations revenues were not impacted by this adjustment in our reported installed base.< /P>

Product Sales
Worldwide product sales generated fourth quarter gross profit of $161.7 million compared to $161.0 million in the prior year. Non-machine revenues (gaming systems, parts, conversions and other fees) comprised 31% of total product sales versus 38% in the comparable prior year quarter.Domestic shipments increased due to the release of our new AVP models in the fourth quarter.  Internationally, lower shipments into Japan compared to the prior year quarter were partially offset by increased shipments into Latin America.  
 
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, worldwide product sales generated gross profit of $641.0 million versus $657.8 million in the prior year, reflecting a reduction in machine revenues due to continued slow domestic replacement demand and lower Japan sales.Non-machine revenues comprised 33% of total product sales for fiscal 2008 compared to 30% of total product sales in the prior year.  The increase in non-machine revenues was driven by increased intellectual property licensing fees and systems sales.
  
Additionally, revenues from approximately 1,800 machines shipped during the fourth quarter are expected to be included in our next fiscal quarter.  Deferred revenue, including the 1,800 machines, increased approximately $38.1 million during the quarter to a total of $62.1 million as of September 30, 2008.  This increase is the result of our

continued shift toward more multi-element contracts including systems and software sales.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
Fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $204.4 million compared to $179.1 million in the prior year period.  Higher legal and compliance fees and staffing costs comprised the majority of the increase.  For the full year, operating expenses increased to $759.8 million compared to $680.5 million in fiscal 2007, primarily due to higher staffing costs, bad debt provisions, and legal and compliance fees, as well as prior year gains from hurricane insurance and the sale of a corporate airplane.
Other expense, net, in the fourth quarter increased $44.4 million to $46.8 million, largely due to $28.6 million related to write-downs of our investments in China LotSynergy Holdings and Progressive Gaming International Corporation.  Other expense for the full year increased $73.0 million from fiscal 2007 to $68.5 million.  These increases were also driven by additional interest expense on higher borrowings, reduced interest income and unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses.  
Cash Flows and Balance Sheet
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, IGT generated$516.3 million in cash from operations on net income of $342.5 million compared to $821.5 million on net income of $508.2 million in the prior year period.  Reductions in year-over-year cash from operations were primarily the result of lower earnings, increased inventory, additional prepayments to secure long-term licensing rights and increases in accounts receivable.  
Working capital increased to $733.4 million at September 30, 2008 compared to $595.5 million at September 30, 2007.Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $374.4 million at September 30, 2008 versus $400.7 million at September 30, 2007.Debt totaled $2.3 billion at September 30, 2008 compared to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2007.  The available capacity on our $2.5 billion line of credit totaled $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2008.
