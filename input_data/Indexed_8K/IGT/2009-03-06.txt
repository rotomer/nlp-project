Item 5.02
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) At the annual meeting on March 3, 2009, International Game Technology (IGT) shareholders approved an amendment to the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (SIP) to increase the aggregate number of shares of IGT common stock that may be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under the SIP to 58.0 million from 43.0 million shares.  The amendment also increased the limit on the number of shares that may be delivered pursuant to "incentive stock options" granted under the SIP to 58.0 million shares.  For purposes of clarity, any shares that are delivered pursuant to incentive stock options also count against (and are not in addition to) the aggregate SIP share limit.
Except as amended as described above, the current share limits under, and other terms and conditions of, the SIP will continue in effect.

"Corporation" means International Game Technology, a Nevada corporation, and "Company" means the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, collectively.  These terms and other capitalized terms are defined in Article VIII.
1.2

1.4
Shares Available for Awards; Share Limits
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, the capital stock that may be delivered under this Plan shall be shares of the Corporation's authorized but unissued Common Stock and any shares of its Common Stock held as treasury shares.  The shares may be delivered for any lawful consideration.  Subject to adjustment as provided in or pursuant to this Section 1.4 or Section 6.2:
(a)
.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to all Awards granted under this Plan shall not exceed 58,000,000* shares of Common Stock.
Aggregate Share Limits
(b)
.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted under this Plan during any fiscal year to any individual shall not exceed 4,000,000 shares.  Additional limits are in Section 5.2(c).
Individual Limits
(c)
.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Options intended as Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan shall not exceed 58,000,000*
Incentive Stock Option Limit
(d)
.  Shares issued in respect of any "Full-Value Award" granted under this Plan shall be counted against the aggregate share limits set forth in Section 1.4(a) above as four (4) shares for every one (1) share actually issued in connection with such Award.  (For example, if a Stock Bonus of 100 shares of Common Stock is granted under this Plan, 400 shares shall be charged against the applicable share limit in Section 1.4(a) in connection with that Award.)  For this purpose, a "Full-Value Award" means any Award under this Plan that is either: (1) a delivery of shares in respect of Option grants, or (2) a delivery of shares in respect of Stock Appreciation Right grants.
Full-Value Awards
not
(e)
.  No Award may be granted under this Plan unless, on the date of grant, the sum of (i) the maximum number of shares issuable at any time pursuant to such Award, plus (ii) the number of shares that have previously been issued pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan, other than reacquired shares available for reissue consistent with any applicable legal limitations, plus (iii) the maximum number of shares that may be issued at any time after such date of grant pursuant to Awards that are outstanding on such date, does not exceed the applicable limit under Section 1.4(a) or other any other limit set forth above in this Section 1.4.  Shares that are subject to or underlie Awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under this Plan shall agai n, except to the extent prohibited
Share Reservation; Replenishment and Reissue of Unvested Awards
*
The current aggregate share limit is 43,000,000 shares and the current limit on Incentive Stock Option grants is also 43,000,000 shares.  Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the Plan that would increase each of these limits by an additional 15,000,000 shares (so that the new aggregate share limit for the Plan and the new Incentive Stock Option limit for the Plan would each be 58,000,000 shares).
by law, be available for subsequent Awards under this Plan and shall not count against the applicable limit under Section 1.4(a) or any other limit set forth above in this Section 1.4.  Shares that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Corporation as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under this Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under this Plan.  In instances where a Stock Appreciation Right or other Award is settled in cash or any form other than shares of Common Stock, no shares shall be counted against the applicable limit under Section 1.4(a) or any other limit set forth above in this Section 1.4.  The payment of cash dividends and dividend equivalents in conjunction with outstanding Awards shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance under this Plan.  Any shares that are issued by the Company, and any awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company or an affiliate of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company (or previously granted by a predecessor employer (or direct or indirect parent thereof) in the case of persons that become employed by the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate) in connection with a business or asset acquisition or similar transaction) shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance under this Plan.
(f)
.  Adjustments to the share limit set forth in Section 1.4(a) as well as the other limits set forth above are subject to any applicable limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to Awards intended as performance-based compensation thereunder.
Section 162(m)
1.5
Grant of Awards
Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall determine the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each Award, the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the Award and, in the case of Performance Share Awards, in addition to matters addressed in Section 1.2(b), the specific objectives, goals and performance criteria (such as an increase in sales, market value, earnings or book value over a base period, the years of service before vesting, the relevant job classification or level of responsibility or other factors) that further define the terms of the Performance Share Award.  Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the Award established by the Committee consistent with the specific provisions of this Plan.
1.6
Award Period
Each Award and all executory rights or obligations under the related Award Agreement shall expire on such date (if any) as shall be determined by the Committee, but in the case of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or other rights to acquire Common Stock not later than ten (10) years after the Award Date.
1.7
Limitations on Exercise and Vesting of Awards
(a)
.  Unless the Committee expressly provides otherwise, no Award shall be exercisable or shall vest until at least six months after the initial Award Date, and once exercisable an Award shall remain exercisable until the expiration or earlier termination of the Award.
Exercise
(b)
.  Any exercisable Award may be exercised in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.
Procedure
(c)
.  Fractional share interests shall be disregarded, but may be accumulated.  The Committee, however, may determine that cash, other securities or other property will be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional share interests.  No fewer than 100 shares may be purchased on exercise of any Award at one time unless the number purchased is the total number at the time available for purchase under the Award.
Fractional Shares/Minimum Issue
1.8
Acceptance of Notes to Finance Exercise
The Corporation may, with the Committee's approval, accept one or more notes from any Eligible Person in connection with the exercise or receipt of any outstanding Award; provided that any such note shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
(a)
The principal of the note shall not exceed the amount required to be paid to the Corporation upon the exercise or receipt of one or more Awards under this Plan and the note shall be delivered directly to the Corporation in consideration of such exercise or receipt.
(b)
The initial term of the note shall be determined by the Committee; provided that the term of the note, including extensions, shall not exceed a period of 10 years.
(c)
The note shall provide for full recourse to the Participant and shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Committee but not less than the applicable imputed interest rate specified by the Code.
(d)
If the employment of the Participant terminates, the unpaid principal balance of the note shall become due and payable on the 10th business day after such termination; provided, however, that if a sale of such shares would cause such Participant to incur liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the unpaid balance shall become due and payable on the 10th business day after the first day on which a sale of such shares could have been made without incurring such liability assuming for these purposes that there are no other transactions by the Participant subsequent to such termination.
(e)
If required by the Committee or by applicable law, the note shall be secured by a pledge of any shares or rights financed thereby in compliance with applicable law.
(f)
The terms, repayment provisions, and collateral release provisions of the note and the pledge securing the note shall conform with applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board as then in effect.
1.9
No Transferability
(a)
.  Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 1.9, by applicable law and by the Award Agreement, as the same may be amended, (i) all Awards are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (ii) Awards shall
Limit On Exercise and Transfer
be exercised only by the Participant; and (iii) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to an Award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the Participant.
(b)
.  The Committee may permit Awards to be exercised by certain persons or entities related to the Participant, including but not limited to members of the Participant's family, charitable institutions, or trusts or other entities whose beneficiaries or beneficial owners are members of the Participant's family and/or charitable institutions, or to such other persons or entities as may be approved by the Committee, pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Committee may establish.  Any permitted transfer shall be subject to the condition that the Committee receive evidence satisfactory to it that the transfer is being made for estate and/or tax planning purposes on a gratuitous or donative basis and without consideration (other than nominal consideration).
Exceptions
(c)
.  The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 1.9(a) shall not apply to:  
Further Exceptions to Limits On Transfer
(i)
transfers to the Corporation (for example, in connection with the cancellation or termination of the Award),
(ii)
the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the Participant's death or, if the Participant has died, transfers to or exercise by the Participant's beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution,
(iii)
transfers pursuant to a QDRO if approved or ratified by the Committee,
(iv)
if the Participant has suffered a disability, permitted transfers or exercises on behalf of the Participant by his or her legal representative, or
(v)
the authorization by the Committee of "cashless exercise" procedures with third parties who provide financing for the purpose of (or who otherwise facilitate) the exercise of Awards consistent with applicable laws and the express authorization of the  Committee.
(d)
.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards may not be transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and in all events shall be subject to any and all applicable transfer restrictions under the Code.
Limitations on Incentive Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards
2.1
Grants
One or more Options may be granted under this Article to any Eligible Person.  Each Option granted may be either an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, or an Option not so intended, and such intent shall be indicated in the applicable Option Agreement.
2.2
Option Price
(a)
.  The purchase price per share of the Common Stock covered by each Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Option is granted, but in no case shall such purchase price be less than 100% (110% in the case of an Option intended as an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant described in Section 2.4) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Award Date.
Pricing Limits
(b)
.  The purchase price of any shares purchased on exercise of an Option granted under this Article shall be paid in full at the time of each purchase in one or a combination of the following methods:  (i) in cash or by electronic funds transfer; (ii) by check payable to the order of the Corporation; (iii) if authorized by the Committee or specified in the applicable Option Agreement, by a promissory note of the Participant consistent with the requirements of Section 1.8; (iv) by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Committee; or (v) by the delivery of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation already owned by the Participant, that the Committee may in its absolute discretion limit the Participant's ability to exercise an Option by delivering such shares.  Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an Option shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise.  Any shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an Option that were initially acquired upon exercise of a stock option must have been owned by the Participant for at least six months prior to such use.
Payment Provisions
provided, however,
In addition to the payment methods described above, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an Option can be exercised in accordance with such cashless exercise procedures as the Committee may adopt in the circumstances.
2.3
Limitations on Grant and Terms of Incentive Stock Options
(a)
.  To the extent that the aggregate "Fair Market Value" of stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to Incentive Stock Options under this Plan and stock subject to Incentive Stock Options under all other plans of the Company or any parent corporation, such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options.  For this purpose, the "Fair Market Value" of the stock subject to options shall be determined as of the date the options were granted.  In reducing the number of options treated as Incentive Stock Options to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first.  To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Committee may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option.
$100,000 Limit
(b)
.  Each Incentive Stock Option and all rights thereunder shall expire no later than ten years after the Award Date.
Option Period
(c)
.  There shall be imposed in any Award Agreement relating to Incentive Stock Options such terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the Option be an "incentive stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code.
Other Code Limits
2.4
Limits on 10% Holders
No Incentive Stock Option may be granted to any person who, at the time the Option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such Option is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option and such Option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such Option is granted.
3.1
Grants
In its discretion, the Committee may grant a Stock Appreciation Right to any Eligible Person either concurrently with the grant of another Award or in respect of an outstanding Award, in whole or in part, or independently of any other Award.  Any Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option shall contain such terms as may be required to comply with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the holder otherwise agrees.
3.2
Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
(a)
.  Unless the Award Agreement or the Committee otherwise provides, a Stock Appreciation Right related to another Award shall be exercisable at such time or times, and to the extent, that the related Award shall be exercisable.
Exercisability
(b)
.  To the extent that a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised and settled in the form of Common Stock (as opposed to cash or other property), the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the applicable share limit(s) under Section 1.4 as opposed to only counting the number of shares actually issued.  (For purposes of clarity, if a Stock Appreciation Right relates to 100,000 shares and is exercised at a time when the payment due to the Participant with respect to such exercise is 15,000 shares, 100,000 shares shall be charged against the applicable share limit(s) under Section 1.4 with respect to such exercise.)  See Section 1.4(e) as to Stock Appreciation Rights paid in a form other than a Common Stock payment.  The number of shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right, and the related Option (if any), of a Partici pant shall be reduced by the number of underlying shares as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.
Effect on Available Shares
(c)
.  A Stock Appreciation Right granted independently of any other Award shall be exercisable pursuant to the terms of the Award Agreement.
Stand-Alone Stock Appreciation Rights
3.3
Payment
(a)
.  Unless the Committee otherwise provides, upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right and the attendant surrender of an exercisable portion of any related Award, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying
Amount
(i)
the difference obtained by subtracting the exercise price per share of Common Stock under the related Award (if applicable) or the initial share value specified in the Award, which in either case shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Award Date, from the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right, by
(ii)
the number of shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised.  
(b)
.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the form in which payment shall be made of the amount determined under paragraph (a) above, either solely in cash, solely in shares of Common Stock (valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right), or partly in such shares and partly in cash, provided that the Committee shall have determined that such exercise and payment are consistent with applicable law.  If the Committee permits the Participant to elect to receive cash or shares (or a combination thereof) on such exercise, any such election shall be subject to such conditions as the Committee may impose.
Form of Payment
3.4
Limited Stock Appreciation Rights
The Committee may grant to any Eligible Person Stock Appreciation Rights exercisable only upon or in respect of a change in control or any other specified event ("Limited SARs") and such Limited SARs may relate to or operate in tandem or combination with or substitution for Options, other Stock Appreciation Rights or other Awards (or any combination thereof), and may be payable in cash or shares based on the spread between the base price of the Stock Appreciation Right and a price based upon the Fair Market Value of the shares during a specified period or at a specified time within a specified period before, after or including the date of such event.
4.1
Grants
(a)
.  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant one or more Restricted Stock Awards to any Eligible Person.  Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Participant, the date of such issuance, the consideration for such shares (but not less than the minimum lawful consideration under applicable state law), the extent (if any) to which and the time (if ever) at which the Participant shall be entitled to dividends, voting and other rights in respect of the shares prior to vesting and the restrictions (which may be based on performance criteria, the passage of time or such other facts as the Committee may provide or any combination thereof) imposed on such shares and the conditions of release or lapse of such restrictions.  Such restrictions shall not lapse earlier than 12 months after the Award Date, except to the extent the Committee may otherwise provide.  Stock certificates evidencing shares of Restricted Stock pending the lapse of the restrictions ("restricted shares") shall bear a legend making appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed hereunder and (if in certificate form) shall be held by the Corporation or by a third party designated by the Committee until the restrictions on such shares shall have lapsed
Restricted Stock
and the shares shall have vested in accordance with the provisions of the Award and Section 1.7.  Upon issuance of the Restricted Stock Award, the Participant may be required to provide such further assurance and documents as the Committee may require to enforce the restrictions.
(b)
.  The Committee may, in its discretion, authorize and grant to any Eligible Person a Stock Unit Award or the crediting of Stock Units for services rendered or to be rendered or in lieu of other compensation, consistent with other applicable terms of this Plan, may permit an Eligible Person to irrevocably elect to defer by means of Stock Units or receive in Stock Units all or a portion of any Award hereunder, or may grant Stock Units in lieu of, in exchange for, in respect of, or in addition to any other Compensation or Award under this Plan.  The specific terms, conditions, and provisions relating to each Stock Unit grant or election, including the applicable vesting and payout provisions of the Stock Units and the form of payment to be made at or following the vesting thereof, shall be set forth in or pursuant to the applicable agreement or Award and any relevant Company deferred co mpensation plan, in form substantially as approved by the Committee.
Stock Units
(c)
.  The Committee in the applicable Award Agreement or the relevant Company deferred compensation plan may permit the Participant to elect the form and time of payout of vested Stock Units on such conditions or subject to such procedures as the Committee may impose, and may permit Restricted Stock or Stock Unit offsets or other provision for payment of any applicable taxes that may be due on the crediting, vesting or payment in respect of the Stock Units.
Payouts
4.2
Restrictions
(a)
.  Except as provided in Section 4.1 and 1.9, restricted shares comprising any Restricted Stock Award and rights in respect to Stock Unit Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, until the restrictions on such shares (or units in the case of a Stock Unit Award) have lapsed and the shares have become vested (or amounts paid in respect of the Stock Units).
Pre-Vesting Restraints
(b)
.  Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Award shall be entitled to cash dividend and voting rights for all shares issued even though they are not vested, provided that such rights shall terminate immediately as to any restricted shares which cease to be eligible for vesting.  Restricted Stock Awards and Stock Unit Awards may include dividend equivalent rights to the extent authorized by the Committee.
Dividend and Voting Rights
(c)
.  If the Participant shall have paid or received cash (including any payments in respect of dividends) in connection with the Restricted Stock Award or Stock Unit Award, the Award Agreement shall specify whether and to what extent such cash shall be returned (with or without an earnings factor) as to any restricted shares or Stock Units which cease to be eligible for vesting.
Cash Payments
4.3
Return to the Corporation
Unless the Committee otherwise expressly provides, restricted shares or Stock Units that remain subject to restrictions at the time of termination of employment or service or are subject to other conditions to vesting that have not been satisfied by the time specified in the applicable Award Agreement shall not vest and shall be returned to the Corporation or cancelled, as the case may be, in such manner and on such terms as the Committee shall therein provide.
5.1
Grants of Performance Share Awards
The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Performance Share Awards to Eligible Persons based upon such factors as the Committee shall deem relevant in light of the specific type and terms of the award.  An Award Agreement shall specify the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (if any) subject to the Performance Share Award, the consideration (but not less than the minimum lawful consideration) to be paid for any such shares as may be issuable to the Participant, the duration of the Award and the conditions upon which delivery of any shares or cash to the Participant shall be based.  The amount of cash or shares or other property that may be deliverable pursuant to such Award shall be based upon the degree of attainment over a specified period (a "performance cycle") as may be established by the Committee of such measure(s) of the performance of the Company (or any part thereof) or the P articipant as may be established by the Committee.  The Committee may provide for full or partial credit, prior to completion of such performance cycle or the attainment of the performance achievement specified in the Award, in the event of the Participant's death, or Total Disability, a Change in Control Event or in such other circumstances as the Committee consistent with Section 6.10(c)(2), if applicable, may determine.
5.2
Special Performance-Based Share Awards
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and in addition to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under other provisions of this Plan which are intended to satisfy the exception for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code (with such Awards hereinafter referred to as a "Qualifying Option" or a "Qualifying Stock Appreciation Right," respectively), other performance-based awards within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code ("Performance-Based Awards"), whether in the form of restricted stock, performance stock, phantom stock, Cash-Based Awards, or other rights, the grant, vesting, exercisability or payment of which depends on the degree of achievement of the Performance Goals relative to preestablished targeted levels for the Corporation on a consolidated, segment, subsidiary, business division, channel or other operating gr oup basis, may be granted under this Plan.  Any Qualifying Option or Qualifying Stock Appreciation Right shall be subject only to the requirements of Section 5.3(a) in order for such Award to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.
(a)
.  The eligible class of persons for Performance-Based Awards under this Section 5.2 shall be key employees (including officers) of the Company.
Eligible Class
(b)
.  The specific performance goals for Performance-Based Awards granted under this Section (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying Stock Appreciation Rights) shall be, on an absolute or relative basis, one or more of the Performance Goals, as selected by the Committee in its sole discretion.  The Committee shall establish in the applicable Award Agreement the specific performance target(s) relative to the Performance Goal(s) which must be attained before the compensation under the Performance-Based Award becomes payable.  The specific targets shall be determined within the time period permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code (and any regulations issued thereunder) so that such targets are considered to be preestablished and so that the attainment of such targets is substantially uncertain at the time of their establishment.  The applicable performanc e measurement period may not be less than three months nor more than 10 years.
Performance Goal Alternatives
(c)

Corporate Transactions - Assumption and Termination of Awards
a cash payment in settlement of, or for the assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding share-based Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding share-based Awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event.  Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Committee has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the Award or the Award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances, each Award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportu nity to exercise his or her outstanding vested Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting required in the circumstances) in accordance with their terms before the termination of such Awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of the impending termination be required and any acceleration of vesting and any exercise of any portion of an Award that is so accelerated may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event).
The Committee may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding Awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the Award.  In any of the events referred to in this Section 6.2(b), the Committee may take such action contemplated by this Section 6.2(b) prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Committee deems the action necessary to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares.

The Committee may override the limitations on acceleration in this Section 6.2(c) by express provision in the Award Agreement and may accord an y Eligible Person a right to refuse any acceleration, whether pursuant to the Award Agreement or otherwise, in such circumstances as the Committee may approve.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may deem an acceleration to occur immediately prior to the applicable event and/or reinstate the original terms of an Award if an event giving rise to acceleration does not occur.
