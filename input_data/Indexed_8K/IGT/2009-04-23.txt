 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) reported financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2009.
(Reno, NV  April 23, 2009)
Net income for the quarter was $38.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $68.4 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.  For the six month period ended March 31, 2009, net income was $104.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to $182.1 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Both the current and prior year three and six month periods were unfavorably impacted by a number of significant items.  A supplemental schedule detailing these items is included at the end of this release.  
"Our second quarter saw continued difficult economic conditions worldwide impacting our financial results, but in a number of jurisdictions we are beginning to see stability in play levels," said CEO Patti Hart.  "While the environment has been challenging, the success of our innovative new products and business efficiency initiatives give us confidence in our future prospects.  In my first month as CEO, I have seen the determination of our employees to capitalize on our industry leadership, and I am confident the results of our efforts will allow IGT to emerge a stronger company once we experience a period of sustained economic stabilization."

Reports 2009 Second Quarter Results
Page 2 of 9
Gaming operations quarterly revenues and gross profit declined 14% and 6%, respectively, over the prior year quarter.  Declines were the result of lower play levels as well as growth in the mix of stand alone and lease operations games in our installed base.  Gross margin was 59% in the quarter compared to 54% in the prior year quarterThe prior year margin was negatively impacted by additional jackpot expense associated with a sharp decline in interest rates and charges for technological obsolescence during that quarter.
.  
Our installed base of recurring revenue games increased to 61,300 units, up 1,700 units or 3% from the prior year and up 400 units from the previous sequential quarter.   The increase over the prior year was driven by growth in international placements partially offset by a reduction in domestic CDS/Class II and Class III markets.
Product Sales
Product sales revenues and gross profit in the second quarter declined 22% and 31%, respectively, while units shipped worldwide increased 4% over the prior year period.  On a regional basis for the quarter, North America revenues decreased 14% driven by a decline in replacement sales partially offset by increased sales of new/expansion units.  International revenues declined 35% for the quarter as a result of a less favorable geographic mix of sales, with fewer shipments into casino markets partially offset by increased shipments into Japan and the UK.  Total consolidated gross margin on product sales for the quarter was 48% compared to 55% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a greater proportion of lower margin sales in Japan and the UK and lower levels of non-machines revenues.  
Operating Expenses, Other Expense and Taxes
Operating expenses totaled $189.8 million for the quarter, an increase of $5.9 million over the prior year quarter and a sequential decrease of $16.0 million.  SG&A, excluding restructuring costs and bad debt provisions, was $96.4 million in the current quarter, a decline of $7.2 or 7%, from the prior sequential quarter.
Other expense, net, totaled $11.6 million, up from $8.8 million in the prior year quarter.  The increase was mostly driven by higher interest on increased borrowings and losses on foreign currency exchange, partially offset by gains on investments and retirement of debt.

The tax rate for the quarter was 34.6% compared to 41.9% in the prior year, mostly due to favorable discrete tax items.  Excluding these items, the current quarter tax rate would have been approximately 38.0% compared to 37.6% in the prior year quarter.
Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment
For the six months ended March 31, 2009, IGT generated $206.1 million in cash from operations on net income of $104.0 million compared to $195.0 million on net income of $182.1 million in the prior year period.

Unaudited Supplemental Data
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including fixed asset charges, share-based compensation, restructuring charges, and other income/expense, net) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparab le to those presented by other companies.
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations. Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
