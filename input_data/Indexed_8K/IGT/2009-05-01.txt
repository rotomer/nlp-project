EXHIBIT 99.1
Federal Court Rules Bally Infringes IGT's Bonusing Patents
-- International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today that Judge Sue L. Robinson of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that Bally Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BYI), and its affiliates Bally Gaming International, Inc. and Bally Gaming, Inc., infringed IGT's U.S. Patent Nos. RE37, 885 (the "885 patent") and RE38, 812 (the "812 patent").  The court ruled that Ballys Power Rewards technology infringed claims 10, 33, and 46 of the 885 patent and claims 21 and 44 of the 812 patent, and that Ballys ACSC Power Winners infringed claims 10 and 46 of the 885 patent.  The court also granted IGTs motion for summary judgment that the 885 and 812 patents are valid.
(Reno, Nev.-- April 29, 2009)
                In the same order, Judge Robinson denied Bally's motion for a ruling that IGT's U.S. Patent No. 6,431,983 ("the 983 patent") is invalid but found that Bally's "SDS Power Winners did not infringe the 885 patent and that Ballys Power Bank and Power Promotions did not infringe the 983 patent.
                IGT filed this lawsuit against Bally in 2006. The lawsuit alleges that the infringement has taken place despite defendants knowledge that IGTs patents cover the Bally Power Bonusing technology.  The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and an injunction.  IGT expects there will be a trial to assess damages following a period of related discovery.
                We are pleased that the court has affirmed the validity of our patents and their infringement.  We believe strongly in the United States patent system and the need to protect our intellectual property and respect the valid intellectual property rights of others," said Patti Hart, IGT's President and Chief Executive Officer.
