Our fiscal 2009 results reflect a challenging operating environment which we believe stabilized during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, said CEO Patti Hart.  While we remain cautious on the timing and extent of the replacement cycle, we have been encouraged by modest upticks in spending by many of our casino operator customers over the past two quarters.
Gaming Operations
 
Fourth quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $283.2 million and $170.2 million, respectively, compared to $331.0 million and $192.7 million for the same quarter last year.For the year ended September 30, 2009, revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $1.2 billion and $683.8 million, respectively, compared to $1.3 billion and $778.1 million in the prior year.   Revenues and gross profit decreased primarily due to lower play levels and continued shifts in installed base mix to include more lower-yielding, stand-alone lease machines.

For the current quarter and fiscal year, gross margins on gaming operations were 60% and 58% respectively, compared to 58% for both prior year periods.  The current quarter benefited from a larger base of fully depreciated units.
 
As of September 30, 2009, IGTs gaming operations installed base totaled 61,400 units, an increase of 300 units from the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of 900 units over the prior year.  Installed base growth in international markets was partially offset by a reduction in domestic placements.  As of September 30, 2009, approximately 85% of our installed base was comprised of variable fee games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.

Product Sales
 
 
Product sales revenues and gross profit in the fourth quarter declined 23% and 26%, respectively, while units shipped worldwide decreased 30% over the prior year quarter.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, product sales revenues and gross profit declined 21% and 27%, respectively, while units shipped worldwide decreased 25% over the prior year.  North America revenues decreased 31% for the quarter and 16% for the fiscal year, largely driven by fewer new openings and replacement sales.  International revenues declined 11% for the quarter and 31% for the fiscal year as international markets continue to feel the effects of the economic slowdown, most notably in Continental Europe, Japan and South America, and unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  Consolidated gross margin on product sales for the quarter was 51% compared to 54% in the prior year quarter, and 50% for the full year compared to 54% last year.  Both periods were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes spread across fixed manufacturing costs, as well as higher costs related to systems upgrades and fewer systems sales, which carry higher margins.

Deferred revenue increased approximately $48.8 million during the quarter to $122.0 million as of September 30, 2009, as a result of additional multi-element contracts.  As we continue to pursue our sales strategy, we may experience increasing levels of deferred revenues from multi-element contracts including systems software and machines bundled together.  Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers and include units for which revenues have been deferred.  Equivalent units recognized represents units recognized in revenues during the periods under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes units for which revenues were previously deferred.  We have included in the table above a reconciliation of units shipped to units recognized in revenue for each period presented.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
 
Fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $261.9 million, compared to $204.4 million in the prior year period.  Excluding a non-cash charge of $78.0 million associated with our investment in Walker Digital, restructuring charges of $5.2 million and bad debt expense of $9.0 million, operating expense would have been $169.7 million, a 16% decrease from the prior year quarter.  For the full year, operating expenses increased to $830.3 million, compared to $759.8 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the above mentioned non-cash charges, restructuring charges and higher bad debt provisions.
 
Other expense, net, in the fourth quarter totaled $34.8 million, a decrease of $12.0 million from the prior year period.  The decrease was mostly due to reduced investment write-downs, which included LVGI impairment of $13.3 million in the current quarter and less foreign exchange loss, partially offset by increased borrowing costs on our recent refinancings.  Other expense, net, for the full year increased $14.8 million to $83.3 million, driven primarily by additional interest expense, partially offset by reduced investment write-downs.

Cash Flows, Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, IGT generated$547.9 million in cash from operations on net income of $149.0 million compared to $486.5 million on net income of $342.5 million in the prior year.  Increases in year-over-year cash from operations were primarily the result of reductions in receivable and inventory balances and additional pre-payments for long-term licensing rights in the prior year.
 
 
Working capital decreased to $609.2 million at September 30, 2009 compared to $733.4 million at September 30, 2008.Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $247.4 million at September 30, 2009 versus $374.4 million at September 30, 2008.Debt totaled $2.2 billion at September 30, 2009 compared to $2.3 billion at September 30, 2008.  The available capacity on our $1.8 billion line of credit totaled $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2009.
 
 
 
Our 3.25% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the periods ended September 30, 2009, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.  The weighted average stock price during the fourth quarter and the period from issuance to September 30, 2009 was $19.62 and $18.18, respectively.

Impact of Share Price on Diluted Shares Outstanding from $850.0 Million 3.25% Convertible Notes
Issued May 11, 2009, Purchased Bond Hedges, and Sold Warrants
 
The table above demonstrates the estimated potential impact on the diluted share count used in calculating diluted earnings per share for IGTs 3.25% convertible notes and the related purchased note hedges and separate sold warrant transactions assuming certain stock price levels. The convertible notes and sold warrants were excluded from our diluted shares outstanding for the period ended September 30, 2009, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
 
GAAP dilution is calculated per GAAP requirements by reference to the amount by which our stock price exceeds the initial $19.97 conversion price of the convertible notes plus dilution from the sold warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrants exercise price of $30.14 and excludes the impact of the purchased note hedges which have an exercise price of $19.97, because the convertible note hedges are anti-dilutive.
(1)
 
Pro Forma dilution represents the estimated potential economic dilution including the anti-dilutive impact of the purchased note hedges.

The table above is for illustrative purposes only; IGT is unable to predict its future stock price and IGTs stock could trade below or above the closing price assumptions in the table.
