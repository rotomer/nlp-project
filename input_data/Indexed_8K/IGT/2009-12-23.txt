5.           .  Notwithstanding the provisions hereof, the post-termination payment and benefit provisions of the Executives written employment or other agreement with the Company or an Affiliate in force at the termination of the Executives Employment (if any) will apply in lieu of the provisions hereof if and to the extent that, with respect to the Executives termination of Employment, the provisions of such employment or other agreement would provide greater payments or benefits to the Executive (or to the Executives covered dependents or beneficiaries).

No Duty to Mitigate
 
9.           . The Board or the Compensation Committee may amend this Agreement, provided, however, that, no such action which would have the effect of reducing or diminishing the Executives entitlements under this Agreement shall be effective without the express written consent of the Executive.

In any such event, the term the Company, as used herein shall mean the Company, as defined in Section 2 hereof, and any such successor or assignee.
