Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT), announced today the filing of its fiscal 2010 second quarter 10-Q and is providing an update on the Alabama electronic charitable bingo market.
(Las Vegas, NV  May 13, 2010)
a global leader in creating the games players love and network systems that improve the player experience,
 
The legality of electronic charitable bingo in Alabama continues to be under challenge by the states Governor.  Since IGTs fiscal 2010 second quarter earnings press release on April 22, 2010, the legal and political climate in Alabama has further deteriorated, and therefore we have determined that the recoverability of our assets in this market has been impaired.  As a result, in the second quarter ended March 31, 2010, we recognized $53.1 million of impairment charges, including note allowances of $47.6 million, accounts receivable allowances of $2.8 million, and gaming operations equipment impairment of $2.7 million.  Additionally, second quarter revenues were reduced $3.3 million and interest income was reduced $0.3 million from the amounts included in our earnings press r elease on April 22, 2010, based on our assessment of collectability.
 
Our remaining net carrying amounts after the impairment recorded at March 31, 2010 totaled $38.5 million for development financing and accounts receivable extended to Alabama charitable bingo properties and $6.4 million for related gaming operations assets.
 
As a result of these charges, our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 have changed since our press release on April 22, 2010.  Net income in the second quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $0.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share.  Excluding the charges noted above and previously disclosed charges in our earnings press release, adjusted net income was $58.8 million or $0.20 per diluted share.  For a reconciliation of adjusted net income, please refer to the supplemental schedule at the end of this release.
