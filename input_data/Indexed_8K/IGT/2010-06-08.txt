9.
            
(a)
          
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.  The Company acknowledges that the information set forth on Schedule III hereto constitutes the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, severally and not jointly, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the
 
allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations (including any failure by the indemnified party to provide any notice specified above).  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of each Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter and to any affiliate of each Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act.
 
10.
          
If, at the Time of Delivery, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be
 
obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be agreed upon by the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date.  If, at the Time of Delivery, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party (other than a defaulting Underwriter) to any other party except that the provisions of Section 7, Section 9, this Section 10 and Section 18 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.  Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
11.
          
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.
          
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8(h) or 10 hereof, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to implement Section 5.3(a) on or before November 15, 2010; , that any failure to obtain any such regulatory approval shall not be a breach of this covenant or a Default or Event of Default hereunder so long as the Company has used its reasonable best efforts to do so.
provided
 
(c)
          
Any Lien granted pursuant to Section 5.3(a) shall be shared equally and ratably with the loans under the Credit Facility and with any other notes, bonds or debentures that may be issued by the Company following the date of this Second Supplemental Indenture, if the terms of such other notes, bonds or debentures so provide; that any such Lien shall be automatically released upon the release of the Lien granted pursuant to Section 5.3(a).

If the Company secures the 2020 Notes in this manner, the Company shall have the option of securing any of its other Indebtedness or obligations, or those of any Subsidiary, equally and ratably with the 2020 Notes, as long as such other debt or obligations are not subordinate to the 2020 Notes.

Section 5.5
            
Limitations on Sales and Leasebacks.
 
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable with respect to a sale and leaseback transaction unless after giving effect thereto the sum, without duplication, of (a) the aggregate principal amount of all secured Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than to the extent secured by a Permitted Lien) and (b) all Attributable Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of any sale and leaseback transactions (other than those referred to in the following two paragraphs) does not in the aggregate exceed 10% of the Company's Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

(v)
          
a default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any Indebtedness (other than the 2020 Notes) having an outstanding principal amount of $100,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent) or more, after the applicable grace period, that has caused the holders of the instruments evidencing such Indebtedness to declare such Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its stated maturity, unless such declaration has been rescinded within 30 days;

(vii)
        
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
 
(A)
         
commences a voluntary case;
 
(B)

(D)

The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
 
A Default under clause (iv) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes then Outstanding notify the Company (and in the case of such notice by Holders of 2020 Notes, the Trustee) of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default after receipt of such notice within the time specified.  Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "."
Notice of Default
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 daysafter the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Default and any Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or in the 2020 Notes to the contrary, at the election of the Company, the sole remedy of a Holder resulting from an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(iv) relating to the failure by the Company to comply with Section 5.3 of the Base Indenture or for any failure by the Company to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the TIA, shall for the first 60 daysafter the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive an extension fee (the "") on the 2020 Notes at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes.  This Extension Fee will accrue on the 2020 Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with Section 5.3 of the Base Indenture or for any failure by the Company to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the TIA first occurs to but not including the 60th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such obligations shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 7.4).  On such 60th day (or earlier, if such Event of Default is cured or waived pursuant to Section 7.4 prior to such 60th day), such Extension Fee will cease to accrue and, if such Event of Default has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 7.4 prior to such 60th day, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the 2020 Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all such 2020 Notes to be due and payable immediately.  This provision shall not affect the rights of Holders of 2020 Notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default.  If the Company elects to pay the Extension Fee as the sole remedy for an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(iv) relating to the failure by the Company to comply with Section 5.3 of the Base Indenture or the failure by the Company to comply with the
Extension Fee
 
requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the TIA, the Company shall notify, in the manner provided for in Section 9.2, the Holders of 2020 Notes and the Trustee of such election at any time on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default first occurs.  If the Extension Fee is payable under this Section 7.1, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to that effect stating the date on which such Extension Fee is payable.  Unless and until a Trust Officer receives at the Corporate Trust Office such an Officers' Certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Extension Fee is payable.  If the Extension Fee has been paid by the Company directly to the Persons entitled to them, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.
 
In the event that the Company is required to pay any Extension Fee pursuant to this Section 7.1, the Company shall provide a direction or order in the form of a written notice to the Trustee (and if the Trustee is not the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent) of the Company's obligation to pay
such Extension Fee
no later than three Business Days prior to date on which any such Extension Fee is scheduled to be paid.  Such notice shall set forth the amount of Extension Fee
to be paid by the Company on such payment date and direct the Trustee (or, if the Trustee is not the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent) to make payment to the extent it receives funds from the Company to do so.  The Trustee shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of 2020 Notes to determine whether Extension Fee is payable, or with respect to the nature, extent or calculation of the amount of Extension Fee owed, or with respect to the method employed in such calculation of Extension Fee.
 
Section 7.2
            
Acceleration.
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.1(vii) or 7.1(viii) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes then Outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of 2020 Notes Outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest on all the 2020 Notes to be immediately due and payable.  Upon such a declaration, such accelerated amount shall be due and payable immediately.
 
If an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.1(vii) or 7.1(viii) with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of 2020 Notes Outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest on all the 2020 Notes shall, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or any Holder of 2020 Notes, become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders of 2020 Notes.
 
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at the time Outstanding by notice to the Trustee and the Company and without notice to any other Holder of 2020 Notes may rescind any declaration of acceleration if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest that have become due solely as a result of acceleration.  No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
 
Section 7.3
            
Other Remedies.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the 2020 Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the 2020 Notes or this Indenture.
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the 2020 Notes or does not produce any of the 2020 Notes in the proceeding.  A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of 2020 Notes in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.  No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy.  All available remedies are cumulative.
 
Section 7.4
            
Waiver of Past Defaults.
 
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at the time Outstanding by notice to the Trustee and without notice to any other Holder of 2020 Notes may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (a) an Event of Default described in Section 7.1(i) or 7.1(ii) or (b) a default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.2 of the Base Indenture cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder of 2020 Notes.  When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any consequent right.
 
Section 7.5
            
Control by Majority.
 
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at the time Outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.1 of the Base Indenture, that the Trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of 2020 Notes or would potentially involve the Trustee in personal liability; , however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.  Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to reasonable indemnification against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
provided
 
Section 7.6
            
Limitation on Suits.
 
A Holder of 2020 Notes may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the 2020 Notes unless:
 
(a)
          
such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
 
(b)
          
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at the time Outstanding make a written request, and such Holder or Holders shall have offered reasonable indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee to pursue such proceeding as trustee; and
(c)
          
the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after such notice, request and offer of indemnity and, during such 60-day period, has not received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request.
 
A Holder of 2020 Notes may not use the Indenture to prejudice the rights of any other Holder of 2020 Notes or to obtain a preference or priority over any other Holder of 2020 Notes.
 
Section 7.7
            
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of 2020 Notes to receive payment of the principal amount, interest, Extension Fee, Redemption Price, or Change of Control Repurchase Price in respect of the 2020 Notes held by such Holder, on or after any Redemption Date, Change of Control Repurchase Date, or the respective due dates expressed in such Holder's 2020 Notes, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
