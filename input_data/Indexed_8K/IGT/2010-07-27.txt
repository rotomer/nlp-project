International Game Technology Reports 2010 Third Quarter Results
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2010.  Income from continuing operations for the quarter was$94.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share versus $62.2 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.  The current quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items of $36.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share, offset by restructuring charges of $2.7 million and debt refinancing costs of $4.0 million, collectively $0.01 per diluted share.  The favorable discrete tax items recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related t o the IRS audit closure for the fiscal years 2002 through 2005, partially offset by changes in our uncertain tax liabilities.  The prior year quarter included restructuring charges of $3.0 million and net debt refinancing charges of $6.2 million, collectively $0.02 per diluted share.  Excluding the items noted above, third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $61.9 million or $0.21 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and $67.4 million or $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2009.  A reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release.
(Las Vegas, NV  July 27, 2010)
 
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, income from continuing operations was $189.3 million or $0.63 per diluted share versus $159.6 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the first nine months last year.  Comparability for both the quarter and nine-month periods was affected by a number of items outlined in a supplemental reconciliation of adjusted income from continuing operations at the end of this release.  All prior periods presented included adjustments for the retrospective application of accounting standards adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2010, primarily related to the separation of liability and equity elements of our convertible debt.  The retrospective adjustments, outlined in a supplemental schedule at the end of this release, impacted interest expense, earnings per share, long-term debt, and shareholders equity.
 
Third quarter net income, including discontinued operations related to the closure of our Japan operations, totaled $92.1 million or $0.31 per diluted share versus $60.6 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.  For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, net income totaled $166.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share compared to $155.4 million or $0.53 per diluted share in the prior year period.
 
 
 
 
 
Our third quarter results reflect meaningful progress at IGT, said CEO Patti Hart.  Despite challenges in the broader marketplace, we continue to manage our business to increasing levels of efficiencies.  Our efforts have resulted in the generation of significant cash flow for reinvestment into the business in areas that create innovative and customer centric products and services.
Consolidated Operations
 
Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $489.7 million, of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and 44% from product sales, compared to $517.3 million for the same quarter last year.  For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the same period last year.  Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the third quarter were $275.9 million and $120.2 million, respectively, compared to $295.8 million and $127.0 million in the prior year quarter.  For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated gross profit and operating income were $844.2 million and $319.5 million, respectively, compared to $859.0 million and $301.1 million for the same period last year.
Gaming Operations
 
Third quarter revenues and gross profit from gaming operations totaled $276.6 million and $161.3 million, respectively, compared to $286.7 million and $178.3 million for the same quarter last year.Revenues decreased primarily due to a lower installed base and the continued shift toward lower-yielding machines.  For the current quarter, gross margins on gaming operations declined to 58% compared to 62% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to increased jackpot expense resulting from interest rate changes.  Interest rate change on jackpot liabilities increased jackpot expense by $6.2 million in this years third quarter and decreased jackpot expense by $3.4 million in the prior year quarter.
 
 
As of June 30, 2010, IGTs gaming operations installed base totaled 58,900 units, an increase of 100 units from the immediately preceding quarter and a decrease of 2,200 units over the prior year quarter.  North America decreases over the prior year, largely attributable to regulatory issues in Alabama, were partially offset by increases in international markets.  As of June 30, 2010, approximately 83% of our installed base was comprised of variable fee games, which earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.

Product Sales
 
 
Product sales revenues and gross profit in the third quarter decreased 8% and 2%, respectively, and units shipped worldwide decreased 29% over the prior year quarter.  North America revenues decreased 16% for the quarter, largely driven by fewer new openings.  International revenues increased 8% for the quarter, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange, as well as the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and improved sales in Mexico.  Consolidated gross margin on product sales for the quarter improved to 54% compared to 51% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to reduced material costs and an increased mix of higher-margin non-machine products.

Deferred revenue decreased $10.2 million during the quarter to $91.8 million at June 30, 2010.  The adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 resulted in the recognition of $7.9 million of revenues in the current quarter which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
 
Units shipped for the current and prior periods reflect all units shipped to customers and include units for which revenues have been deferred.  Equivalent units recognized represents units recognized in revenues during the periods under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes units for which revenues were previously deferred.  We have included in the table above a reconciliation of units shipped to units recognized in revenue for each period presented.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
 
Third quarter operating expenses decreased 8% to $155.7 million compared to $168.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to our cost reduction efforts.  Professional fees also decreased due to debt refinancing costs of $1.8 million included in the prior year quarter.
 
Other expense, net, in the third quarter decreased to $24.2 million compared to $26.0 million in the prior year quarter, largely attributable to foreign currency gains and reduced interest expense on lower borrowings.  Third quarter interest expense included debt refinancing charges of $4.0 million in the current third quarter and $4.4 million in the prior year quarter.  Our interest expense also included incremental non-cash charges of $6.8 million in the current quarter and $9.0 million in the prior year quarter, as a result of accounting guidance adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2010 that requires convertible debt interest to be calculated using a rate for similar non-convertible instruments.
Cash Flows, Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $423.8 million in cash from operations on net income of $166.1 million compared to $354.4 million on net income of $155.4 million for the first nine months last year.

Working capital decreased to $609.1 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $609.2 million at September 30, 2009.As of June 30, 2010, cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $251.9 million andcontractualdebt obligations totaled $1.9 billion, with $1.2 billion of available capacity on our $1.5 billion credit facility.
 
 
 
 
As previously announced, on June 3, 2010 IGT issued $300 million of 5.50% notes due June 2020.  The net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our domestic credit facility.  In conjunction with this note offering, we reduced the total size of our domestic credit facility from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion.
 
Our 3.25% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2010, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.

* The tax effect was calculated using a core tax rate, which is before discrete items and unique amounts not subject to current period tax, of 39.0% for the fiscal 2010 periods and 37.7% for fiscal 2009.
Adjusted income from continuing operations is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted income from continuing operations should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indicator of our operating performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  All companies do not calculate adjusted income from continuing operations in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Unaudited Supplemental Data (continued)
 
 
Adjusted EBITDA (earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income/expense, net, and other charges as noted in the table above) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
 
 
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our net cash from operations.  Net cash from operations is reduced by amounts expended for capital expenditures and dividends paid.  Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operations or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Unaudited Supplemental Data (continued)
 
Impact of Share Price on Diluted Share Count Used in Calculating Earnings Per Share from $850.0 Million 3.25% Convertible Notes Issued May 11, 2009, Purchased Bond Hedges, and Sold Warrants
 
 
The table above demonstrates the estimated potential impact on the diluted share count used in calculating diluted earnings per share for IGTs 3.25% convertible notes and the related purchased note hedges and separate sold warrant transactions assuming certain stock price levels. The convertible notes and sold warrants were excluded from our diluted shares outstanding for the periods ended June 30, 2010, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
 
GAAP dilution is calculated per GAAP requirements by reference to the amount by which our stock price exceeds the initial $19.97 conversion price of the convertible notes plus dilution from the sold warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrants exercise price of $30.14 and excludes the impact of the purchased note hedges which have an exercise price of $19.97, because the convertible note hedges are anti-dilutive.
(1)
 
Pro Forma dilution represents the estimated potential economic dilution including the anti-dilutive impact of the purchased note hedges.
(2)
 
The table above is for illustrative purposes only; IGT is unable to predict its future stock price and IGTs stock could trade below or above the closing price assumptions in the table.
