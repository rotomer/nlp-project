 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.

(LAS VEGAS  November 9, 2010)
 
In fiscal year 2010, we continued to have relatively strong financial performance in an economy that remains weakened.  More importantly, we set the company on a course to achieve greater financial and operational performance in the future.  We improved margins, generated more cash and improved our balance sheet versus last year, said CEO Patti Hart.  Moving forward, we plan to continue to improve on our metrics while increasing our emphasis on top-line growth, international expansion and leading the industry technologically as gaming transforms around the globe.
Fourth quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $53 million or $0.18 per share for fiscal 2010 and $54 million or $0.18 per share for fiscal 2009.  For the year ended September 30, 2010, adjusted income from continuing operations was $253 million or $0.85 per share and $223 million or $0.76 per share for fiscal 2009.  The current quarter was impacted by $0.09 per share, primarily related to non-cash charges of $21 million for investment losses due to changes in our agreements with China LotSynergy Holdings Limited and $11 million for impairment on Alabama and DigiDeal assets.  The prior year quarter included non-cash losses on investments and other assets of $78 million related to Walker Digital Gaming, Inc. and $13 mill ion related to Las Vegas Gaming International, as well as $5 million of restructuring charges, collectively $0.22 per share.  A reconciliation of our GAAP results to adjusted non-GAAP results is included in the supplemental schedules at the end of this press release.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, net income totaled $186 million or $0.62 per share compared to $127 million or $0.43 per share in fiscal 2009.
Consolidated Operations
 
Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $496 million, of which 54% was generated from gaming operations and 46% from product sales, compared to $512 million for the same quarter last year.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $2.0 billion compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year.  Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter was $277 million compared to $290 million in the prior year quarter.  Consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year was $1.1 billion for both 2010 and 2009.  Consolidated gross margins for the fourth quarter were 56%, down 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.  For the year ended September 30, 2010, consolidated gross margins increased 100 basis points to 56% compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to improved operational efficiencies in gaming operations.
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $103 million compared to $33 million in the prior year quarter.  For the year ended September 30, 2010, operating income was $433 million compared to $338 million in the prior year.  Operating income margin for the fourth quarter was 21% compared to 6% in the same quarter last year, largely due to lower impairment losses.  For fiscal year 2010 operating income margin improved 600 basis points to 22% compared to fiscal 2009, largely due to cost savings initiatives.  On an adjusted basis, operating income margin for fiscal 2010 was 25% compared to 23% last year.

Gaming Operations
Fourth quarter gaming operations revenues declined 5% to $268 million and fiscal year revenues declined 6% to $1.1 billion compared to the prior year periods.  Both periods declined primarily due to a lower installed base and the continued shift toward lower-yielding machines.
 
Fourth quarter gaming operations gross profit totaled $156 million compared to $170 million for the same quarter last year.For the year ended September 30, 2010, gross profit from gaming operations totaled $663 million compared to $679 million in the prior year.
 
 
For the current quarter, gross margins on gaming operations declined to 58% compared to 60% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to fixed costs spread over a smaller installed base.  For the year ended September 30, 2010, gross margins on gaming operations increased to 60% compared to 58% in the prior year, primarily due to lower operating costs, most significantly depreciation, jackpot expense and royalties.
 
As of September 30, 2010, IGTs gaming operations installed base totaled 57,000 units, a decrease of 1,800 units from the prior sequential quarter and 4,300 units over the prior year.  North America decreases, largely attributable to the closure of certain charitable bingo facilities in Alabama, were partially offset by increases internationally.  As of September 30, 2010, approximately 82% of our installed base was comprised of variable fee games, which earn a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee, compared to approximately 85% as of the end of fiscal 2009.
Product Sales
Fourth quarter revenues from product sales declined 1% to $228 million and for the year ended September 30, 2010, revenues declined 4% to $886 million compared to the same periods last year.  Both periods were affected by fewer new openings in North America, partially offset by improved sales internationally.  International revenues increased 14% for the quarter, primarily due to improved sales in South America, and 27% for the year, primarily due to higher unit volume.

Fourth quarter gross profit from product sales totaled $121 million, flat compared to the same quarter last year.For the year ended September 30, 2010, gross profit from product sales totaled $458 million compared to $470 million in the prior year.  Consolidated gross margin on product sales was 53% for the fourth quarter compared to 52% last year, and 52% for the full year compared to 51% in the prior year.
 
 
Deferred revenue decreased $2 million during the quarter to $90 million at September 30, 2010.  The adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 resulted in the recognition of $8 million in current quarter revenues which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
Fourth quarter operating expenses decreased to $174 million or 35% of revenues compared to $257 million or 50% of revenues in the prior year quarter.    For the full year, operating expenses decreased to $687 million or 35% of revenues compared to $810 million or 39% of revenues in fiscal 2009.  Quarterly adjusted operating expenses decreased slightly to $164 million from the prior year quarter.  For the full year, adjusted operating expenses decreased 7% to $615 million or 31% of revenues.  Adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses, as reconciled in a supplemental schedule at the end of this release, exclude non-cash impairment and losses on other assets, restructuring costs, and bad debt provisions.
 
Other expense, net, in the fourth quarter totaled $44 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter.  The decrease was attributable to reduced interest expense on lower borrowings, partially offset by increased investment losses.  Interest expense included incremental non-cash charges of $7 million in the current quarter and $12 million in the prior year quarter, as a result of accounting guidance adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2010 that requires convertible debt interest to be calculated using a rate for similar non-convertible instruments.  Other expense, net, for the full year totaled $120 million compared to $119 million in the prior year.

Impact of Share Price on Diluted Share Count Used in Calculating Earnings Per Share from $850.0 Million 3.25% Convertible Notes Issued May 11, 2009, Purchased Bond Hedges, and Sold Warrants
 
The table above demonstrates the estimated potential impact on the diluted share count used in calculating diluted earnings per share for IGTs 3.25% convertible notes and the related purchased note hedges and separate sold warrant transactions assuming certain stock price levels. The convertible notes and sold warrants were excluded from our diluted shares outstanding for the periods ended September 30, 2010, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
 
GAAP dilution is calculated per GAAP requirements by reference to the amount by which our stock price exceeds the initial $19.97 conversion price of the convertible notes plus dilution from the sold warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrants exercise price of $30.14 and excludes the impact of the purchased note hedges which have an exercise price of $19.97, because the convertible note hedges are anti-dilutive.
(1)
 
Pro Forma dilution represents the estimated potential economic dilution including the anti-dilutive impact of the purchased note hedges.
(2)
The table above is for illustrative purposes only; IGT is unable to predict its future stock price and IGTs stock could trade below or above the closing price assumptions in the table.
