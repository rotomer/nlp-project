 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) announced today operating results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2010.  Income from continuing operations for the quarter was$73 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $75 million, or $0.26 per share, in the same quarter last yearThis quarters earnings were favorably impacted by $0.04 per share from certain discrete tax benefits and gain on the sale of our equity investment in China LotSynergy Holdings, Ltd. (CLS), as set forth in a supplemental schedule attached to this release.
(LAS VEGAS  Jan. 20, 2011)
 
.  
Our first quarter results are reflective of our focus on improving our profitability and processes.  While consistent top-line growth remains challenging, our internal cost cutting and operational improvement strategies are solidly taking hold, said CEO Patti Hart.  Based on early customer feedback, we are confident that our recently released games are gaining momentum.  We look forward to better demonstrating our top-line focused initiatives in the second half of this year and beyond.
Consolidated Operations
Consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $465 million, of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and 44% from product sales, compared to $515 million for the same quarter last year.  Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $276 million and $121 million, respectively, compared to $296 million and $144 million, in the prior year first quarter.  Consolidated revenues decreased primarily due to fewer international openings and expansions in the quarter versus last year.

Gaming Operations
 
First quarter revenues from gaming operations totaled $261 million compared to $277 million for the same quarter last year.Revenues decreased primarily due to a reduced installed base.  Average revenue per unit in the first quarter was $50.38, a decrease of $0.48 per day from the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of $1.13 year over year.  The year over year increase was mainly due to fewer lower-yielding units.
 
 
Gaming operations gross profit totaled $165 million in the first quarter, down 5% year over year.  For the current quarter, gross margins on gaming operations were 63%, compared to 62% for the same quarter last year.  Margins for this years quarter were positively impacted by the removal of lower yielding charitable bingo games in Alabama.
 
At the end of the quarter, IGTs gaming operations installed base totaled 56,700 units, a decrease of 300 units from the immediately preceding quarter and 5,400 units from the prior year first quarter primarily due to the closure of certain charitable bingo facilities in Alabama (4,900 units) and the conversion of leased games to for-sale units in Mexico (1,000 units).
Product Sales
 
First quarter product sales revenues were $204 million, down 14% from $238 million a year ago.  Globally, the company recognized 9,400 units in the quarter, down from 11,900 for the corresponding quarter of last year, primarily due to fewer new shipments in both International and North America regions.
 
Gross profit in the first quarter declined 9% to $112 million while gross margin improved nearly 300 bps to 55%.  The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a stronger mix of non-machine sales and an improved geographic mix.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
 
First quarter operating expenses increased to $155 million compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher research and development expenses, partially offset by lower bad debt and depreciation expense.

Adjusted EBITDA (income/loss from continuing operations before interest and other non-operating income/expense-net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, and other charges noted in the reconciliation) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance wit h GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).  All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
 
 
 
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our operating cash flows. Net operating cash flows are reduced by capital expenditures and/or dividends paid. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net operating cash flows or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Unaudited Supplemental Data (continued)
 
Impact of Share Price on Diluted Share Count Used in Calculating Earnings Per Share from $850.0 Million 3.25% Convertible Notes Issued May 11, 2009, Purchased Bond Hedges, and Sold Warrants
 
 
The table above demonstrates the estimated potential impact on the diluted share count used in calculating diluted Earnings per share for IGT's 3.25% convertible notes and the related purchased note hedges and separate sold warrant transactions assuming certain stock price levels. The convertible notes and sold warrants were excluded from our diluted shares outstanding for the period ended December 31, 2010, because the conversion price and exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
 
GAAP dilution is calculated per GAAP requirements by reference to the amount by which our stock price exceeds the initial $19.97 conversion price of the convertible notes plus dilution from the sold warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrants' exercise price of $30.14 and excludes the impact of the purchased note hedges which have an exercise price of $19.97, because the convertible note hedges are anti-dilutive.
(1)
Pro Forma dilution represents the estimated potential economic dilution including the anti-dilutive impact of the purchased note hedges.
(2)
 
The table above is for illustrative purposes only; IGT is unable to predict its future stock price and IGT's stock could trade below or above the closing price assumptions in the table.
