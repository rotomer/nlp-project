The New Credit Facility replaces the $1.24 billion unsecured Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as June 8, 2009, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd./Union Bank of California, N.A., and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents, and Banc of America Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and RBS Securities, Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, and a syndicate of other lenders (the Prior Credit Facility).  The Prior Credit Facility, which was scheduled to mature on June 8, 2012, was terminated with the execution of the New Credit Facility without the incurrence of any early termination penalties or fees.
The New Credit Facility provides a revolving credit line of $750 million; the Company may request that the facility be increased to $1.0 billion, which increase is at the discretion of the Lenders.   The revolving credit line is available for direct borrowings and up to $100.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit.  In addition, a portion of the commitments under the New Credit Facility, not exceeding $50.0 million, is available for direct borrowings under a swing line from Bank of America N.A., in its capacity as the swing line lender.  The facility is unsecured and matures on April 14, 2016 at which time all amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable.
As of April 14, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. The interest rates and facility fees applicable to the New Credit Facility are based on the Companys debt ratings or the Companys Net Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio as more specifically provided in the New Credit Facility.  Initially, the applicable interest rate is LIBOR plus 122.5 basis points, and the applicable facility fee is 27.5 basis points.
 
The New Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain the following financial covenants:
 
 
The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the Companys ability to, among other things:

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
