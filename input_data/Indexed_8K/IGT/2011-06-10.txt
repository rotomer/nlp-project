Explanatory Note
This Amendment No. 1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by International Game Technology (the Company) on March 4, 2011 (the Original 8-K) updates disclosures made under Item 5.07, Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders, regarding the results of the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 1, 2011 (the 2011 Annual Meeting).  The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose the decision of the Board of Directors (the Board) regarding how frequently it will conduct non-binding advisory votes on the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers.  No other changes have been made to the Original 8-K.
Item 5.07                      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
As previously reported, in a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers held at the 2011 Annual Meeting, 182,450,226 shares voted for every one year, 591,998 shares voted for every two years, 32,415,024 shares voted for every three years, and there were 1,977,478 abstentions and 35,169,729 broker non-votes.
Accordingly, in light of these voting results and other factors considered by the Board, the Board has determined that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers until the next non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of such votes, which will be no later than the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2017.
