Total revenues for the third quarter increased 3% to $489 million, of which 55% was generated from gaming operations and 45% from product sales, compared to $475 million for the same quarter last year.
 
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $289 million compared to $268 million in the prior years third quarter, due to improved product sales volume.
 
Operating income for the third quarter was $141 million, an increase of 17%, compared to $120 million in last years third quarter, due to higher revenues, lower cost of sales and flat operating expenses.
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2011, total revenues decreased 2% to $1.42 billion, gross profit improved 2% to $841 million and operating income increased 19% to $389 million.
Gaming Operations

Gaming operations gross profit improved to $165 million and gross margin to 62% in the third quarter compared to $156 million and 58%, respectively, in the prior years quarter. Margins for this years quarter were impacted positively by improved game performance and lower jackpot expenses.

Product Sales
Third quarter product sales revenues were $222 million, up 8% from $206 million a year ago. Globally, the company recognized 8,900 units in the quarter, up 7% from last years third quarter, primarily due to increases in domestic replacement and Latin America sales and down 2% sequentially, primarily due to fewer new openings domestically. The company recognized 9% and 5% more units in North America and International, respectively, year over year for the third quarter. Domestic average selling prices increased 2% compared to last years third quarter due to a higher percentage of new cabinets, specifically, the Universal Slant and G23 MLD products.  International average selling prices increased 16% compared to last years third quarter primarily due to favorable geographical and product mix, particularly in Europe and Australia, and favorable foreign exchange rates.
 
Product sales gross profit in the third quarter increased 10% to $124 million and gross margin improved 100 bps to 56% compared to last years third quarter. The increase in gross margin was driven by increased higher-margin international machine sales.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
Third quarter operating expenses of $148 million were essentially flat compared to the prior year third quarter. SG&A totaled 17% of revenues, and was also flat compared to last years third quarter, as lower bad debt provisions offset higher variable compensation expenses.
 
Other expense, net, in the third quarter decreased to $19 million compared to $24 million in the prior years quarter, primarily due to lower interest expense on reduced borrowings.
Cash Flows, Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment
For the first nine months of fiscal 2011, IGT generated$449 million in cash from operations compared to $424 million in the prior year period.
 
 
Working capital increased to $781 million at June 30, 2011 compared to $620 million at September 30, 2010.Cash equivalents and short-term investments (inclusive of restricted amounts) totaled $401 million andcontractualdebt obligations totaled $1.65 billion at June 30, 2011.
