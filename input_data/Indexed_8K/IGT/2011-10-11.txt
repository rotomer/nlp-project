IGT WINS BONUSING PATENT CASE AGAINST BALLY
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) has won an important appellate case against Bally Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BYI). On Oct. 6, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a district courts judgment against Bally for infringement of two of IGTs patents.
(LAS VEGAS  Oct. 11, 2011)
 
IGTs patents (U.S. Patent Nos. RE37,885 and RE38,812) claim certain methods of paying bonuses at gaming machines. Two of Ballys products, Power Rewards and ACSC Power Winners, were found to infringe. The case will now return to district court for a determination of damages and remedy.
IGT is very pleased with this decision, said Robert C. Melendres, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary of IGT.
