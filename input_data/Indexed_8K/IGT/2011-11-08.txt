Consolidated Operations
Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $540 million, of which 52% was generated from gaming operations and 48% from product sales, compared to $474 million for the same quarter last year, mainly due to increases in North America product sales and International gaming operations.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, total revenues were $1.96 billion compared to $1.92 billion in the prior year, primarily due to higher machine sales in North America.
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter increased 11% to $298 million compared to $267 million in the prior years fourth quarter, due to improved product sales volume.  Consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year was $1.14 billion for 2011 compared to $1.09 billion for 2010.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $116 million, an increase of 18%, compared to $98 million in last years fourth quarter, primarily due to higher revenues.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, operating income increased 19% to $505 million compared to $425 million in the prior year, due to higher revenues combined with gross margin expansion and lower impairment and restructuring expense.
Gaming Operations
Fourth quarter revenues from gaming operations increased 8% to $283 million compared to $261 million in the prior year mostly due to improved WAP performance, growth in the International install base and increased interactive revenue with the acquisition of Entraction Holding AB. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, total gaming operations revenue was $1.07 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Average revenue per unit per day in the fourth quarter was $58.08, up 9% over the prior year quarter on performance improvements in our MegaJackpots brand globally and International lease operations.

Gaming operations gross profit improved 6% to $160 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million for the same quarter last year, primarily from International lease operations and interactive.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, gaming operations gross profit was $651 million compared to $643 million in the prior year.  Increases in domestic and International lease operations and interactive were partially offset by lower domestic MegaJackpots revenues.
Gaming operations gross margin declined to 57% in the fourth quarter compared to 58% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to an intellectual property litigation settlement of $5 million.  Additionally, increased jackpot funding costs due to unfavorable interest rate changes reduced gaming operations gross margin by 80 basis points.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, gaming operations gross margins were 61% compared to 60% in the prior year, due to yield improvements attributable to the success of new game titles and an installed base shift toward higher margin units.
As of September 30, 2011, IGTs gaming operations installed base totaled 53,900 units, an increase of 1,000 over the prior year and an increase of 600 units from the immediately preceding quarter primarily due to additions in International operations.
Product Sales
Fourth quarter product sales revenues were $257 million, up 20% and for the year ended September 30, 2011, revenues were $884 million, up 5% compared to the same periods last year mainly driven by North America machine sales. Globally, the company recognized 11,300 units in the quarter, up 38% from last years fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in domestic replacement units. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, the company recognized 37,500 units, an increase of 8% over the prior year, due to an increase in domestic replacement units.
Domestic average selling price was flat in the fourth quarter and declined 1% for the fiscal year due to fluctuations in product mix compared to the same periods last year. International average selling prices increased 4% and 1% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, respectively, compared to the same periods last year, due to favorable foreign exchange rates.

Additional Guidance Disclosure
In this release, we provide guidance on adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the 2012 fiscal year.  At this time, we have not identified any specific adjustments to GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the 2012 fiscal year.  Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of GAAP EPS from continuing operations to adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the 2012 fiscal year.  Adjustments to EPS from continuing operations are typically non-recurring or non-operating in nature.  For historical examples of these adjustments, please refer to the reconciliation table of GAAP EPS from continuing operations to adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 included in this release.
Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal year is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be construed as an alternative to EPS from continuing operations as an indicator of our operating performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  All companies do not calculate adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the same manner, and IGTs presentation may not be comparable to that of other companies.  The guidance provided in this release is as of November 8, 2011, and IGT undertakes no duty to update this guidance.
