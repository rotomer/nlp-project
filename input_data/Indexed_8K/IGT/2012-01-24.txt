International Game Technology Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
First Quarter Summary and Highlights (compared to last year)
 
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2011. GAAP income from continuing operations for the quarter was$50 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $73 million, or $0.25 per share, in the same quarter last year. The prior years quarter was favorably impacted by $0.04 per share from certain discrete tax benefits and an investment gain. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $50 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $62 million, or $0.21 per share, in the same quarter last year.
(LAS VEGAS  Jan. 24, 2012)
 
 
Our first quarter results  generating $100 million of operating income and over $160 million of Adjusted EBITDA  demonstrate the diversity we have built into our global business model and into our profitability.  Our international business and gaming operations business continue to show strength and our cost controls remain tight, said Patti Hart, CEO of IGT. We anticipate revenues and profit margins strengthening throughout the year and we remain on track to meet our fiscal year 2012 operating goals.
Adjusted income from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.  GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided at the end of this release.
Consolidated Operations
 
Total revenues for the first quarter were $446 million, of which 59% was generated from gaming operations and 41% from product sales, compared to $451 million for the same quarter last year.  The lower revenue was mainly due to fewer new casino openings in North America.  Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $252 million and $100 million, respectively, compared to $269 million and $120 million, respectively, in the prior years first quarter.  The decreases were primarily due to lower North America machine, part, and conversion sales.

Gaming Operations
 
First quarter revenues from gaming operations increased 5% to $265 million compared to $253 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to increases in interactive, International lease operations and North America MegaJackpots. Average revenue per unit per day in the first quarter was $53.11, up 1% over the prior year quarter.  Sequentially, average revenue per unit decreased 9% primarily due to a higher mix of lower-yielding units.
 
Gaming operations gross profit totaled $160 million in the first quarter compared to $159 million for the same quarter last year.  Gaming operations gross margin was 61% in the first quarter compared to 63% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to unfavorable interest rate changes on jackpot expense.
 
As of December 31, 2011, IGTs gaming operations install base grew to 55,600 units, up 3,000 over the prior year and 1,700 units from September 30, 2011.  Increases in the install base were driven by an increase in North America lease operations, from the opening of Resorts World Casino New York City, and International lease operations in Latin America.
Product Sales
 
First quarter product sales revenues were $181 million, down 9% compared to the same quarter last year.  The company recognized 7,300 units in the quarter, down 12% from last years first quarter, primarily due to fewer new casino openings in North America.
 
Domestic average selling price increased 5% to $15,600 in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to a higher mix of Universal Slant and G23 MLD sales. International average selling prices increased 20% to $16,200 for the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the prior years conversion of lower-priced Mexico lease units to for-sale units.

Gross profit in the first quarter decreased to $92 million compared to $111 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower North America machine, part, and conversion sales.  Gross margin for the first quarter was 51% compared to 56% for the same quarter last year.  The decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from a less favorable product mix.
Operating Expenses and Other Income/Expense
 
First quarter operating expenses increased to $152 million, or 34% of revenues compared to $149 million, or 33% of revenues in the prior year quarter.  The increase was due to higher SG&A expenses, largely from the acquisition of Entraction, which was offset by lower depreciation and amortization, research and development and bad debt expense.
 
Other expense, net, in the first quarter totaled $21 million compared to $18 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to the prior year investment gain.
Cash Flows, Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, IGT generated $65 million in cash from operations on net income of $49 million compared to $102 million in cash from operations on net income of $74 million in the prior year period.
 
Working capital increased to $926 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $875 million at September 30, 2011.As of December 31, 2011, cash equivalents and short-term investments (including restricted amounts) totaled $587 million andcontractualdebt obligations totaled $1.65 billion.  As of December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under the companys credit facility.
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter, the company repurchased 0.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $16.74 per share for a total cost of $4 million.  Since the share repurchase program was announced on June 8, 2011, the company has repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.83 per share for a total cost of $54 million.

Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted Measures
(In millions, except EPS)
 
Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations are both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures commonly used by management and industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted income from continuing operations should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be construed as an alternative to EPS from continuing operations, as indicators of our operating performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  All companies do not calculate adjusted income from continuing operations or adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the same manner, and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to that of other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA (income/loss from continuing operations before interest and other non-operating income/expense-net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, and other charges noted in the reconciliation) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing gaming companies in several areas of liquidity, operating performance, valuation and leverage.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as an indicator of our operating performance) or net cash from operations (as a measure of liquidity) as determined in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).  All companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.
 
 
 
Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and commonly used by industry analysts to evaluate the discretionary amount of our operating cash flows.  Net operating cash flows are reduced by capital expenditures and/or dividends paid.  Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net operating cash flows or other cash flow measurements determined in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).  All companies do not calculate free cash flow in the same manner and IGT's presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

Additional Guidance Disclosure
 
In this release, we provide guidance on adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the 2012 fiscal year.  At this time, we have not identified any specific adjustments to GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the 2012 fiscal year.

Adjustments to EPS from continuing operations are typically non-recurring or non-operating in nature.  For historical examples of these adjustments, please refer to the reconciliation table of GAAP EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
