International Game Technology Reports Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
Third Quarter Highlights (compared to last years third quarter)
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2012.
(LAS VEGAS  Jul. 24, 2012)
Our third quarter revenue growth and strong cash flows are reflective of our diverse business model.  Against the backdrop of an inconsistent global economic recovery, we are generally pleased with this quarters results and remain on track to meet our fiscal year 2012 financial goals, said Patti Hart, CEO of IGT. The recent announcement of our $1 billion share repurchase is further evidence of our confidence in the outlook for IGT.

Outlook
Based on current expectations and the operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the company is reiterating its fiscal year 2012 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.98 to $1.04 per share. This guidance assumes our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 291 million for fiscal 2012. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2012 will include acquisition-related expenses, the amount of which are not determinable at this time, and may also include charges for impairment, acquisition-related expenses, resolution of certain tax items, and/or other items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant. For this reason, the Company is unable to provide full-year GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations estimates at this time.
