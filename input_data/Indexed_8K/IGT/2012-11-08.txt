Fiscal 2012 Highlights (compared to last year)
 International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2012.
(LAS VEGAS  Nov. 8, 2012)
Our strong fourth quarter financial results serve to highlight a very solid fiscal year 2012 for IGT.  In the quarter, we leveraged our industry-leading content to increase revenues, ship share, margins and prices in our core North American business, said Patti Hart, CEO of IGT. For the full year, we increased total revenues by 10%, improved adjusted earnings per share by 12%, improved global machine shipments by 23%, and more than tripled our interactive revenues.  We continue to effectively manage the distribution of our products to a diverse set of customers and we are well positioned to continue generating even greater revenues and earnings growth in fiscal year 2013.  Hart continued, Fiscal 2012 marked our third consecutive year of double-digit growth in earnings per share from continuing operations, which underscores our success in growing our core business, while pursuing other value-enhancing opportunities.  IGT is pleased to have returned nearly $550 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2012, and we remain focused on delivering superior returns for our shareholders going forward.

Other

The fourth quarter was also impacted by a $15 million reorganization charge related to IGTi operations involving the closure of Entraction services and facilities.

Outlook
 
Based on current expectations, the company is offering its initial fiscal year 2013 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.20 to $1.30 per share.  GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2013 will include acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to Double Down, the amount of which are not determinable at this time.  The company may also recognize charges for impairment, other acquisition-related expenses, resolution of certain tax items, and/or other items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant. For this reason, the Company is unable to provide full-year GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations estimates at this time.
