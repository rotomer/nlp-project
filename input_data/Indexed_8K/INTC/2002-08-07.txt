I, Craig R. Barrett, state and attest that:
     (1)  To the best of my knowledge, based upon a review of the covered reports of Intel Corporation,             and, except as corrected or supplemented in a subsequent covered report:
no covered report contained an untrue statement of a material fact as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed); and   
no covered report omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed).
     (2)  I have reviewed the contents of this statement with the Company's audit committee.
     (3)  In this statement under oath, each of the following, if filed on or before the date of this            statement, is a "covered report":
