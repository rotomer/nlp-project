Exhibit 99.1 Intel First Quarter Revenue $8.1 Billion; Earnings Per Share of 26 Cents Includes Impact of Approximately 1.7 Cents from Intergraph Agreement SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 13, 2004--Intel Corporation today announced first quarter revenue of $8.1 billion, down 7 percent sequentially and up 20 percent year-over-year. First quarter net income was $1.7 billion, down 20 percent sequentially and up 89 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share were 26 cents, down 21 percent sequentially and up 86 percent from 14 cents in the first quarter of 2003. "Intel's first quarter results showed healthy growth in both revenue and earnings compared to a year ago, led by improvement in worldwide IT spending," said Craig R. Barrett, Intel chief executive officer. "We ramped our 90 nm process into high volume with the launch of several new desktop processors, and plan to substantially increase shipments in the second quarter including our first mobile and server products. The combination of these products plus new processors and platform innovations coming over the course of this year positions us well for continued growth." On March 30, Intel and Intergraph Corporation announced a settlement agreement that resolves all of the remaining issues in a patent infringement case and provides certain rights for Intel customers. Under the agreement, Intel will pay $225 million to Intergraph. Intel recorded a $162-million charge to first quarter cost of sales, which reduced earnings per share by approximately 1.7 cents. The remaining $63 million represents the value of intellectual property assets, which will be amortized over approximately five years. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be completed after April 13, 2004. -- Revenue in the second quarter is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $8.2 billion. -- Gross margin percentage in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. Intel's gross margin percentage varies primarily with revenue levels, product mix and pricing, changes in unit costs and inventory valuation, capacity utilization, and the timing of factory ramps and associated costs. -- The gross margin percentage expectation for 2004 is unchanged at approximately 62 percent, plus or minus a few points. -- Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the second quarter are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, higher than $2.34 billion in the first quarter primarily due to annual wage increases that took effect on April 1. Expenses, particularly certain marketing- and compensation-related expenses, vary depending on the level of revenue and profits. -- The R&D spending expectation for 2004 is unchanged at approximately $4.8 billion. -- The capital spending expectation for 2004 is unchanged at between $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion. -- Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the second quarter are expected to be approximately $60 million. -- The tax rate expectation for 2004 is unchanged at approximately 32 percent. The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected income, and assumes Intel will continue to receive tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures, the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. -- Depreciation is expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in the second quarter and approximately $4.6 billion for the year. -- Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is expected to be approximately $40 million in the second quarter and approximately $170 million for the full year. The statements in this document that refer to plans and expectations for the second quarter, the year and the future are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A number of factors in addition to those discussed above could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Demand for Intel's products, which impacts revenue and the gross margin percentage, is affected by business and economic conditions, as well as computing and communications industry trends, and changes in customer order patterns. Intel conducts much of its manufacturing, assembly and test, and sales activities outside the United States and is thus subject to a number of other factors, including currency controls and fluctuations, tariff and import regulations, and regulatory requirements which may limit Intel's or its customers' ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop or sell products in particular countries. If terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the United States, Israel or other locations, such events may disrupt manufacturing, assembly and test, logistics, security and communications, and could also result in reduced demand for Intel's products. The impacts of major health concerns, or of large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers, on Intel, its suppliers, customers or other third parties could also adversely affect Intel's business and impact customer order patterns. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies, competing software-compatible microprocessors, pricing pressures and other competitive factors, as well as market acceptance of Intel's new products, availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand, availability of externally purchased components or materials, and the development and timing of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of Intel's products. Future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement, including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products, as well as the timing of new product introductions, sustaining and growing new businesses and integrating and operating any acquired businesses. The gross margin percentage could also be affected by the execution of the manufacturing ramp, including the ramp of 90 nm process technology on 300 mm wafers, excess manufacturing capacity, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets. The expectation regarding gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other assumes no unanticipated events and varies depending on equity market levels and volatility, gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, impairment charges related to non-marketable and other investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Expectations of impairment charges on investments are based on experience, and it is not possible to know which specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments. Results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications), and by litigation involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer and other issues, such as the litigation described in Intel's SEC reports, as well as other risk factors listed in Intel's SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2003. Status of Business Outlook and Mid-Quarter Business Update During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts, the media and others. Intel intends to publish a Mid-Quarter Business Update on June 3. From the close of business on May 28 until publication of the Update, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q should be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the company. For more information about the Business Outlook, Update and related Quiet Periods, please refer to the Business Outlook section of Intel's Web site at www.intc.com. FIRST QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS Financial Review -- The gross margin percentage for the first quarter was 60.2 percent, including the settlement agreement-related charge which impacted the gross margin percentage by two points. The gross margin percentage was lower than 63.6 percent in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of the settlement agreement along with lower revenue. Key Product Trends (Sequential) -- Intel Architecture microprocessor units were lower. The average selling price was slightly higher. The average selling price excluding Xbox(a) processors was approximately flat. -- Chipset units were lower. -- Motherboard units were lower. -- Flash memory units were higher. Flash revenue information is available in the supplemental financial information table that accompanies this release. -- Connectivity product units were lower.
