Item Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; 5.03 Change in Fiscal Year On September 8, 2004, the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment and restatement to the Company's Bylaws, which revised a number of provisions for general updating purposes. The title of "Chief Executive Officer" was added to lists throughout the Bylaws referring to senior executives authorized to take certain actions, and replaced the title of "President" as the officer granted certain authority along with the Chairman of the Board. Several revisions were made throughout the Bylaws and, in particular, in Articles IV and V, to clarify the tenure and duties of Board-elected and other appointed officers. Article IV was also revised to incorporate temporary officer succession provisions for use in the event of a specified officer being kidnapped, missing, dead, deemed by his or her manager to be incapacitated and unable to appropriately perform his or her duties, or in any other case where such officer vacates his or her office, in the absence of any alternative resolutions on temporary succession which may be adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time. The temporary officer succession provisions in the Bylaws are consistent with and supersede a previously adopted Board resolution addressing officer succession. Several other miscellaneous provisions were revised to properly reflect current practices of the Company and the Board. For example, Article II, Section 8 of the former Bylaws, which allowed stockholder action by written consent if not otherwise prohibited, was deleted, as the Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides that the stockholders may only act at meetings and may not act by written consent. Conforming changes were made throughout the bylaws to remove references to actions by the stockholders by written consent. In addition, Article III regarding Directors was revised to delete the provision requiring a meeting of the Board to be held immediately after the annual stockholders' meeting; to allow the Chief Executive Officer, in addition to the Chairman of the Board or any two directors, to call special meetings of the Board of Directors; and to delete the reference to per-meeting fees in the section on Board compensation.

(b) The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that stockholder meetings shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.
Section 2. Annual Meetings. The annual meetings of the stockholders of the corporation for the purpose of election of directors, and for such other business as may lawfully come before them, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, but in no event more than fifteen (15) months after the date of the preceding annual meeting. Section 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors at any time. Section 4. Notice of Meetings. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice (as the term "written" is defined in Article XII hereof) of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article X hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). (b) If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. (c) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (d) Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.
(e) Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. Section 5. Quorum and Voting. (a) At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares, the voting of which at said meeting have been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at said meeting. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation. Section 6. Voting Rights. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two (2) or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one (1) of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum. (b) Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Section 7. List of Stockholders. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Section 8. Nominations and Stockholder Business. (a) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 9, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and such business must be a proper subject for stockholder action under the Delaware General Corporation Law. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement) not less than forty-five (45) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed (other than as a result of adjournment) by more than thirty (30) days from the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owners if any on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. (d) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the stockholder's notice required by this section shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement) not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.
(e) Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this section, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded. (f) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 9, 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. ARTICLE III Directors Section 1. Number and Term of Office. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole of the Board of Directors shall be eleven (11).

Elected directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders.

Section 2. Powers. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Section 3. Vacancies. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office for the unexpired
portion of the term of the director whose place shall be vacant, and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this section in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any director, or if the stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 4 below) to elect the number of directors then constituting the whole Board. Section 4. Resignations and Removals. (a) Any director may resign at any time by delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. When one (1) or more directors shall resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose place shall be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. (b) Except as provided in Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, at a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose in the manner hereinabove provided, the Board of Directors, or any individual director, may be removed from office, with or without cause, and a new director or directors elected by a vote of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Section 5. Meetings. a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may also be held at any place within or without the State of Delaware which has been designated by resolutions of the Board of Directors or the written consent of all directors. Notice of regular meetings of the directors is hereby dispensed with and no notice whatever of any such meetings need be given.

(c) Written notice of the time and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be delivered to each director at least twenty-four (24) hours before the start of the meeting, or if sent by first class mail, at least seventy-two (72) hours before the start of the meeting. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing
at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat. Section 6. Quorum and Voting. (a) A quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a majority of the exact number of directors fixed from time to time in accordance with Section 1 of Article III of these Bylaws, but not less than one (1); provided, however, at any meeting whether a quorum be present or otherwise, a majority of the directors present may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors, without notice other than by announcement at the meeting. (b) At each meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present, all questions and business shall be determined by a vote of a majority of the directors present, unless a different vote be required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. (c) Any member of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone or other communication equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. (d) The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or noticed, or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present shall deliver to the corporation a written waiver of notice, or a consent to holding such meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Section 7. Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and such writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form or shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. Section 8. Fees and Compensation. Directors may receive compensation for their services as directors as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.
Section 9. Committees. (a) Executive Committee: The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive Committee of not less than one (1) member, each of whom shall be a director. The Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by Delaware law, these Bylaws, the Executive Committee Charter or other resolutions of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise, when the Board of Directors is not in session, all powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, including, without limitation, the power and authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock, except such committee shall not have the power or authority to (a) approve or adopt, or recommend to the corporation's stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (b) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the corporation. (b) Other Committees: The Board of Directors may appoint such other committees as may be permitted by law. Such other committees appointed by the Board of Directors shall have such powers and perform such duties as may be prescribed by the resolution or resolutions creating such committee, but in no event shall any such committee have the powers denied to the Executive Committee in these Bylaws. (c) Term: The members of all committees of the Board of Directors shall serve a term coexistent with that of the Board of Directors which shall have appointed such committee. The Board, subject to the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Section 9, may at any time increase or decrease the number of members of a committee or terminate the existence of a committee; provided that no committee shall consist of less than one (1) member. The membership of a committee member shall terminate on the date of his death or voluntary resignation, but the Board may at any time for any reason remove any individual committee member and the Board may fill any committee vacancy created by death, resignation, removal or increase in the number of members of the committee. The Board of Directors may designate one (1) or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee, and, in addition, in the absence or disqualification of any member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not the member or members constitutes a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. (d) Meetings: Unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise provide, regular meetings of the Executive Committee or any other committee appointed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be held at such times and places as are determined by the Board of Directors, or by any such committee, and when notice thereof has been given to each member of such committee, no further notice of such regular meetings need be given thereafter; special meetings of any such committee may be called by any director who is a member of such committee, upon written notice to the members of
such committee of the time and place of such special meeting given in the manner provided for the giving of written notice to members of the Board of Directors of the time and place of special meetings of the Board of Directors. Notice of any special meeting of any committee may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat. A majority of the authorized number of members of any such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee. Section 10. Emeritus Director. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, elect one (1) or more Emeritus Directors, each of whom shall serve, at the pleasure of the Board, until the first meeting of the Board next following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and for a maximum period of three (3) years, subject to an annual review, or until earlier resignation or removal by the Board (except that founders of the company may remain as Emeritus Directors, subject to the annual review, or until earlier resignation or removal by the Board). Emeritus Directors shall serve as advisors and consultants to the Board of Directors and may be appointed by the Board to serve as advisors and consultants to committees of the Board. Emeritus Directors may be invited to attend meetings of the Board or any committee of the Board for which they have been appointed to serve as advisors and consultants and, if present, may participate in the discussions occurring during such meetings. Emeritus Directors shall not be permitted to vote on matters brought before the Board or any committee thereof and shall not be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum of the Board or the committee is present. Emeritus Directors shall receive no fee for their services as Emeritus Directors. Emeritus Directors will not be entitled to receive reimbursement for expenses of meeting attendance, except as approved by the Chairman of the Board. Emeritus Directors may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors. Section 11: Emergency Bylaws. In the event of any emergency, disaster or catastrophe, as referred to in Section 110 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or other similar emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board of Directors or a standing committee of the Board cannot readily be convened for action, then the director or directors in attendance at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. Such director or directors in attendance may further take action to appoint one (1) or more of themselves or other directors to membership on any standing or temporary committees of the Board as they shall deem necessary and appropriate. ARTICLE IV Officers Section 1. Officers Designated. (a) The officers of the corporation elected by the Board of Directors shall be a Chairman of the Board of Directors, who shall be a member of the Board of Directors, a Chief Executive Officer, a President, one (1) or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary, a Chief Financial Officer and a Treasurer and such other officers as the Board
of Directors may deem expedient, and such officers shall be elected in such manner and hold their offices for such terms as the Board of Directors may prescribe. The Board of Directors may assign such additional titles to one (1) or more of the officers as they shall deem appropriate. Any one (1) person may hold any number of offices of the corporation at any one time unless specifically prohibited therefrom by law. The Board of Directors may from time to time, in its discretion, assign titles, powers, duties and reporting arrangements for any elected officer. Any office of the corporation may be left vacant from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The salaries and other compensation of the officers of the corporation shall be fixed by or in the manner designated by the Board of Directors.

Any Appointed Officer may be appointed by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may from time to time, in his or her discretion, assign powers, duties, scope of job responsibilities and reporting arrangements for any Appointed Officer.

Tenure, Succession and Duties of Officers. (a) Tenure: All officers shall hold office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors and until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified, unless sooner removed. Any officer elected by the Board of Directors may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors. If the office of any elected officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be left vacant or be filled by the Board of Directors. Any Appointed Officer may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer. If the office of any Appointed Officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be left vacant or be filled by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be construed as creating any kind of contractual right to employment with the corporation. (b) Succession: In the absence of a resolution of the Board of Directors specifying another order of succession, in cases where a corporate officer, as listed below, shall be kidnapped, missing, dead, deemed by his or her manager to be incapacitated and unable to appropriately perform his or her duties, or in any other case where such officer vacates his or her office (individually a "Corporate Absence") such corporate officer's powers and duties shall be performed as follows: (i) Succession of the Chairman of the Board: In any case of Corporate Absence with regard to the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors shall meet promptly to consider whether to confer the title, powers and duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors on another member of the Board of Directors.

If the corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

Section 5. Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VII Other Securities of the Corporation All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates, may be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or any Vice President or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.

Any corporate instrument or document requiring the corporate seal may be executed as provided in Article V of these Bylaws, and the corporate seal shall be applied by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary. ARTICLE IX Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Employees and Agents Section 1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (as a party, witness, or otherwise), in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation (including service with respect to employee benefit plans) or is or was serving at the request of the corporation
as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent (hereafter an "Agent"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto) against all expenses, liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed on any Agent as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any Proceeding (hereinafter "Expenses"); provided, however, that except as to actions to enforce indemnification rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Article, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right. Section 2. Authority to Advance Expenses. Expenses incurred by an officer or director (acting in his capacity as such) in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, provided, however, that if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, such Expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article or otherwise. Expenses incurred by other Agents of the corporation (or by the directors or officers not acting in their capacity as such, including service with respect to employee benefit plans) may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. Any obligation to reimburse the corporation for Expense advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon. Section 3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit, in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of Delaware, against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Section 4. Provisions Nonexclusive. The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. To the extent that any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, or vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws, the provision, agreement, or vote shall take precedence. Section 5. Authority to Insure. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Agent against any Expense, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the Agent against such Expense under applicable law or the provisions of this Article. Section 6. Survival of Rights. The rights provided by this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Section 7. Settlement of Claims. The corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any Agent under this Article (a) for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporation's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) for any judicial award if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action. Section 8. Effect of Amendment. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any Agent existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or modification. Section 9. Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Agent, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Section 10. No Duplication of Payments. The corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. ARTICLE X Notices (a) Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. (b) Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method hereinabove stated. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one (1) permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. (c) If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and the time at which such notice was directed to each
such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained. (d) All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to directors by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the corporation. (e) The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice. (f) Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing given by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. (g) Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. (h) Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation. If delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's
notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement. ARTICLE XI Amendments Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be repealed, altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted at any meeting of the stockholders, either annual or special, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock entitled to vote at such meeting. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to repeal, alter or amend these Bylaws or adopt new Bylaws (including, without limitation, the amendment of any Bylaws setting forth the number of directors who shall constitute the whole Board of Directors) by unanimous written consent or at any annual, regular, or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such Bylaws and provided that the Board of Directors shall not make or alter any Bylaws fixing the qualifications, classifications, term of office or compensation of directors. ARTICLE XII Electronic Transmission When used in these Bylaws, the terms "written" and "in writing" shall include any "electronic transmission," as defined in Section 232(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including without limitation any telegram, cablegram, facsimile transmission and communication by electronic mail.
