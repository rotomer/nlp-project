These plans relate to the sale of stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of Intel stock options that were previously granted in April 1995 and April 1996, which expire in April 2005 and April 2006, respectively. Mr. Otellini entered into two separate 10b5-1 trading plans.

The transactions will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
