Exhibit 99.1 Intel First-Quarter Revenue $9.4 Billion; Earnings Per Share 34 Cents SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2005--Intel Corporation today announced first-quarter revenue of $9.4 billion, up 17 percent year-over-year and down 2 percent sequentially. First-quarter net income was $2.2 billion, up 25 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent sequentially. Earnings per share were 34 cents, up 31 percent from 26 cents in the first quarter of 2004 and up 3 percent from 33 cents in the fourth quarter of 2004. Intel's first quarter included an additional week of business because 2005 is a 53-week fiscal year for the company. Last year's first-quarter results included a legal settlement charge that reduced earnings per share by 1.7 cents. "Led by strong demand for our mobile products, Intel posted double-digit revenue and profit growth versus a year ago," said Intel CEO Craig Barrett. "Today marks the 40th anniversary of Moore's Law, which remains the driving force behind our ability to continually innovate and bring exciting new products to our customers around the world. In the coming quarters we expect to carry on the pace set over past decades by ramping our industry-leading 65nm process technology and launching additional dual-core microprocessors for our desktop, notebook and server platforms." During the quarter, Intel announced a broad reorganization bringing all major product groups in line with the company's strategy to develop and deliver complete technology platforms based on Intel ingredients. Intel's goal is to change its operating segment presentation to reflect the company's new organizational structure beginning with its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005. The Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group will be reportable segments under the new structure, while the Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group and Channel Platforms Group are expected to be included in the "all other" category. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Please see the Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a description of certain important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, and refer to Intel's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of the risks. These statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be completed after April 18, 2005. -- Revenue in the second quarter is expected to be between $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion. -- Gross margin percentage for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, as compared to 59.3 percent in the first quarter. The gross margin percentage expectation for 2005 is now 59 percent, plus or minus a few points, as compared to the previous expectation of 58 percent, plus or minus a few points. The gross margin percentage could vary from expectations based on changes in revenue levels, product mix and pricing, manufacturing yields, changes in unit costs, variations in inventory valuation, excess or obsolete inventory, capacity utilization and the existence of excess capacity, impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets, and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up costs. -- Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the second quarter are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion. Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, could vary from expectations depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the level of revenue and profits. -- The R&D spending expectation for 2005 is unchanged at approximately $5.2 billion. -- Capital spending for 2005 is now expected to be between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion, higher than the previous expectation of between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, driven primarily by stronger than anticipated business and increased confidence in the company's 65nm process technology ramp. -- Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the second quarter are expected to be approximately $70 million. -- The tax rate for the second, third and fourth quarters is currently expected to be approximately 31 percent. This expectation does not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act. The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures, the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. -- Depreciation for the second quarter is expected to be $1.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million. The depreciation expectation for the full year is unchanged at $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million. -- Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter and approximately $125 million for the full year. FIRST-QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS Financial Review -- The gross margin percentage was 59.3 percent, higher than the revised expectation of 57 percent, plus or minus a point, primarily due to better than anticipated microprocessor mix and costs along with earlier than anticipated shipment qualification of certain new products. -- Intel used $2.5 billion in cash to repurchase 107.9 million shares of its common stock during the quarter under an ongoing program. -- The company paid a cash dividend of 8 cents per share on March 1 to stockholders of record on February 7. The company's board of directors last year approved a doubling of the company's quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share. Key Product Trends (Sequential) -- Total microprocessor units and the average selling price were approximately flat. Mobile microprocessor units set a record. -- Chipset units were lower. -- Motherboard units were lower. -- Flash memory units were lower. -- Wireless connectivity units set a record. -- Wired connectivity units were lower. Digital Enterprise Group For servers, Intel introduced a new line of 64-bit Intel(R) Xeon(TM) MP processors, which support servers with four or more processors, along with a new four-processor platform for mid-tier servers.
