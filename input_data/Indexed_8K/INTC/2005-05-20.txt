Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement (a) On May 18, 2005, Intel's stockholders approved amendments to the Intel Corporation 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the "Plan") to: (1) extend the term of the plan to June 30, 2007, (2) reserve an additional 130 million shares of Intel common stock for issuance under the plan, of which up to two million shares may be awarded under options with a 10 year term, (3) allow grants of restricted stock or stock units to Intel's non-employee directors, (4) allow the use of up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares for employee recognition awards having no minimum vesting period, and (5) clarify the company's share-counting methodology under the plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and stock units to eligible full-time and part-time employees and non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee determines which employees will participate in the Plan, as well as the terms of employee grants, and the Board determines the terms of grants to non-employee directors. An aggregate of 370 million shares have been reserved for issuance as awards over the term of the Plan, which expires on June 30, 2007, subject to adjustment only to reflect stock splits and similar events. Stock options granted under the Plan may not have a term longer than seven years, except that up to 10 million shares may be used for long- term executive retention stock option grants having a term no longer than 10 years. No more than 35 million shares may be issued as restricted stock or stock unit awards under the Plan. The Plan limits awards to any employee participant in any single calendar year to no more than 3 million shares subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and no more than 2 million shares subject to restricted stock or stock unit awards. No more than 30,000 shares may be subject to awards granted to any non-employee director in a single calendar year. Awards under the Plan may be conditioned on continued employment, the passage of time or the satisfaction of performance vesting criteria established by award on the date of grant. Vesting requirements are determined by the Compensation Committee, provided, however, that stock options and stock appreciation rights shall not first become exercisable in less than one year and restricted stock or stock units shall not vest in less than pro rata installments over three years, unless vesting is based on the achievement of performance criteria, in which case such performance vesting criteria may not be based on a period of less than one year. Up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares may be issued under the Plan as employee recognition stock awards having no minimum vesting period.
The Plan prohibits grants of stock options or stock appreciation rights at a price below the market value of Intel stock on the date of grant. The Plan also prohibits repricing of stock options without shareholder consent, and prohibits reload stock option grants. Shares not issued due to cancellation, expiration or forfeiture of an award or due to settlement of an award in cash do not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. The foregoing summary description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. For additional information regarding the Plan, refer to Proposal 3 (Approval of Amendment and Extension of the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan) on pages 31-38 of the company's 2005 Proxy Statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. (b) On May 18, 2005, Intel's stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Executive Officer Incentive Plan ("EOIP"). The EOIP, in which the company's executive officers participate, is a cash-based, pay-for-performance incentive program. Payments under the EOIP are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), and are tax-deductible. Stockholder approval of the material terms of the EOIP, including the employees eligible to receive compensation under the plan, a description of the business criteria on which the performance goal is based and the maximum amount of compensation that could be paid to any employee under the plan (or the formula used to calculate the amount of compensation to be paid to the employee), satisfies one of the requirements under Code Section 162(m) in order for payments pursuant to the plan to be tax- deductible. Executive officers, as determined by the Compensation Committee, are eligible to participate in the EOIP. The EOIP includes a formula to calculate the maximum annual incentive payout for each executive officer. The EOIP incentive formula has three variables: (1) the executive officer's annual incentive baseline amount, which the Committee determines annually for each participant, (2) Intel's earnings per share for the year ("EPS"), and (3) a factor pre- established each year by the Committee (the "Performance Factor"). At the end of the year, Intel multiplies the individual's incentive baseline amount by Intel's EPS and the Performance Factor to calculate the maximum EOIP incentive for that year. The EOIP has a cap limiting each individual's incentive payment to a maximum annual amount of $5,000,000. Under the EOIP, the Committee has the discretion to reduce, but not increase, a participant's incentive payment. The EOIP does not specify the
criteria that the Committee must use in exercising its discretion to reduce the incentive payment and it also does not require the Committee to make any reductions. For purposes of the EOIP formula, EPS is the greater of (x) Intel's operating income, or (y) Intel's net income divided by Intel's weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution. The Committee may adjust Intel's operating income or its net income based on objective criteria selected by the Committee in its sole discretion and in compliance with IRS regulations. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, asset write-downs, litigation, claim judgments, settlements or tax settlements, the effects of tax law changes, changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs, gains or losses on investments, acquisition- related costs, and any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion of financial condition and results of operations appearing in Intel's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year. Operating income does not include gains or losses on equity securities or interest and other income Intel earned, and does not include a deduction for interest expense and income taxes. As a result, EPS based on operating income generally exceeds EPS based on net income. The EOIP as approved by stockholders also reflects a number of amendments designed to clarify the Compensation Committee's authority under the EOIP and to address the terms and conditions of executive officers' participation. The foregoing description of the EOIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2. For additional information about the EOIP, refer to Proposal 4 (Approval of Amendment and Extension of the Executive Officer Incentive Plan) on pages 38-41 of the company's 2005 Proxy Statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year On February 1, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a temporary decrease to the number of authorized directors from 11 to 10, effective May 18, 2005. This temporary decrease is necessary as Andrew S. Grove did not stand for reelection to the Board of Directors at the Annual Stockholders' Meeting held May 18, 2005, and the Board has not to date chosen a candidate to fill the seat being vacated by Dr. Grove. The Board
expects to identify and appoint a new director at some time in 2005 following the Annual Stockholders' Meeting and the Board presently expects that the new director will be independent. Intel will make a public announcement if and when a new director is appointed. Therefore, effective as of May 18, 2005, Article III, Section 1 of the Bylaws was amended to provide that the authorized number of directors is 10. On May 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to Intel's Bylaws to provide that all classes and series of stock, including those presently outstanding, shall hereafter be represented by uncertificated shares only, except to the extent as may be required by applicable law or as otherwise authorized by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. Therefore, effective as of May 17, 2005, Article VI, Section 1 of the Bylaws was amended to provide that certificates for the shares of stock of the corporation will be issued only to the extent as may be required by applicable law or as otherwise authorized by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. Several revisions were made throughout this section to conform references to share certificates to such certificates issued only to the extent as may be required by applicable law or as otherwise authorized by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. The change to the company's Bylaws regarding uncertificated shares adapts to changes in Delaware law, which will be effective August 1, 2005. As a general matter, the company intends in the future to evidence its outstanding stock in book entry (uncertificated) form to the extent permitted by law in lieu of issuing paper stock certificates. Article VI, Section 2 of the Bylaws was amended to authorize the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary (in addition to the Board of Directors) to handle the replacement of lost stock certificates. In addition, Article VI, Section 3 of the Bylaws was amended to provide that transfers of record of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by attorney duly authorized, and with regard to certificated shares, upon the surrender of a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares, properly endorsed.

ARTICLE II Stockholders' Meetings Section 1. Place of Meetings. (a) Meetings of the stockholders of the corporation shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, or, if not so designated, then at the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. (b) The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that stockholder meetings shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.
Section 2. Annual Meetings. The annual meetings of the stockholders of the corporation for the purpose of election of directors, and for such other business as may lawfully come before them, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, but in no event more than fifteen (15) months after the date of the preceding annual meeting. Section 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors at any time. Section 4. Notice of Meetings. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice (as the term "written" is defined in Article XII hereof) of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article X hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). (b) If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section. (c) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. (d) Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.
(e) Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given. Section 5. Quorum and Voting. (a) At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares, the voting of which at said meeting have been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at said meeting. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation. Section 6. Voting Rights. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two (2) or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one (1) of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum. (b) Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Section 7. List of Stockholders. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Section 8. Nominations and Stockholder Business. (a) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to this section, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation, and such business must be a proper subject for stockholder action under the Delaware General Corporation Law. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement) not less than forty-five (45) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed (other than as a result of adjournment) by more than thirty (30) days from the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owners if any on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public announcement specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this section shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. (d) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the stockholder's notice required by this section shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement) not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.
(e) Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this section, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded. (f) For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 9, 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. ARTICLE III Directors Section 1. Number and Term of Office. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole of the Board of Directors shall be ten (10). With the exception of the first Board of Directors, which shall be elected by the incorporator, and except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, the directors shall be elected by a plurality vote of the shares represented in person or by proxy, at the stockholders annual meeting in each year and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Elected directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. If, for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws. Section 2. Powers. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Section 3. Vacancies. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office for the unexpired
portion of the term of the director whose place shall be vacant, and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this section in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any director, or if the stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 4 below) to elect the number of directors then constituting the whole Board. Section 4. Resignations and Removals. (a) Any director may resign at any time by delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. When one (1) or more directors shall resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose place shall be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. (b) Except as provided in Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, at a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose in the manner hereinabove provided, the Board of Directors, or any individual director, may be removed from office, with or without cause, and a new director or directors elected by a vote of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Section 5. Meetings. (a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may also be held at any place within or without the State of Delaware which has been designated by resolutions of the Board of Directors or the written consent of all directors. Notice of regular meetings of the directors is hereby dispensed with and no notice whatever of any such meetings need be given. (b) Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time and place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, or by the Chief Executive Officer (if a director) or by any two of the directors. (c) Written notice of the time and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be delivered to each director at least twenty-four (24) hours before the start of the meeting, or if sent by first class mail, at least seventy-two (72) hours before the start of the meeting. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat.
Section 6. Quorum and Voting. (a) A quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a majority of the exact number of directors fixed from time to time in accordance with Section 1 of Article III of these Bylaws, but not less than one (1); provided, however, at any meeting whether a quorum be present or otherwise, a majority of the directors present may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors, without notice other than by announcement at the meeting. (b) At each meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present, all questions and business shall be determined by a vote of a majority of the directors present, unless a different vote be required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. (c) Any member of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone or other communication equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. (d) The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or noticed, or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present shall deliver to the corporation a written waiver of notice, or a consent to holding such meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Section 7. Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and such writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form or shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. Section 8. Fees and Compensation. Directors may receive compensation for their services as directors as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor. Section 9. Committees. (a) Executive Committee: The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive Committee of not less than one (1) member, each of whom shall be a director. The Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by Delaware law, these Bylaws, the Executive Committee Charter or other resolutions of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise, when the Board of Directors is not in session, all powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary may, in its or their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to indemnify the corporation in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a surety bond in such form and amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost or destroyed.

If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. Section 5. Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize
any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VII Other Securities of the Corporation All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates, may be signed by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or any Vice President or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon, shall have ceased to be such officer of the corporation before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation. ARTICLE VIII Corporate Seal The corporation shall have a common seal, upon which shall be inscribed: "Intel Corporation Incorporated March 1, 1989 Delaware" In the event the corporation changes its name, the corporate seal shall be changed to reflect such new name. Any corporate instrument or document requiring the corporate seal may be executed as provided in Article V of these Bylaws, and the corporate seal shall be applied by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary.
ARTICLE IX Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Employees and Agents Section 1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (as a party, witness, or otherwise), in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation (including service with respect to employee benefit plans) or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent (hereafter an "Agent"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto) against all expenses, liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed on any Agent as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any Proceeding (hereinafter "Expenses"); provided, however, that except as to actions to enforce indemnification rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Article, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right. Section 2. Authority to Advance Expenses. Expenses incurred by an officer or director (acting in his capacity as such) in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, provided, however, that if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, such Expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article or otherwise. Expenses incurred by other Agents of the corporation (or by the directors or officers not acting in their capacity as such, including service with respect to employee benefit plans) may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. Any obligation to reimburse
the corporation for Expense advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon. Section 3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit, in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of Delaware, against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Section 4. Provisions Nonexclusive. The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. To the extent that any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, or vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws, the provision, agreement, or vote shall take precedence. Section 5. Authority to Insure. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Agent against any Expense, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the Agent against such Expense under applicable law or the provisions of this Article. Section 6. Survival of Rights. The rights provided by this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Section 7. Settlement of Claims. The corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any Agent under this Article (a) for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporation's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) for any judicial award if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.
Section 8. Effect of Amendment. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any Agent existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or modification. Section 9. Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Agent, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Section 10. No Duplication of Payments. The corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. ARTICLE X Notices (a) Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. (b) Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method hereinabove stated. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one (1) permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
(c) If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and the time at which such notice was directed to each such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained. (d) All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to directors by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the corporation. (e) The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice. (f) Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing given by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. (g) Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In
the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. (h) Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation. If delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the company's most recent proxy statement. ARTICLE XI Amendments Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be repealed, altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted at any meeting of the stockholders, either annual or special, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock entitled to vote at such meeting. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to repeal, alter or amend these Bylaws or adopt new Bylaws (including, without limitation, the amendment of any Bylaws setting forth the number of directors who shall constitute the whole Board of Directors) by unanimous written consent or at any annual, regular, or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such Bylaws and provided that the Board of Directors shall not make or alter any Bylaws fixing the qualifications, classifications, term of office or compensation of directors.

(e) Determinations of the Committee. All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Committee regarding this Plan shall be final and binding on all Participants. The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems relevant to making such decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any director, officer or employee of the Corporation and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select. A Participant or other holder of an Award may contest a decision or action by the Committee with respect to such person or Award only on the grounds that such decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful, and any review of such decision or action shall be limited to determining whether the Committee's decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful. 4. PARTICIPANTS Awards under the Plan may be granted to any person who is an employee or Outside Director of the Corporation. Outside Directors may be granted Awards only pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan. The status of the Chairman of the Board of Directors as an employee or Outside Director shall be determined by the Committee. Any person designated by the Corporation as an independent contractor shall not be treated as an employee and shall not be eligible for Awards under the Plan. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE AND EXPIRATION OF PLAN (a) Effective Date. This Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on February 20, 2004 and became effective on May 19, 2004. (b) Expiration Date. The Plan shall remain available for the grant of Awards until June 30, 2007 or such earlier date as the Board of Directors may determine. The expiration of the Committee's authority to grant Awards under the Plan will not affect the operation of the terms of the Plan or the Corporation's and Participants' rights and obligations with respect to Awards granted on or prior to the expiration date of the Plan. 6. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN (a) Aggregate Limits. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11, the aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance as Awards under the Plan is 370,000,000, of which no more than an aggregate of 35,000,000 Shares may be issued as restricted stock or stock units and no more than an aggregate of 10,000,000 Shares shall be available for issuance as stock options under any program providing for stock option grants that vest in full in five or more years and that have a maximum term of ten years. The Shares subject to the Plan may be either Shares reacquired by the Corporation, including Shares purchased in the open market, or authorized but unissued Shares. Any Shares subject to an Award which for any reason expires or terminates unexercised or is not earned in full may again be made subject to an Award under the Plan. The following Shares may not again be made available for issuance as Awards under the Plan: (i) Shares not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right, (ii) Shares used to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes related to an outstanding Award, or (iii) Shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of the option exercise price.
(b) Tax Code Limits. The aggregate number of Shares subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights granted under this Plan during any calendar year to any one Participant shall not exceed 3,000,000. The aggregate number of Shares subject to restricted stock or stock unit Awards granted under this Plan during any calendar year to any one Participant shall not exceed 2,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the foregoing limitations shall be subject to adjustment under Section 11, but only to the extent that such adjustment will not affect the status of any Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. The aggregate number of Shares issued pursuant to incentive stock options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 370,000,000, which limitation shall be subject to adjustment under Section 11 only to the extent that such adjustment is consistent with adjustments permitted of a plan authorizing incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code. 7. PLAN AWARDS (a) Award Types. The Committee, on behalf of the Corporation, is authorized under this Plan to grant, award and enter into the following arrangements or benefits under the Plan provided that their terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units. Such arrangements and benefits are sometimes referred to herein as "Awards." The Committee, in its discretion, may determine that any Award granted hereunder shall be a Performance Award. (i)Stock Options. A "Stock Option" is a right to purchase a number of Shares at such exercise price, at such times, and on such other terms and conditions as are specified in or determined pursuant to the document(s) evidencing the Award (the "Option Agreement"). The Committee may grant Stock Options intended to be eligible to qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs") pursuant to Section 422 of the Code and Stock Options that are not intended to qualify as ISOs ("Non-qualified Stock Options"), as it, in its sole discretion, shall determine. (ii) Stock Appreciation Rights. A "Stock Appreciation Right" or "SAR" is a right to receive, in cash or stock (as determined by the Committee), value with respect to a specific number of Shares equal to or otherwise based on the excess of (i) the market value of a Share at the time of exercise over (ii) the exercise price of the right, subject to such terms and conditions as are expressed in the document(s) evidencing the Award (the "SAR Agreement"). (iii) Restricted Stock. A "Restricted Stock" Award is an award of Shares, the grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of which is subject to such conditions as are expressed in the document(s) evidencing the Award (the "Restricted Stock Agreement").
(iv) Stock Unit. A "Stock Unit" Award is an award of a right to receive, in cash or stock (as determined by the Committee) the market value of one Share, the grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of which is subject to such conditions as are expressed in the document(s) evidencing the Award (the "Stock Unit Agreement"). (b) Grants of Awards. An Award may consist of one of the foregoing arrangements or benefits or two or more of them in tandem or in the alternative. 8. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT AWARDS (a) Grant, Terms and Conditions of Stock Options and SARs The Committee may grant Stock Options or SARs at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the Plan to eligible employee Participants selected by the Committee. No Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to Stock Options or SARs hereunder until said Shares have been issued. Each Stock Option or SAR shall be evidenced only by such agreements, notices and/or terms or conditions documented in such form (including by electronic communications) as may be approved by the Committee. Each Stock Option grant will expressly identify the Stock Option as an ISO or as a Non-qualified Stock Option. Stock Options or SARs granted pursuant to the Plan need not be identical but each must contain or be subject to the following terms and conditions: (i)Price. The purchase price (also referred to as the exercise price) under each Stock Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be established by the Committee. The purchase price per Share shall not be less than 100% of the market value of a Share on the date of grant. For purposes of the Plan, "market value" shall mean the average of the high and low sales prices of the Corporation's common stock. The exercise price of a Stock Option shall be paid in cash or in such other form if and to the extent permitted by the Committee, including without limitation by delivery of already owned Shares, withholding (either actually or by attestation) of Shares otherwise issuable under such Stock Option and/or by payment under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program acceptable to the Committee. (ii) No Repricing. Other than in connection with a change in the Corporation's capitalization (as described in Section 11 of the Plan), the exercise price of a Stock Option or SAR may not be reduced without stockholder approval. (iii) No Reload Grants. Stock Options shall not be granted under the Plan in consideration for and shall not be conditioned upon the delivery of Shares to the Corporation in payment of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligation under any other employee stock option.
(iv) Duration, Exercise and Termination of Stock Options and SARs. Each Stock Option or SAR shall be exercisable at such time and in such installments during the period prior to the expiration of the Stock Option or SAR as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to make the timing of the ability to exercise any Stock Option or SAR subject to continued employment, the passage of time and/or such performance requirements as deemed appropriate by the Committee. At any time after the grant of a Stock Option, the Committee may reduce or eliminate any restrictions on the Participant's right to exercise all or part of the Stock Option, except that no Stock Option shall first become exercisable within one (1) year from its date of grant, other than upon the death, disability or retirement of the person to whom the Stock Option was granted, in each case as specified in the Option Agreement. Each Stock Option or SAR that vests in full in less than five (5) years (standard grants) must expire within a period of not more than seven (7) years from the grant date and each Stock Option or SAR that vests in full in five (5) or more years (long-term retention grants) must expire within a period of not more than ten (10) years from the grant date. In each case, the Option Agreement or SAR Agreement may provide for expiration prior to the end of the stated term of the Award in the event of the termination of employment or service of the Participant to whom it was granted. (v)Suspension or Termination of Stock Options and SARs. If at any time (including after a notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee, including any Subcommittee or administrator authorized pursuant to Section 3(b) (any such person, an "Authorized Officer"), reasonably believes that a Participant, other than an Outside Director, has committed an act of misconduct as described in this Section, the Authorized Officer may suspend the Participant's right to exercise any Stock Option or SAR pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Committee or an Authorized Officer determines a Participant, other than an Outside Director, has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to Intel, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, or if a Participant makes an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, engages in any conduct constituting unfair competition, induces any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or induces any principal for whom Intel acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship, neither the Participant nor his or her estate shall be entitled to exercise any Stock Option or SAR whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. For any Participant who is an "executive officer" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the determination of the Committee or of the Authorized Officer shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.
(vi) Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Stock Options or SARs. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee may provide that the Shares issued upon exercise of a Stock Option or SAR shall be subject to such further conditions or agreements as the Committee in its discretion may specify prior to the exercise of such Stock Option or SAR, including, without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions. The obligation to make payments with respect to SARs may be satisfied through cash payments or the delivery of Shares, or a combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may establish rules for the deferred delivery of Common Stock upon exercise of a Stock Option or SAR with the deferral evidenced by use of "Stock Units" equal in number to the number of Shares whose delivery is so deferred. (vii) Other Terms and Conditions. Stock Options and SARs may also contain such other provisions, which shall not be inconsistent with any of the foregoing terms, as the Committee shall deem appropriate. (viii) ISOs. Stock Options intending to qualify as ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation within the meaning of the Code, as determined by the Committee. No ISO shall be granted to any person if immediately after the grant of such Award, such person would own stock, including stock subject to outstanding Awards held by him or her under the Plan or any other plan established by the Corporation, amounting to more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Corporation. To the extent that the Option Agreement specifies that a Stock Option is intended to be treated as an ISO, the Stock Option is intended to qualify to the greatest extent possible as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and shall be so construed; provided, however, that any such designation shall not be interpreted as a representation, guarantee or other undertaking on the part of the Corporation that the Stock Option is or will be determined to qualify as an ISO. If and to the extent that any Shares are issued under a portion of any Stock Option that exceeds the $100,000 limitation of Section 422 of the Code, such Shares shall not be treated as issued under an ISO notwithstanding any designation otherwise. Certain decisions, amendments, interpretations and actions by the Committee and certain actions by a Participant may cause a Stock Option to cease to qualify as an ISO pursuant to the Code and by accepting a Stock Option the Participant agrees in advance to such disqualifying action. (b) Grant, Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock and Stock Units The Committee may grant Restricted Stock or Stock Units at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the Plan to eligible employee Participants selected by the Committee. A Participant shall have rights as a stockholder with respect to any
Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award hereunder only to the extent specified in this Plan or the Restricted Stock Agreement evidencing such Award. Awards of Restricted Stock or Stock Units shall be evidenced only by such agreements, notices and/or terms or conditions documented in such form (including by electronic communications) as may be approved by the Committee. Awards of Restricted Stock or Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan need not be identical but each must contain or be subject to the following terms and conditions: (i)Terms and Conditions. Each Restricted Stock Agreement and each Stock Unit Agreement shall contain provisions regarding (a) the number of Shares subject to such Award or a formula for determining such, (b) the purchase price of the Shares, if any, and the means of payment for the Shares, (c) the performance criteria, if any, and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the number of Shares granted, issued, retainable and/or vested, (d) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting and/or forfeiture of the Shares as may be determined from time to time by the Committee, (e) restrictions on the transferability of the Shares and (f) such further terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Committee, in each case not inconsistent with this Plan. (ii) Sale Price. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Committee shall determine the price, if any, at which Shares of Restricted Stock or Stock Units shall be sold or awarded to a Participant, which may vary from time to time and among Participants and which may be below the market value of such Shares at the date of grant or issuance. (iii) Share Vesting. The grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of Shares under Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards shall be at such time and in such installments as determined by the Committee or under criteria established by the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to make the timing of the grant and/or the issuance, ability to retain and/or vesting of Shares under Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards subject to continued employment, passage of time and/or such performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria as deemed appropriate by the Committee, which criteria may be based on financial performance and/or personal performance evaluations. Up to 100,000 Shares shall be available for issuance to employee Participants as Awards having no minimum vesting period. No condition that is based on performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria shall be based on performance over a period of less than one year, and no condition that is based upon continued employment or the passage of time shall provide for vesting in full of a Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award in less than pro rata installments over three years from the date the Award is made, other than with respect to such Awards that are issued upon exercise or settlement of Stock Options or SARs or upon the death, disability or retirement of the Participant, in each case as specified in the agreement
evidencing such Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified at the time the Restricted Stock Award is granted. (iv) Termination of Employment. The Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Agreement may provide for the forfeiture or cancellation of the Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award, in whole or in part, in the event of the termination of employment or service of the Participant to whom it was granted. (v)Stock Units. Except to the extent this Plan or the Committee specifies otherwise, Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Corporation and do not confer any of the rights of a stockholder until Shares are issued thereunder. Settlement of Stock Units upon expiration of the deferral or vesting period shall be made in Shares or otherwise as determined by the Committee. The number of Shares, or other settlement medium, to be so distributed may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents. Until a Stock Unit is so settled, the number of Shares represented by a Stock Unit shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11. Any Stock Units that are settled after the Participant's death shall be distributed to the Participant's designated beneficiary(ies) or, if none was designated, the Participant's estate. 9. OUTSIDE DIRECTOR AWARDS Each Outside Director may be granted Awards (each an "Outside Director Award") each fiscal year for up to 30,000 Shares, as determined by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the foregoing limitation shall be subject to adjustment under Section 11. The number of Shares subject to each Outside Director Award, or the formula pursuant to which such number shall be determined, the type or types of Awards included in the Outside Director Awards, the date of grant and the vesting, expiration and other terms applicable to such Outside Director Awards shall be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors, subject to the terms of this Plan, including the terms specified in Section 8. If the Board of Directors reasonably believes that an Outside Director has committed an act of misconduct as specified in Section 8(a)(v), the Board of Directors may suspend the Outside Director's right to exercise any Stock Option or SAR and/or the vesting of any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Board of Directors determines that an Outside Director has committed an act of misconduct, neither the Outside Director nor his or her estate shall be entitled to exercise any Stock Option or SAR whatsoever and shall forfeit any unvested Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award.
10. OTHER PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS (a) Transferability. Unless the agreement or other document evidencing an Award (or an amendment thereto authorized by the Committee) expressly states that the Award is transferable as provided hereunder, no Award granted under this Plan, nor any interest in such Award, may be sold, assigned, conveyed, gifted, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred in any manner prior to the vesting or lapse of any and all restrictions applicable thereto, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may grant an Award or amend an outstanding Award to provide that the Award is transferable or assignable (a) in the case of a transfer without the payment of any consideration, to any "family member" as such term is defined in Section 1(a)(5) of the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as such may be amended from time to time, and (b) in any transfer described in clause (ii) of Section 1(a)(5) of the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the 1933 Act as amended from time to time, provided that following any such transfer or assignment the Award will remain subject to substantially the same terms applicable to the Award while held by the Participant to whom it was granted, as modified as the Committee shall determine appropriate, and as a condition to such transfer the transferee shall execute an agreement agreeing to be bound by such terms; provided further, that an ISO may be transferred or assigned only to the extent consistent with Section 422 of the Code. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance that does not qualify under this Section 10(a) shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. (b) Qualifying Performance Criteria. For purposes of this Plan, the term "Qualifying Performance Criteria" shall mean any one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either the Corporation as a whole or to a business unit or Subsidiary, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre- established target, to previous years' results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Committee in the Award: (a) cash flow, (b) earnings per share, (c) earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, (d) return on equity, (e) total stockholder return, (f) share price performance, (g) return on capital, (h) return on assets or net assets, (i) revenue, (j) income or net income, (k) operating income or net operating income, (l) operating profit or net operating profit, (m) operating margin or profit margin, (n) return on operating revenue, (o) return on invested capital, (p) market segment share, (q) product release schedules, (r) new product innovation, (s) product cost reduction through advanced technology, (t) brand recognition/acceptance, (u) product ship targets, or (v) customer satisfaction. The Committee may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under a Qualifying Performance Criteria to exclude any of the following events that occurs during a performance period: (i) asset write-downs, (ii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (iii) the effect of changes in tax law, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, (iv) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs and (v) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Corporation's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year.
Notwithstanding satisfaction of any completion of any Qualifying Performance Criteria, to the extent specified at the time of grant of an Award, the number of Shares, Stock Options, SARs, Stock Units or other benefits granted, issued, retainable and/or vested under an Award on account of satisfaction of such Qualifying Performance Criteria may be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine. (c) Dividends. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment shall be made in Shares issuable under Awards on account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued to the holders of Shares prior to their issuance under any Award. The Committee shall specify whether dividends or dividend equivalent amounts shall be paid to any Participant with respect to the Shares subject to any Award that have not vested or been issued or that are subject to any restrictions or conditions on the record date for dividends. (d) Documents Evidencing Awards. The Committee shall, subject to applicable law, determine the date an Award is deemed to be granted. The Committee or, except to the extent prohibited under applicable law, its delegate(s) may establish the terms of agreements or other documents evidencing Awards under this Plan and may, but need not, require as a condition to any such agreement's or document's effectiveness that such agreement or document be executed by the Participant, including by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance, and that such Participant agree to such further terms and conditions as specified in such agreement or document. The grant of an Award under this Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in this Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as are expressly set forth in the agreement or other document evidencing such Award. (e) Additional Restrictions on Awards. Either at the time an Award is granted or by subsequent action, the Committee may, but need not, impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by a Participant of any Shares issued under an Award, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by the Participant or Participants, and (c) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers. (f) Subsidiary Awards. In the case of a grant of an Award to any Participant employed by a Subsidiary, such grant may, if the Committee so directs, be implemented by Intel issuing any subject Shares to the Subsidiary, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may determine, upon the condition or understanding that the Subsidiary will transfer the Shares to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, such Award may be issued by and in the name of the Subsidiary and shall be deemed granted on such date as the Committee shall determine.
11. ADJUSTMENT OF AND CHANGES IN THE COMMON STOCK (a) The existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Corporation or its shareholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations, exchanges, or other changes in the Corporation's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any issuance of Shares or other securities or subscription rights thereto, or any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares or other securities of the Corporation or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. Further, except as expressly provided herein or by the Committee, (i) the issuance by the Corporation of shares of stock or any class of securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash, property, labor or services, upon direct sale, upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Corporation convertible into such shares or other securities, (ii) the payment of a dividend in property other than Shares, or (iii) the occurrence of any similar transaction, and in any case whether or not for fair value, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to Stock Options or other Awards theretofore granted or the purchase price per Share, unless the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, that an adjustment is necessary or appropriate. (b) If the outstanding Shares or other securities of the Corporation, or both, for which the Award is then exercisable or as to which the Award is to be settled shall at any time be changed or exchanged by declaration of a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, extraordinary dividend of cash and/or assets, recapitalization, reorganization or any similar event affecting the Shares or other securities of the Corporation, the Committee may appropriately and equitably adjust the number and kind of Shares or other securities which are subject to this Plan or subject to any Awards theretofore granted, and the exercise or settlement prices of such Awards, so as to maintain the proportionate number of Shares or other securities without changing the aggregate exercise or settlement price. (c) No right to purchase fractional Shares shall result from any adjustment in Stock Options or SARs pursuant to this Section 11. In case of any such adjustment, the Shares subject to the Stock Option or SAR shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. (d) Any other provision hereof to the contrary notwithstanding (except Section 11(a)), in the event Intel is a party to a merger or other reorganization, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the agreement of merger or reorganization. Such agreement may provide, without limitation, for the assumption of outstanding Awards by the surviving corporation or its parent, for their continuation by Intel (if Intel is a surviving corporation), for accelerated vesting and accelerated expiration, or for settlement in cash.
12. LISTING OR QUALIFICATION OF COMMON STOCK In the event that the Board of Directors determines in its discretion that the listing or qualification of the Shares available for issuance under the Plan on any securities exchange or quotation or trading system or under any applicable law or governmental regulation is necessary as a condition to the issuance of such Shares, a Stock Option or SAR may not be exercised in whole or in part and a Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award shall not vest unless such listing, qualification, consent or approval has been unconditionally obtained. 13. TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN The Board of Directors may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan and the Board or the Committee may to the extent permitted by the Plan amend any agreement or other document evidencing an Award made under this Plan, provided, however, that the Corporation shall submit for stockholder approval any amendment (other than an amendment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of Section 11) required to be submitted for stockholder approval by NASDAQ or that otherwise would: (a) Increase the maximum number of Shares for which Awards may be granted under this Plan; (b) Reduce the price at which Stock Options may be granted below the price provided for in Section 8(a); (c) Reduce the option price of outstanding Stock Options; (d) Extend the term of this Plan; (e) Change the class of persons eligible to be Participants; or (f) Increase the limits in Section 6. In addition, no such amendment or alteration shall be made which would impair the rights of any Participant, without such Participant's consent, under any Award theretofore granted, provided that no such consent shall be required with respect to any amendment or alteration if the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such amendment or alteration either (i) is required or advisable in order for the Corporation, the Plan or the Award to satisfy any law or regulation or to meet the requirements of any accounting standard, or (ii) is not reasonably likely to significantly diminish the benefits provided under such Award, or that any such diminishment has been adequately compensated. 14. WITHHOLDING To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect
to any Stock Option, SAR, Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Award, or any sale of Shares. The Corporation shall not be required to issue Shares or to recognize the disposition of such Shares until such obligations are satisfied. To the extent permitted or required by the Committee, these obligations may or shall be satisfied by having the Corporation withhold a portion of the Shares of stock that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or by tendering Shares previously acquired by the Participant. 15. GENERAL PROVISIONS (a) Employment At Will. Neither the Plan nor the grant of any Award nor any action by the Corporation, any Subsidiary or the Committee shall be held or construed to confer upon any person any right to be continued in the employ of the Corporation or a Subsidiary. The Corporation and each Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to discharge, without liability but subject to his or her rights under this Plan, any Participant whenever in the sole discretion of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, its interest may so require. (b) Governing Law. This Plan and any agreements or other documents hereunder shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable federal law. The Committee may provide that any dispute as to any Award shall be presented and determined in such forum as the Committee may specify, including through binding arbitration. Any reference in this Plan or in the agreement or other document evidencing any Award to a provision of law or to a rule or regulation shall be deemed to include any successor law, rule or regulation of similar effect or applicability. (c) Unfunded Plan. Insofar as it provides for Awards, the Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants who are granted Awards under this Plan, any such accounts will be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Corporation shall not be required to segregate any assets which may at any time be represented by Awards, nor shall this Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Corporation or the Committee be deemed to be a trustee of stock or cash to be awarded under the Plan. 16. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF PLAN Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board of Directors nor the submission of this Plan to the shareholders of the Corporation for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board of Directors or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
17. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS This Plan, the grant and exercise of Awards thereunder, and the obligation of the Corporation to sell, issue or deliver Shares under such Awards, shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. The Corporation shall not be required to register in a Participant's name or deliver any Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such Shares under any federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable. To the extent the Corporation is unable to or the Committee deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Corporation's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Corporation shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. No Stock Option shall be exercisable and no Shares shall be issued and/or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Shares underlying such Stock Option is effective and current or the Corporation has determined that such registration is unnecessary. 18. LIABILITY OF CORPORATION The Corporation shall not be liable to a Participant or other persons as to: (a) the non-issuance or sale of Shares as to which the Corporation has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Corporation's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder; and (b) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Stock Option or other Award granted hereunder.

EXHIBIT 10.2 INTEL CORPORATION EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE MAY 18, 2005 1. PURPOSE The purpose of this amended and restated Executive Officer Incentive Plan ("Incentive Plan") is to motivate and reward eligible employees by making a portion of their cash compensation dependent on earnings per share ("EPS") of Intel Corporation (the "Company"). The Incentive Plan is designed to ensure that the annual incentive paid hereunder to executive officers of the Company is deductible without limit under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder (the "Tax Code"). This amended and restated Incentive Plan is subject to stockholder approval. 2. COVERED INDIVIDUALS The individuals entitled to incentive payments hereunder shall be the executive officers of the Company, as determined by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"). 3. THE COMMITTEE (a) The Committee shall consist of at least two outside directors of the Company who satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Tax Code. The Committee shall have the sole discretion and authority to administer and interpret the Incentive Plan in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Tax Code. (b) Subject to the express provisions and limitations set forth in the Incentive Plan, the Committee shall be authorized and empowered to do all things necessary or desirable, in its sole discretion, in connection with the administration of the Incentive Plan, including, without limitation, the following: (i)To prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Incentive Plan and to define terms not otherwise defined herein; (ii) To determine which covered persons are eligible to be paid incentives and to which of such participants, if any, incentives hereunder are actually paid; (iii) To verify the Company's EPS and the extent to which the Company has satisfied any other performance goals or other conditions applicable to the payment of incentives under the Incentive Plan; (iv) To prescribe and amend the terms of any agreements or other documents under the Incentive Plan (which need not be identical);
(v)To determine whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 4; (vi) To interpret and construe the Incentive Plan, any rules and regulations under the Incentive Plan, and the terms and conditions of any incentive opportunities provided hereunder, and to make exceptions to any such provisions in good faith and for the benefit of the Company; and (vii) To make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Incentive Plan. (c) All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Committee regarding the Incentive Plan shall be final and binding on all covered individuals who are participants under the Incentive Plan. The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems relevant to making such decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any director, officer or employee of the Company and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select. A covered individual or other person claiming any benefits under the Incentive Plan may contest a decision or action by the Committee with respect to such person or an actual or potential incentive under the Incentive Plan only on the grounds that such decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful, and any review of such decision or action shall be limited to determining whether the Committee's decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful. 4. AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE Incentive payments are made in cash. The maximum incentive payment is the product of (i) an individual incentive baseline amount in dollars for the performance period set by the Committee in writing and (ii) the numerical value of EPS for the performance period multiplied by a factor (the "Performance Factor") that is set by the Committee in its sole discretion and is in writing. The term "performance period" shall mean the period for which the incentive is payable. For this calculation, the term "EPS" shall mean the greater of operating income or net income per weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, for the performance period, in each case adjustable based upon qualifying objective criteria selected by the Committee in its sole discretion within the period prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Such criteria may include, but are not limited to asset write-downs; acquisition-related charges; litigation, claim judgments, settlements or tax settlements; the effects of changes in tax law, changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs; unrealized gains or losses on investments; and any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the annual report to stockholders for the applicable year. The individual incentive baseline amount, the Performance Factor and the EPS definition shall be adopted by the Committee in its sole discretion with respect to each performance period no later than the latest time permitted by the Tax Code. However, no incentive in excess of
$5,000,000 will be paid to any executive officer for any performance period. In its sole discretion, the Committee may also reduce, but may not increase, an individual's incentive calculated under the preceding formula. In determining the amount of any reduced incentive, the Committee reserves the right to apply subjective, discretionary criteria to determine a revised incentive amount. The incentive payable hereunder shall be paid in lieu of any incentive payable under the Company's broad-based variable cash incentive program. 5. PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE The payment of an incentive for a given performance period requires that the executive officer be on the Company's payroll as of the last day of the performance period. The Committee may make exceptions to this requirement in the case of retirement, death or disability, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. No incentive shall be paid unless and until the Committee makes a certification in writing as required to satisfy the conditions for exemption under Section 162(m) of the Tax Code. 6. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate this Incentive Plan at any time with respect to future services of covered individuals. Incentive Plan amendments may be adopted by the Board of Directors or the Committee as defined in Section 3, and will require stockholder approval only to the extent required to satisfy the conditions for exemption under Section 162(m) of the Tax Code or otherwise. 7. TAX WITHHOLDING The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Incentive Plan to a participant, net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid or withheld. The Company shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such participant such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the participant to pay such withholding taxes. If the participant shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such participant or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. 8. SEVERABILITY If any provision of the Incentive Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Incentive Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit provided for under the Incentive Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Incentive Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit provided for under the Incentive Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Incentive Plan. 9. NON-ASSIGNABILITY Unless the Committee expressly states otherwise, no participant in the Incentive Plan may sell, assign, convey, gift, pledge or otherwise hypothecate or alienate any incentive opportunity or amounts determined by the Committee to be payable under the Incentive Plan, until such amounts (if any) are actually paid. 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF PLAN Neither the adoption of the Incentive Plan by the Board of Directors nor the submission of the Incentive Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board of Directors or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including, without limitation, cash or equity-based compensation arrangements, either tied to performance or otherwise, and any such other arrangements as may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 11. EMPLOYMENT AT WILL Neither the Incentive Plan, selection of a person as a covered person eligible to be paid incentives under the Incentive Plan nor the payment of any incentive to any participant under the Incentive Plan nor any action by the Company or the Committee shall be held or construed to confer upon any person any right to be continued in the employ of the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right to discharge any participant whenever in the sole discretion of the Company its interest may so require. 12. NO VESTED INTEREST OR RIGHT At no time before the actual payout of an incentive to any participant under the Incentive Plan shall any participant accrue any vested interest or right whatsoever under the Incentive Plan, and the Company has no obligation to treat participants identically under the Incentive Plan. 13. GOVERNING LAW The Incentive Plan and any agreements and documents hereunder shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable federal law. The Committee may provide that any dispute concerning the Incentive Plan shall be presented and determined in such forum as the Committee may specify, including through binding arbitration.
