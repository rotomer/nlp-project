Exhibit 99.1 NEWS RELEASE CLEARWIRE SECURES $900M IN FINANCING ROUND LED BY INTEL CAPITAL AND ANNOUNCES THE SALE OF NEXTNET WIRELESS TO MOTOROLA Transactions to Accelerate the Development and Deployment of WiMAX Networks $600M Investment from Intel Capital, the Largest in its History Clearwire Selects Motorola to Supply Wireless Broadband Equipment KIRKLAND, Wash., SANTA CLARA, Calif., and SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (July 5, 2006) - Clearwire Corporation, a high-speed wireless broadband services provider founded by Craig McCaw, today announced a series of transactions with Intel Capital, the venture capital investment arm of Intel Corporation, Motorola and Motorola Ventures to accelerate the development and deployment of portable and mobile WiMAX networks based on the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard. The transactions include Intel Capital's investment of $600 million as part of a $900 million private financing round and Motorola's acquisition of Clearwire's subsidiary NextNet Wireless, a leading provider of OFDM-based non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless broadband infrastructure equipment. Motorola Ventures is also participating in the financing round. Following closing of the transactions, Motorola will supply wireless broadband equipment for Clearwire's existing and future networks globally. To hasten the proliferation of mobile WiMAX in PC clients, Intel will work to enable the inclusion of WiMAX chipsets in next generation mobile computing platforms. All three parties will contribute significant research and development resources to evolve NextNet Wireless' pre-WiMAX technologies.
"The size of this investment from Intel Capital underscores our commitment to supporting wireless broadband using WiMAX networks in the United States," said Intel Capital President Arvind Sodhani. "Our collaboration with Clearwire and Motorola builds on the foundation of previous WiMAX network deployment investments made by Intel Capital throughout the world to bring the benefits of mobile high- speed and content-rich Internet access to wireless broadband users." "Wi-Fi has become an essential part of people's lives. WiMAX is next. It is rapidly moving from a technology initiative to real deployments," said Sean Maloney Intel executive vice president and general manager, Mobility Group. "As Intel plans the integration of mobile WiMAX into our Centrino Mobile Technology notebook platforms, it is incredibly important to collaborate with the broadband wireless providers who will offer WiMAX services. This investment in Clearwire will lay the foundation for high- speed mobile broadband services across North America." As part of the transaction, Motorola will acquire Clearwire's subsidiary NextNet Wireless, one of the industry's leading fixed and portable NLOS wireless broadband equipment suppliers, for an undisclosed amount. NextNet's wireless access products are currently deployed by carriers on five continents. Acquiring NextNet broadens Motorola's global portfolio of solutions to serve the rapidly growing need for wireless broadband equipment. "We look forward to accelerating the benefits of WiMAX low-cost, high-speed wireless internet access to consumers around the world," said Greg Brown, president of Motorola's networks and enterprise business. "Our acquisition of NextNet furthers
Motorola's strategy to continue to expand and profitably grow our wireless broadband business and furthers our efforts in seamless wireless broadband mobility." "Collaborating with Intel and Motorola significantly advances our vision for fixed, portable and mobile wireless broadband services," said Craig McCaw, founder, chairman, and co-CEO of Clearwire. "Wireless broadband networks will enable the creation and delivery of differentiated services and applications that enhance the way people communicate and experience the Internet." "These agreements mark a significant milestone for Clearwire," said Ben Wolff, co-CEO of Clearwire. "We believe that there is strong demand for wireless broadband connectivity that is simple, fast, reliable and affordable. Working together with Intel and Motorola to deploy mobile WiMAX technology will provide us with the benefits of a standards-based platform, which will further enhance our efforts to address this demand." Closing of the transactions is subject to regulatory approval and certain closing conditions.
