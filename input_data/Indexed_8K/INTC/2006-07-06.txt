Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On July 6, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") approved the form of restricted stock unit agreements and stock option agreements to be used in connection with standard grants of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options to U.S employees and non-U.S. employees on a broad- based basis ("Standard Awards"), including executive officers of the Corporation. The Compensation Committee also approved the form of RSU agreements and stock option agreements to be used in connection with RSU grants and stock option grants to executive officers pursuant to the Corporation's Executive Long Term Stock Program ("ELTSOP Awards"). Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards are incentive and retention awards made pursuant to the Corporation's stockholder-approved 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). There is no material relationship between the Corporation and recipients of ELTSOP Awards, other than in respect of their employment with the Corporation. The forms of Standard Awards for U.S and non-U.S. employees set forth the terms and conditions of RSUs and stock options granted pursuant to the 2006 Plan and the Corporation's standard RSU and stock option programs. The forms of ELTSOP Awards for U.S. and non-U.S. employees set forth the terms and conditions of RSUs and stock options granted pursuant to the 2006 Plan and the Corporation's ELTSOP RSU and stock option programs. The following description is qualified by reference to the terms of the forms of RSU agreements and stock option agreements (for Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards) and the Notice of Grant, copies of which are filed with this Form 8- K, and to the terms of the 2006 Plan, a copy of which was filed as exhibit 10.1 to the Corporation's Form 8-K dated May 22, 2006. Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards of RSUs and stock options are subject to administration and interpretation by the committee of the Board of Directors designated pursuant to the plan, or by its delegate. Unvested Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards are cancelled as of the date of employment termination as set forth in the form of RSU and stock option agreements. Vested stock options expire after employment termination as set forth in the form of stock option agreements. Standard Awards typically vest 25% annually beginning one year after the date of grant and ELTSOP Awards typically vest 100% five years after the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting upon death and Disablement. Standard Awards, but not ELTSOP Awards, are also subject to accelerated vesting upon Retirement. If employment is terminated due to misconduct, Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards will be cancelled, such that RSUs will not convert to shares of common stock and stock options will not be exercisable. Until shares are issued for vested RSUs or exercised stock options, Standard Awards and ELTSOP Awards do not provide recipients any rights of
a stockholder and do not accrue dividend equivalent rights. Standard and ELTSOP Awards of RSUs are not transferable. Standard and ELTSOP Awards of stock options are transferable at death by will or the laws of descent and distribution or by gift to the permitted transferees identified in the stock option agreement. Where applicable, the Corporation uses country- specific RSU and stock option agreements to comply with local laws. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (d) Exhibits.

INTEL CORPORATION (Registrant) By: /s/ Cary I. Klafter ------------------ Cary I. Klafter Date: July 6, 2006 Secretary

Exhibit 10.1 INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED ON AND AFTER MAY 17, 2006 UNDER THE INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (standard RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT Unless provided otherwise in the Notice of Grant, these standard terms and conditions ("Standard Terms") apply to Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") granted to you, a U.S. employee, under the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). Your Notice of Grant, these Standard Terms and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in these Standard Terms. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and these Standard Terms. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. 3. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of these Standard Terms and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken
any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 4. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 4: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 7 through 9 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 5. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8. (a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8. (a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision.
For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 7. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 8. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 8, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 9. RETIREMENT For purposes of these Standard Terms, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or
(b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value on the date of vesting. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of vesting of a RSU and, if applicable, any sale of shares of the Common Stock. The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability.
11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER AND RESTRICTIONS Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in these Standard Terms. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to these Standard Terms at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Standard Terms or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of these Standard Terms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under the Standard Terms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 14(f) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS
(a) Certain capitalized terms used in these Standard Terms are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by these Standard Terms and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard Terms, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by these Standard Terms shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify these Standard Terms or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in these Standard Terms creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 14(e) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance
promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (f) Because these Standard Terms relate to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of these Standard Terms is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to these Standard Terms or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (g) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.

Exhibit 10.2 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. 3. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative,
in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 4. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 4: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 7 through 9 hereof.
(b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 5. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8. (a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8. (a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment.
7. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 8. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 8, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 9. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the entire Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in
accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to
transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 15(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the
names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.
(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the
payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 15(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.

Exhibit 10.3 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to electronically sign this Agreement within 180 days of the Grant Date, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 11 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of
employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 10(a) or Section 10(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting:
(a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the entire Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 11. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which
all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 11 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 12. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 13. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 16(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious.
14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level.
16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other
remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 16(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance
promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your electronic signature, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of the RSUs set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO ELECTRONICALLY SIGN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE RSUs (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.4 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to print and sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 180 days of the Grant Date, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 11 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of
employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 10(a) or Section 10(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting:
(a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the entire Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 11. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which
all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 11 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 12. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 13. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 16(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious.
14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level.
16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other
remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 16(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance
promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your signature below, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of the RSUs set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO SIGN AND RETURN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE RSUs (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 10(a) or Section 10(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting:
(a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the entire Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 11. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which
all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 11 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 12. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 13. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 16(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious.
14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level.
16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other
remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 16(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance
promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your electronic signature, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of the RSUs set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO ELECTRONICALLY SIGN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE RSUs (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.6 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to print and sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 60 days after receipt of your Notice of Grant, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 11 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of
employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Upon your Retirement, vesting of your RSUs shall be accelerated to the extent provided in Section 10(a) or Section 10(b) below (but not to the extent provided under both provisions together), whichever results in the greater number of RSUs vesting:
(a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within a number of whole years from the date of your Retirement determined by dividing the number of years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years) by five (5), rounded down to the nearest whole number of years, shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the entire Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), then all RSUs that were scheduled to vest within one year of the date of your Retirement shall vest as of the date of your Retirement. 11. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which
all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest.

(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 16(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance
promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.

Exhibit 10.7 INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED ON AND AFTER MAY 17, 2006 UNDER THE INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted under the ELTSOP RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT Unless provided otherwise in the Notice of Grant, these standard terms and conditions ("Standard Terms") apply to Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") granted to you, a U.S. employee, under the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). Your Notice of Grant, these Standard Terms and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in these Standard Terms. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and these Standard Terms. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. 3. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 9 of these Standard Terms and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken
any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 4. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 4: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 7 through 9 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 5. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8. (a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision.
For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 7. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 8. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms and upon your termination of employment as a result of a determination of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. For purposes of this Section 8, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 9. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value on the date of vesting. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of vesting of a RSU and, if applicable, any sale of shares of the Common Stock. The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS
Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 10. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER AND RESTRICTIONS Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in these Standard Terms. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to these Standard Terms at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Standard Terms or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee.
RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. 11. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of these Standard Terms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under the Standard Terms, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 13(f) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 12. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 13. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in these Standard Terms are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by these Standard Terms and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard Terms, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by these Standard Terms shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify these Standard Terms or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.
(d) Nothing contained in these Standard Terms creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 13(e) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (f) Because these Standard Terms relate to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of these Standard Terms is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to these Standard Terms or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (g) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.

In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 4.

(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 7 through 9 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 5. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision.
For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 7. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 8.

For purposes of this Section 8, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 9. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable).
The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations.

RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.

11. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 14(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 12. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 13.

You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 14. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your
"separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 14(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.

Exhibit 10.9 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to electronically sign this Agreement within 180 days of the Grant Date, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination,
regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws.
To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 15(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in
the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities
of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of
employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 15(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your electronic signature, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of the RSUs set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO ELECTRONICALLY SIGN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE RSUs (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.10 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to print and sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 180 days of the Grant Date, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled. 4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK
Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: 1. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and 2. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond
the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a
Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the
payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.
You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 15(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections
than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.
(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law.
(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 15(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your signature below, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of the RSUs set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO SIGN AND RETURN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE RSUs (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.11 INTEL KABUSHIKI KAISHA RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to electronically sign this Agreement within 180 days of the Grant Date, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and b. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination,
regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws.
To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 15(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in
the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities
of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of
employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 15(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.

Exhibit 10.12 INTEL CORPORATION RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for RSUs granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP RSU program) 1. TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the "Corporation") regarding the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") identified in your Notice of Grant. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to print and sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 60 days after receipt of your Notice of Grant, the RSUs subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. 3. VESTING OF RSUs Provided that you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a full time basis from the Grant Date specified in the Notice of Grant through each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), specified on the Notice of Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on which the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") is not open, affected RSUs shall vest on the next following NASDAQ business day. The number of shares of Common Stock into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to the 2006 Plan. RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as an Employee terminates for any reason except death, or Disablement (defined below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
4. CONVERSION INTO COMMON STOCK Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable following vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 10 of this Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation's counsel, is necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence under the Intel Leave Guidelines ("PLOA"), your RSUs will vest only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: 1. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that (but for this provision) would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated) or, if you return on a day that the NASDAQ is not open, the next following NASDAQ business day; and 2. The vesting date set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that are scheduled to vest following the date that the PLOA is terminated shall not be affected by the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant for any RSUs that follow the commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred beyond the dates set forth in the Notice of Grant by a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. (3) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA, then in addition to the effect on the vesting dates set forth in clause (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 5, any RSUs that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be cancelled as of the date of your termination of employment, as applicable, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of RSUs shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF RSU FOR MISCONDUCT If at any time the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee"), including any Subcommittee or "Authorized Officer" (as defined in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan) notifies the Corporation that they reasonably believe that you have committed an act of misconduct as described in Section 8(a)(v) of the 2006 Plan (embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Corporation, breach of fiduciary duty or deliberate disregard of Corporation rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Corporation, an unauthorized disclosure of any Corporation trade secret or confidential information, any conduct constituting unfair competition, inducing any customer to breach a contract with the Corporation or inducing any principal for whom the Corporation acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship), the vesting of your RSUs may be suspended pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed. If the Corporation determines that you have committed an act of misconduct, all RSUs not vested as of the date the Corporation was notified that you may have committed an act of misconduct shall be cancelled and neither you nor any beneficiary shall be entitled to any claim with respect to the RSUs whatsoever. Any determination by the Committee or an Authorized Officer with respect to the foregoing shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death, or Disablement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination,
regardless of whether such employment termination is as a result of a divestiture or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) an the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are specifically designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. For purposes of this provision, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel RSU grants, nor would your transfer from the Corporation to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to the Corporation be deemed a termination of employment. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment terminates as a result of Disablement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. TAX WITHHOLDING RSUs are taxable upon vesting based on the market value in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. RSUs are taxable in accordance with the existing or future tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws.
To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting of a RSU, vesting of a RSU or any sale of shares of the Common Stock (whichever is applicable). The Corporation shall not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the previous sentence, you authorize UBS Financial Services Inc., or any successor plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay such tax withholding to the Corporation. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 11. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
your RSUs other than as permitted above, shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares. As a condition to having the right to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs, you acknowledge that unvested RSUs shall have no value for purposes of any aspect of your employment relationship with the Corporation. 12. DISPUTES Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan, any adjustments required to be made thereunder, and any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, your Notice of Grant, the RSUs or the 2006 Plan shall be determined by the Committee (including any person(s) to whom the Committee has delegated its authority) in its sole and absolute discretion. Such decision by the Committee shall be final and binding unless determined pursuant to Section 15(e) to have been arbitrary and capricious. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in
the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER TERMS; OTHER MATTERS (a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. The grant of RSUs to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities
of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, your RSUs are subject to reduction by the Corporation if you change your employment classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. (g) RSUs are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (h) In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of your RSUs or diminution in value of the RSUs or Common Stock acquired through vested RSUs resulting from termination of your active employment by the Corporation (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and you hereby release the Corporation from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such claim. (i) Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, in the event of involuntary termination of your employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to receive the RSUs and vest in RSUs under the 2006 Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of involuntary termination of employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), your right to sell shares of Common Stock that converted from vested RSUs after termination of
employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant or the 2006 Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of your termination of employment with the Corporation, you are a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you pursuant to the RSUs would constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, no such payment or benefit will be provided under the RSUs until the earliest of (A) the date which is six (6) months after your "separation from service" for any reason, other than death or "disability" (as such terms are used in Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code), (B) the date of your death or "disability" (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Code) or (C) the effective date of a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation (as such term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code). The provisions of this Section 15(j) shall only apply to the extent required to avoid your incurrence of any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. (k) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. By your signature below, you and Intel Corporation agree that the RSUs identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan.

Exhibit 10.14 INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED ON AND AFTER MAY 17, 2006 UNDER THE INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (standard option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION The following standard terms and conditions ("Standard Terms") apply to Non-Qualified Stock Options granted to U.S. employees under the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan") (other than grants made under the SOP Plus or ELTSOP programs). 2. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION The option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 3. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of the option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel" or the "Corporation"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 4. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and the requirements of these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 or Sections 7 through 10 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after seven (7) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel
where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when Intel determines that the exercisability of the option or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Standard Terms or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. IF AN EXPIRATION DATE DESCRIBED HEREIN FALLS ON A WEEKDAY, YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE 3:45 P.M. NEW YORK TIME ON THE EXPIRATION DATE. IF AN EXPIRATION DATE DESCRIBED HEREIN FALLS ON A WEEKEND OR ANY OTHER DAY ON WHICH THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET ("NASDAQ") IS NOT OPEN, YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE 3:45 P.M. NEW YORK TIME ON THE LAST NASDAQ BUSINESS DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in by these Standard Terms, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days:
a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA shall vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 7 through 10 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination.
7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in by these Standard Terms, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), Retirement (defined below) or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from Intel or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in by these Standard Terms, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in by these Standard Terms, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after terminating your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 8, to the extent that it is unexercised. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to
the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 9; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 7 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of these Standard Terms, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. RETIREMENT For purposes of by these Standard Terms, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Following your Retirement, the vesting of the option, to the extent that it had not vested on or prior to the date of your Retirement, shall be accelerated as follows: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), you will receive one year of additional vesting from your date of Retirement for every five (5) years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years). No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with Intel, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), you will receive accelerated vesting of any portion of the option that would have vested prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement. You will receive vesting acceleration pursuant to either Standard Retirement or the Rule of 75, but not both. Except as expressly provided otherwise in by these Standard Terms, following your Retirement from the Corporation, you may exercise the option at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement, to the extent that it had vested as of the date of your Retirement or to the extent that vesting of the option is accelerated pursuant to this Section 10. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from your date of Retirement, to the extent that it is unexercised. 11. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING
Nonqualified stock options are taxable upon exercise. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise and, if applicable, any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 12. TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, each option shall be transferable only (a) pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries, or (b) by gift to your Immediate Family (defined below), partnerships whose only partners are you or members of your Immediate Family, limited liability companies whose only shareholders are you or members of your Immediate Family, or trusts established solely for the benefit of you or members of your Immediate Family, or (c) by gift to a foundation in which you and/or members of your Immediate Family control the management of the foundation's assets. For purposes of these Standard Terms, "Immediate Family" is defined as your spouse or domestic partner, children, grandchildren, parents, or siblings. With respect to transfers by gift under subsection (b), options are transferable whether vested or not at the time of transfer. With respect to transfers by gift under subsection (c), options are transferable only to the extent the options are vested at the time of transfer. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance that does not qualify under subsections (a), (b) and (c) above shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. Any option transferred by you pursuant to this section shall not be transferable by the recipient except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 13. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option.
14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of these Standard Terms and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in these Standard Terms are defined in the 2006 Plan. These Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard Terms, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by these Standard Terms shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify these Standard Terms or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in these Standard Terms creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof. (f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.
(g) Because these Standard Terms relate to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of these Standard Terms is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to these Standard Terms or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

Exhibit 10.15 INTEL CORPORATION NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant of Stock Options delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, set forth the terms of your option identified in the Notice of Grant. As used herein, the "Corporation" shall mean Intel Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 2. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 3. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 4. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 or Sections 7 through 10 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after seven (7) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's
stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full- time employee to a part-time employee. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and
b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 7 through 10 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), Retirement (defined below) or
discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 8, to the extent that it is unexercised. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 9; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options
that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 7 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Following your Retirement, the vesting of the option, to the extent that it had not vested on or prior to the date of your Retirement, shall be accelerated as follows: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), you will receive one year of additional vesting from your date of Retirement for every five (5) years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years). No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), you will receive accelerated vesting of any portion of the option that would have vested prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement. You will receive vesting acceleration pursuant to either Standard Retirement or the Rule of 75, but not both. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your Retirement from the Corporation, you may exercise the option at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement, to the extent that it had vested as of the date of your Retirement or to the extent that vesting of the option is accelerated pursuant to this Section 10. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from your date of Retirement, to the extent that it is unexercised. 11. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to
Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 12. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 13. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections
than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your options. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan.

(b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity.

may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), Retirement (defined below) or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination.

The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Following your Retirement, the vesting of the option, to the extent that it had not vested on or prior to the date of your Retirement, shall be accelerated as follows: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), you will receive one year of additional vesting from your date of Retirement for every five (5) years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years). No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), you will receive accelerated vesting of any portion of the option that would have vested prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement.

it had vested as of the date of your Retirement or to the extent that vesting of the option is accelerated pursuant to this Section 11. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from your date of Retirement, to the extent that it is unexercised. 12. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 13. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 14. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 15. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 16. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home
address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your options. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 17. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. This Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that
Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof. (f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. (g) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. By your electronic signature, you and Intel Corporation agree that the options identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understand the terms of the options set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO ELECTRONICALLY SIGN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE OPTIONS (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.17 INTEL CORPORATION NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted after May 17, 2006 under the standard option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant of Stock Options delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, set forth the terms of your option identified in the Notice of Grant. As used herein, the "Corporation" shall mean Intel Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 2. SIGNATURE This option cannot be exercised until you sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services. If you fail to sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 180 days of the Grant Date, the option will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. Signing this agreement does not obligate you to exercise the option or purchase any shares. 3. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 4. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 5. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the
requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 or Sections 8 through 11 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after seven (7) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan and by your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the U.S. or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full- time employee to a part-time employee. 6. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 6: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 through 11 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 8 through 11 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 through 11 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 7. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors,
as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), Retirement (defined below) or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 8, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 9. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 9, to the extent that it is unexercised.
10. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 10; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 8 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Following your Retirement, the vesting of the option, to the extent that it had not vested on or prior to the date of your Retirement, shall be accelerated as follows: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), you will receive one year of additional vesting from your date of Retirement for every five (5) years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years). No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), you will receive accelerated vesting of any portion of the option that would have vested prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement. You will receive vesting acceleration pursuant to either Standard Retirement or the Rule of 75, but not both. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your Retirement from the Corporation, you may exercise the option at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement, to the extent that
it had vested as of the date of your Retirement or to the extent that vesting of the option is accelerated pursuant to this Section 11. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from your date of Retirement, to the extent that it is unexercised. 12. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 13. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 14. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 15. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 16. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan.

The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. RETIREMENT For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean either Standard Retirement (as defined below) or the Rule of 75 (as defined below). Following your Retirement, the vesting of the option, to the extent that it had not vested on or prior to the date of your Retirement, shall be accelerated as follows: (a) If you retire at or after age 60 ("Standard Retirement"), you will receive one year of additional vesting from your date of Retirement for every five (5) years that you have been employed by the Corporation (measured in complete, whole years). No vesting acceleration shall occur for any periods of employment of less than five (5) years; or (b) If, when you terminate employment with the Corporation, your age plus years of service (in each case measured in complete, whole years) equals or exceeds 75 ("Rule of 75"), you will receive accelerated vesting of any portion of the option that would have vested prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement. You will receive vesting acceleration pursuant to either Standard Retirement or the Rule of 75, but not both. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your Retirement from the Corporation, you may exercise the option at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your Retirement, to the extent that it had vested as of the date of your Retirement or to the extent that vesting of the option is accelerated pursuant to this Section 11. The option shall
terminate on the 365th day from your date of Retirement, to the extent that it is unexercised. 12. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 13. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 14. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 15. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 16. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or
other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your options. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 17. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. This Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that
Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount (b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof. (f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. (g) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. By your electronic signature, you and Intel Corporation agree that the options identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understand the terms of the options set forth in this Agreement. FAILURE TO ELECTRONICALLY SIGN WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE GRANT DATE WILL RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE OPTIONS (SEE SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT).

Exhibit 10.19 INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED ON AND AFTER MAY 17, 2006 UNDER THE INTEL CORPORATION 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted under the ELTSOP option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION The following terms and conditions (these "Standard Terms") apply to Nonqualified Stock Options granted to U.S. employees under the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan") for grants formerly known as ELTSOP grants. 2. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION The option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 3. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of the option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel" or the "Corporation"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 4. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and the requirements of these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 or Sections 7 through 9 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by these Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as
soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when Intel determines that the exercisability of the option or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Standard Terms or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full-time to a part-time employee. IF AN EXPIRATION DATE DESCRIBED HEREIN FALLS ON A WEEKDAY, YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE 3:45 P.M. NEW YORK TIME ON THE EXPIRATION DATE. IF AN EXPIRATION DATE DESCRIBED HEREIN FALLS ON A WEEKEND OR ANY OTHER DAY ON WHICH THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET ("NASDAQ") IS NOT OPEN, YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE 3:45 P.M. NEW YORK TIME ON THE LAST NASDAQ BUSINESS DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days:
a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA shall vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA, however, in no event shall the term of the option be extended beyond ten (10) years from the date of grant. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 7 through 9 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 and 9 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors,
as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from Intel or a Subsidiary, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after terminating your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 8, to the extent that it is unexercised.
9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Standard Terms, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 9; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 7 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of these Standard Terms, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING Nonqualified stock options are taxable upon exercise. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise and, if applicable, any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 11. TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, each option shall be transferable only (a) pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries, or (b) by gift to your Immediate Family (defined below), partnerships whose only partners are you or members of your Immediate Family, limited liability companies whose only shareholders are you or members of your Immediate Family, or trusts established solely for the benefit of you or members of your Immediate Family, or
(c) by gift to a foundation in which you and/or members of your Immediate Family control the management of the foundation's assets. For purposes of these Standard Terms, "Immediate Family" is defined as your spouse or domestic partner, children, grandchildren, parents, or siblings. With respect to transfers by gift under subsection (b), options are transferable whether vested or not at the time of transfer. With respect to transfers by gift under subsection (c), options are transferable only to the extent the options are vested at the time of transfer. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance that does not qualify under subsections (a), (b) and (c) above shall be void and unenforceable against the Corporation. Any option transferred by you pursuant to this section shall not be transferable by the recipient except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 12. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of these Standard Terms and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in these Standard Terms are defined in the 2006 Plan. These Standard Terms, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount.
(b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Standard Terms, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by these Standard Terms shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify these Standard Terms or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in these Standard Terms creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof. (f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. (g) Because these Standard Terms relate to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of these Standard Terms is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to these Standard Terms or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

Exhibit 10.20 INTEL CORPORATION NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant of Stock Options delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, set forth the terms of your option identified in the Notice of Grant for grants formerly known as ELTSOP grants. As used herein, the "Corporation" shall mean Intel Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 2. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 3. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 4. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 or Sections 7 through 9 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date of grant.
The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full-time employee to a part-time employee. 5. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 5: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days:
a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA, however, in no event shall the term of the option be extended beyond ten (10) years from the date of grant. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 9 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 7 through 9 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 8 through 9 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 6. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach
of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 7, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 8. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment
termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 8, to the extent that it is unexercised. 9. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 9; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 7 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 10. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the
extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 11. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 12. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 13. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 14. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and
managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your options. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 15. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. This Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the
reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof. (f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. (g) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

Exhibit 10.21 INTEL CORPORATION NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant of Stock Options delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, set forth the terms of your option identified in the Notice of Grant for grants formerly known as ELTSOP grants. As used herein, the "Corporation" shall mean Intel Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to electronically sign this Agreement within 180 days of the Grant Date, the options subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. Signing this agreement does not obligate you to exercise the option or purchase any shares. 3. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 4. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 5. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may
exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 or Sections 8 through 10 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full- time employee to a part-time employee. 6. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 6: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA, however, in no event shall the term of the option be extended beyond ten (10) years from the date of grant. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 through 10 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 8 through 10 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 and 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 7. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to
exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 8, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 9. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 9, to the extent that it is unexercised.
10. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 10; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 8 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 12. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 13. DISPUTES
The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.

You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you
hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference.

essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

If you fail to sign this Agreement and return it to Intel Benefit Services within 180 days of the Grant Date, the option will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. Signing this agreement does not obligate you to exercise the option or purchase any shares. 3. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 4. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 5. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and
subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 or Sections 8 through 10 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full- time employee to a part-time employee. 6. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 6: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior
to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA. (2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA, however, in no event shall the term of the option be extended beyond ten (10) years from the date of grant. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 through 10 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 8 through 10 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 and 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 7. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty,
unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 8, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 9. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination.
The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 9, to the extent that it is unexercised. 10. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 10; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 8 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 12. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION
You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 13. DISPUTES The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan ("Data"). You hereby understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock acquired under your options. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse
or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. You hereby understand, however, that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level. 16. THE 2006 PLAN AND OTHER AGREEMENTS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The provisions of this Agreement and the 2006 Plan are incorporated into the Notice of Grant by reference. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006 Plan has been made available to you. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. This Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and the Corporation regarding the option. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the option are superseded. The grant of an option to an employee in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate Intel or any Subsidiary to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that Intel or any Subsidiary might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount. (b) Options are not part of your employment contract (if any) with the Corporation, your salary, your normal or expected compensation, or other remuneration for any purposes, including for purposes of computing severance pay or other termination compensation or indemnity. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to the options covered by this Agreement shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have an adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Corporation, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement or cancel and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested options at the time of such determination. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement creates or implies an employment contract or term of employment upon which you may rely. (e) To the extent that the option refers to the Common Stock of Intel, and as required by the laws of your country of residence or employment, only authorized but unissued shares thereof shall be utilized for delivery upon exercise by the holder in accord with the terms hereof.
(f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office. (g) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may purchase Common Stock of Intel, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the option granted hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. By your signature below, you and Intel Corporation agree that the options under the ELTSOP program identified in your Notice of Grant are governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, and the 2006 Plan. You further acknowledge that you have read and understand the terms of the options set forth in this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.23 INTEL KABUSHIKI KAISHA NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (for options granted after May 17, 2006 under the ELTSOP option program) 1. TERMS OF OPTION This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement"), the Notice of Grant of Stock Options delivered herewith (the "Notice of Grant") and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), as such may be amended from time to time, set forth the terms of your option identified in the Notice of Grant for grants formerly known as ELTSOP grants. As used herein, the "Corporation" shall mean Intel Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 2. SIGNATURE If you fail to electronically sign this Agreement within 180 days of the Grant Date, the options subject to your Notice of Grant will be cancelled, except as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. Signing this agreement does not obligate you to exercise the option or purchase any shares. 3. NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION This option is not intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be interpreted accordingly. 4. OPTION PRICE The exercise price of this option (the "option price") is 100% of the market value of the common stock of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), $.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), on the date of grant, as specified in the Notice of Grant. "Market value" means the average of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by NASDAQ. 5. TERM OF OPTION AND EXERCISE OF OPTION To the extent the option has become exercisable (vested) during the periods indicated in the Notice of Grant and has not been previously exercised, and subject to termination or acceleration as provided in this Agreement and the requirements of this Agreement, the Notice of Grant and the 2006 Plan, you may
exercise the option to purchase up to the number of shares of the Common Stock set forth in the Notice of Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 or Sections 8 through 10 hereof, no part of the option may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date of grant. The process for exercising the option (or any part thereof) is governed by this Agreement, the Notice of Grant, the 2006 Plan and your agreements with Intel's stock plan administrator. Exercises of stock options will be processed as soon as practicable. The option price may be paid (a) in cash, (b) by arrangement with Intel's stock plan administrator which is acceptable to Intel where payment of the option price is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock issuable under the option to Intel, (c) by delivery of any other lawful consideration approved in advance by the Committee of the Board of Directors of Intel established pursuant to the 2006 Plan (the "Committee") or its delegate, or (d) in any combination of the foregoing. Fractional shares may not be exercised. Shares of the Common Stock will be issued as soon as practicable. You will have the rights of a stockholder only after the shares of the Common Stock have been issued. For administrative or other reasons, Intel may from time to time suspend the ability of employees to exercise options for limited periods of time. Notwithstanding the above, Intel shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock if such delivery is prohibited by the laws of the United States or your country of residence or employment. If such delivery is prohibited at the time that all or part of the option is exercised, then such exercise may be made only in accordance with Intel's "cashless exercise" procedure, to the extent permitted under the laws of the United States and your country of residence or employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the applicable Notice of Grant, Intel may reduce your unvested options if you change classification from a full- time employee to a part-time employee. 6. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you take a personal leave of absence ("PLOA"), the option will be exercisable only to the extent and during the times specified in this Section 6: (1) If the duration of the PLOA is 365 days or less, you may exercise any part of the option that vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA at any time during the PLOA. If the duration of the PLOA is greater than 365 days, any part of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA and that has not been exercised will terminate on the 365th day of the PLOA.
(2) If the duration of the PLOA is less than thirty (30) days: a. The exercisability of any part of the option that would have vested during the PLOA shall be deferred until the first day that you return to work (i.e., the date that the PLOA is terminated); and b. Any part of the option that had not vested at the commencement of the PLOA and would not have vested during the PLOA will vest in accordance with the normal schedule indicated in the Notice of Grant and shall not be affected by the PLOA. (3) If the duration of the PLOA equals or exceeds thirty (30) days, the exercisability of each part of the option scheduled to vest after commencement of the PLOA shall be deferred for a period of time equal to the duration of the PLOA, however, in no event shall the term of the option be extended beyond ten (10) years from the date of grant. If you terminate employment after returning from the PLOA but prior to the end of such deferral period, you shall have no right to exercise any unvested portion of the option, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 through 10 hereof, and such option shall terminate as of the date that your employment terminates. (4) If you terminate employment with the Corporation during a PLOA: a. Any portions of the option that had vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall be exercisable in accordance with Sections 8 through 10 hereof, as applicable; and b. Any portions of the option that had not vested prior to the commencement of the PLOA shall terminate, except to the extent provided otherwise in Sections 9 and 10 hereof. (b) If you take an approved Leave of Absence ("LOA") other than a PLOA under Intel Leave Guidelines, the vesting of your options shall be unaffected by such absence and will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. 7. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OPTION FOR MISCONDUCT If you have allegedly committed an act of misconduct as defined in the 2006 Plan, including, but not limited to, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty or nonpayment of an obligation owed to the Corporation, an Authorized Officer, as defined in the 2006 Plan, may suspend your right to
exercise the option, pending a decision by the Committee (or Board of Directors, as the case may be) or an Authorized Officer to terminate the option. The option cannot be exercised during such suspension or after such termination. 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your employment by the Corporation terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than death, Disablement (defined below), or discharge for misconduct, you may exercise any portion of the option that had vested on or prior to the date of termination at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the date of such termination. The option shall terminate on the 90th day to the extent that it is unexercised. All unvested stock options shall be cancelled on the date of employment termination, regardless of whether such employment termination is voluntary or involuntary. For purposes of this Section 8, your employment is not deemed terminated if, prior to sixty (60) days after the date of termination from the Corporation, you are rehired by Intel or a Subsidiary on a basis that would make you eligible for future Intel stock option grants, nor would your transfer from Intel to any Subsidiary or from any one Subsidiary to another, or from a Subsidiary to Intel be deemed a termination of employment. Further, your employment with any partnership, joint venture or corporation not meeting the requirements of a Subsidiary in which Intel or a Subsidiary is a party shall be considered employment for purposes of this provision if either (a) the entity is designated by the Committee as a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision or (b) you are designated as an employee of a Subsidiary for purposes of this provision. 9. DEATH Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die while employed by the Corporation, the executor of your will, administrator of your estate or any successor trustee of a grantor trust may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not vested on the date of death, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die prior to ninety (90) days after termination of your employment with the Corporation, the executor of your will or administrator of your estate may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and to the extent the option had vested on or prior to the date of your employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the date of your employment termination. The option shall terminate on the applicable expiration date described in this Section 9, to the extent that it is unexercised.
10. DISABILITY Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, following your termination of employment due to Disablement, you may exercise the option, to the extent not previously exercised and whether or not the option had vested on or prior to the date of employment termination, at any time prior to 365 days from the later of the date of your termination of employment due to your Disablement or the date of determination of your Disablement as described in this Section 10; provided, however, that while the claim of Disablement is pending, options that were unvested at termination of employment may not be exercised and options that were vested at termination of employment may be exercised only during the period set forth in Section 8 hereof. The option shall terminate on the 365th day from the date of determination of Disablement, to the extent that it is unexercised. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disablement" shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation or the Subsidiary that employs you, "Disablement" shall have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders an individual incapable of performing work in any occupation, as determined by the Corporation. 11. INCOME TAXES WITHHOLDING You will be subject to taxation in accordance with the tax laws of the country where you are resident or employed. If you are an U.S. citizen or expatriate, you may also be subject to U.S. tax laws. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, you shall make arrangements satisfactory to Intel (or the Subsidiary that employs you, if your Subsidiary is involved in the administration of the 2006 Plan) for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an option exercise or any sale of shares of the Common Stock. Intel shall not be required to issue shares of the Common Stock or to recognize any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied. The Committee may permit these obligations to be satisfied by having Intel withhold a portion of the shares of the Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to you upon exercise of the option, or to the extent permitted by the Committee, by tendering shares of the Common Stock previously acquired. 12. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION You may not assign or transfer this option to anyone except pursuant to your will or upon your death to your beneficiaries. The transferability of options is subject to any applicable laws of your country of residence or employment. 13. DISPUTES
The Committee or its delegate shall finally and conclusively determine any disagreement concerning your option. 14. AMENDMENTS The 2006 Plan and the option may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of Intel to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan. 15. DATA PRIVACY You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this document by the Corporation for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan.

You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the 2006 Plan.
