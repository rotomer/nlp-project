On March 27, 2007, Intel received written notification from the IRS that it has closed its examination of the company's tax returns for the years 1999 to 2002, resolving a number of issues, including the tax benefit for export sales. Additionally, resolution was reached with respect to the tax benefit for export sales for the years 2003 through 2005.
In connection with the settlement, the company expects to reverse previously accrued taxes which will reduce the current quarter's tax provision by approximately $275 million and reduce the income tax rate for 2007 below the previous forecast of approximately 30%.
See "Legal Proceedings" in Part I, Item 3 and "Note 19: Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of the 2006 Form 10-K for further information concerning the tax benefit for export sales.
