Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein is financial information for Intel Corporation for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 and forward-looking statements relating to 2007 and the second quarter of 2007 as presented in a press release of April 17, 2007. Also included in Exhibit 99.1 under the heading "Supplemental Operating Results and Other Information" is certain unaudited annual and quarterly financial information for the Digital Enterprise Group, Mobility Group, Flash Memory Group, and "all other" category. In the first quarter of 2007, the company began allocating share-based compensation to the operating segments, and results have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change as well as certain other minor reorganizations. The allocation of share-based compensation to the operating segments does not in any way restate or revise the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Intel Corporation as set forth in any previously reported consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of income or consolidated statement of cash flows of the company. This information is provided as supplemental financial information that may be of interest to Intel Corporation stockholders. The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement heretofore or hereafter filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the extent that such information is superseded by information as of a subsequent date that is included in or incorporated by reference into such registration statement. The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Item 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE In connection with the company's ongoing program designed to improve operational efficiency and results, the company previously announced that it had determined on August 30, 2006 to undertake a number of additional actions recommended by the company's Structure and Efficiency Taskforce relating to organizational efficiency, business processes and programs (collectively, the "Efficiency Plan"). The company recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $75 million in the first quarter of 2007. Previously, Intel Corporation approved a plan to place for sale its fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The assets subject to this impairment were principally used in support of the communications and application processor business. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded non-cash land, building and equipment write-downs of approximately $214 million. As a result of softer than anticipated market conditions, in the first quarter of 2007, the company recorded additional non-cash write-downs of approximately $54 million. The company currently expects to incur additional charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements of approximately $60 million in the second quarter of 2007, which includes the impacts of our ongoing Efficiency Plan and expected severance charges related to the Colorado Springs facility. For the employees at the Colorado Springs facility, plans regarding employee termination benefits will depend in part on the terms of any sales transaction regarding the facility. The exact timing of charges from employee severance and benefit arrangements and the related cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, has not been finalized. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works councils as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors including the salary, position and number of years of service of the affected employees as well as the type and amount of severance benefits offered to employees. 2
Additional, presently undetermined, charges related to the Efficiency Plan may be incurred in the remainder of 2007 and 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. Additional details will be provided in the company's earnings releases and Business Outlook statements published quarterly in such fiscal years. The Efficiency Plan reflects the Corporation's intention only. This Form 8-K and attached press release contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In addition to the factors addressed in the attached press release relating to forward looking statements made in the press release, many factors could affect the planned sale of the Colorado Springs facility, the Efficiency Plan and the company's actual results, and if the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of the company may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any to any projections of charges or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, including the timing and execution of the planned sale of the Colorado Springs facility or any restructuring plan; benefit program changes and the extent of employees impacted by planned sale of the Colorado Springs facility or the restructuring; and any statements or assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the extent or timing of cost savings, use of cost savings, revenue or profitability improvements, or other financial items; any statements concerning the company's expected competitive position or performance; any statements of expectation or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Intel presently considers the factors set forth below to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's published expectations: risks, uncertainties and assumptions including the timing and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works councils; assumptions related to severance and post-retirement costs; future acquisitions, dispositions, investments, new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development and manufacturing which may affect expense and employment levels at the company; assumptions relating to product demand and the business environment; and other risk factors that are described from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including but not limited to the risk factors described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2006. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 3

Exhibit 99.1 Intel First-Quarter Revenue $8.9 Billion Operating Income $1.7 Billion, EPS 27 Cents SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2007--Intel Corporation today announced first-quarter revenue of $8.9 billion, operating income of $1.7 billion, net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents. The results included the effect of a $300-million reversal of previously accrued taxes that increased EPS by approximately 5 cents. "The strong momentum of our industry-leading Intel(R) Core(TM) microarchitecture product family, combined with ongoing structural cost improvements, delivered solid financial results in the first quarter," said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini. "Our product strength is reflected in the fact that average selling prices for the quarter held up well in a very competitive environment." Q1 2007 vs. Q1 2006 vs. Q4 2006 - ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ---------------- Revenue $8.9 billion -1% -9% - ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ---------------- Operating Income $1.7 billion -3% +13% - ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ---------------- Net Income $1.6 billion +19% +7% - ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ---------------- EPS 27 cents +17% +4% - ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ---------------- Results for the first quarter of 2007 included a tax item that increased EPS by approximately 5 cents. Results for the fourth quarter of 2006 included the effects of a gain as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges that together increased EPS by approximately 1 cent. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial and Key Product Trends -- First-quarter gross margin was 50.1 percent, higher than 49.6 percent in the previous quarter as lower microprocessor unit costs and the sale of previously reserved inventory more than offset the effects of higher 45 nanometer (nm) start-up costs and lower revenue. -- The company reached its goal of reducing the workforce to approximately 92,000 people, meeting the target one quarter ahead of schedule. -- Total microprocessor units were lower sequentially. The ASP was slightly lower driven by a lower mix within server processors, with desktop and mobile ASPs approximately flat. -- Chipset, motherboard and flash memory units were lower sequentially. Business Outlook The following expectations do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be completed after April 16. Q2 2007 Outlook -- Revenue: Expected to be between $8.2 billion and $8.8 billion. -- Gross margin: 48 percent plus or minus a couple of points. -- Spending (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. In addition, the company expects a second-quarter restructuring charge of approximately $60 million. -- Net gains from equity investments and interest and other: Approximately $150 million. -- Tax rate: Approximately 31 percent. -- Depreciation: Between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. 2007 Outlook -- Gross margin: 51 percent plus or minus a few points, higher than the previous expectation of 50 percent plus or minus a few points. -- R&D: Approximately $5.6 billion, higher than the previous expectation of approximately $5.4 billion. -- MG&A: Approximately $5.1 billion, lower than the previous expectation of approximately $5.3 billion. -- Capital spending: $5.5 billion plus or minus $200 million, unchanged. -- Tax rate: Approximately 31 percent in the third and fourth quarters. The previous expectation was approximately 30 percent for the year. -- Depreciation: $4.8 billion plus or minus $100 million, unchanged. The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans and expectations for the second quarter, the year and the future are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the factors set forth below in the section entitled "Risk Factors" to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Corporation's published expectations. Recent Events -- Intel announced that its upcoming 45nm transistor technology is based on breakthrough Hi-K metal gate transistor materials that increase performance and reduce leakage, enabling faster and more energy-efficient microprocessors. The company announced that fifteen 45nm microprocessors are in development and demonstrated pre-production desktop, mobile and server platforms running five operating systems, with shipments scheduled to begin in the second half of 2007. -- Intel announced that Fab 11X in Rio Rancho, New Mexico will be re-tooled to become the company's fourth 300mm factory capable of producing 45nm microprocessors. Intel also announced plans to build a 300mm factory in China, with production to begin in 2010. -- Intel expanded its quad-core microprocessor line-up to include its first 50-watt quad-core server processors, first quad-core processors for embedded designs, and fastest-ever quad-core processors for extreme gaming and digital design. The company has now introduced 12 quad-core processors for use in computing, storage and embedded applications. -- Intel and Sun Microsystems announced a broad strategic alliance that will result in Sun delivering a comprehensive family of enterprise and telecommunications servers and workstations based on Intel(R) Xeon(R) processors, with Intel supporting Solaris(1) as a mainstream operating system. -- The company's Intel(R) vPro(TM) processor technology, which brings manageability and security benefits to IT managers, has been deployed by more than 200 companies and institutions including 3M, BMW, FujiFilm, ING, Johns Hopkins, Pioneer and Verizon. -- The company introduced the Intel(R) Centrino(R) Pro processor technology brand, with plans to bring more of the security and manageability capabilities of Intel's business desktop platforms to notebook PCs. -- The company introduced Wi-Fi connections based on the new 802.11n specification that will give future users of Intel(R) Centrino(R) processor technology up to five times the Wi-Fi performance and twice the range of earlier technologies. -- The company announced shipments of Intel-powered "classmate PCs," bringing affordable mobile computing to K-12 students in Brazil and Mexico, with plans for pilot programs in 25 countries. -- Intel announced "solid-state drive" products that use Intel NAND flash chips as an alternative to rotating magnetic disk drive technology. -- Intel researchers developed an 80-core "tera-scale" processor that brings supercomputer-like performance to a single chip. The experimental processor may lead to future Intel products bringing trillions of calculations per second to PCs and servers. Risk Factors -- Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing pressures, and product demand that is highly variable and difficult to forecast. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the timing of new Intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's competitors, including product offerings, marketing programs and pricing pressures and Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into its products; and the availability of sufficient components from suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could cause demand to be different from Intel's expectations include customer acceptance of Intel and competitors' products; changes in customer order patterns, including order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers; and changes in business and economic conditions. -- The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations based on changes in revenue levels; product mix and pricing; capacity utilization; variations in inventory valuation; excess or obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs; impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up costs. -- Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products, the level of revenue and profits and impairments of long-lived assets. -- Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency program that is resulting in several actions that could have an impact on expected expense levels and gross margin. -- The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. -- Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities; gains or losses from equity method investments; impairment charges related to marketable, non-marketable and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. -- Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees. -- Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in the countries in which Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. -- Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 30, 2006. Status of Business Outlook During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business on June 1 until publication of the company's second-quarter 2007 earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the company. Earnings Webcast Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today on its Investor Relations Web site at www.intc.com, with a replay available until May 1.
