STACY J. SMITH NAMED INTEL CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Andy Bryant to Become Chief Administrative Officer
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 16, 2007  Intel Corporation today announced that Stacy J. Smith has been appointed chief financial officer (CFO), succeeding Andy Bryant in the role. Bryant has been chief financial and enterprise services officer since 1998 and Intel's CFO for 13 years. Smith will continue to report to Bryant, who was named to the new position of chief administrative officer.
Smith, 44, has served as assistant CFO for 18 months, managing Intel's financial operations alongside Bryant during that time. His appointment to CFO, effective immediately, is part of the company's long-term succession planning process.
Bryant joined Intel in 1981 and became CFO in 1994. In his long tenure as CFO, Bryant earned the highest level of trust with global investors and employees, while steering financial and other business operations at Intel with a steady hand.
"Andy Bryant is one of the most respected financial officers in the world," said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. "His credibility is unmatched and is one of the factors that has served Intel exceptionally well through the years, gaining him many admirers inside and outside the company. I am extremely pleased that we will be able to focus Andy on a broader set of tasks within the company while giving Stacy more responsibility."
