Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Item 7.01 Regulation FD
 
On October 22, 2007, Intel and Transmeta Corporation entered into a settlement agreement that resolves the patent infringement cases between the parties and provides certain rights for Intel and its customers.  Pursuant to the agreement, Intel and its customers will receive a broad license to all Transmeta patents and patent applications now existing or as may be filed during the next ten years, including any patent rights acquired by Transmeta. Transmeta will also transfer technology and grant to Intel a non-exclusive license to Transmeta's LongRun and LongRun2 technologies and future improvements. In addition, Intel will receive a general release from all claims of any type.  In exchange, Intel will make an initial payment of $150 million to Transmeta and five annual payments of $20 million each beginning one year from the date of the settlement, for total payments of $250 million.  The settlement also includes a covenant by Intel not to sue Transmeta for certain licensing to third parties and Intel and Transmeta agreed to dismiss all litigation between the parties.  Intel expects to finalize the accounting treatment related to the settlement by the time of the filing of its third-quarter Form 10-Q.  However, Intel expects some portion of the $250 million, expected to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million, to be recorded as a third-quarter expense to cost of sales, reducing previously announced earnings for the third quarter of 2007, with the remainder to be reflected as an intangible asset that will be amortized over future periods.
