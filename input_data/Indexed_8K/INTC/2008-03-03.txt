INTEL LOWERS FIRST-QUARTER GROSS MARGIN FORECAST
DUE TO LOWER NAND FLASH MEMORY PRICES
 
All Other Business Expectations Unchanged
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 3, 2008 -- Intel Corporation today lowered its first-quarter gross margin forecast to 54 percent, plus or minus a point, as compared to the previous forecast of 56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, due to lower than expected prices for NAND flash memory chips. All other expectations are consistent with the first-quarter Business Outlook published in the company's fourth quarter 2007 earnings release, available at
www.intc.com
.
 
Status of Business Outlook
During the remainder of the week, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business on March 7 until publication of the company's first-quarter 2008 earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to an update by the company.
