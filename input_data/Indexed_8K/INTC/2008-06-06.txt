Ruling of the Korea Fair Trade Commission.
 The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has ruled that Intel Corporation (Intel") has violated Korean antitrust laws on two counts of "abuse of dominance."  The Commission fined Intel approximately $25.4 million (26 billion Korean won).  Intel representatives have stated that the company is extremely disappointed by the decision of the KFTC and believes that the ruling represents an outcome that will dampen, not enhance, the price competition that has resulted in lower prices for customers and consumers. 
The company will review the ruling and it is presently expected that Intel will request a further review from the KFTC and, if it proves necessary, an appeal which will permit a Korean court to review the case in its entirety and reach its own decision in the matter. 
U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein is a press release of Intel Corporation announcing that Intel has received a subpoena from the United States Federal Trade Commission related to Intel's business practices with respect to competition in the microprocessor market.

The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement heretofore or hereafter filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the extent that such information is superseded by information as of a subsequent date that is included in or incorporated by reference into such registration statement.

INTEL STATEMENT ON U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 6, 2008  Intel Corporation today issued the following statement in response to the issuance of a subpoena from the United States Federal Trade Commission (U.S. FTC):
On June 4 the U.S. FTC served a subpoena related to Intel's business practices with respect to competition in the microprocessor market. Since 2006 Intel has been working closely with the FTC on an informal inquiry into competition in the microprocessor market and has provided the commission staff with a considerable amount of information and thousands of documents. By proceeding to a subpoena, the Commission will be able to obtain not only information that Intel has already committed to provide but also information from other parties.  Consistent with its standard practice Intel will work cooperatively with the FTC staff to comply with the subpoena and continue providing information. 
The company believes its business practices are well within U.S. law. The evidence that this industry is fiercely competitive and working is compelling. For example, prices for microprocessors declined by 42.4 percent from 2000 to end of 2007. When competitors perform and execute the market rewards them. When they falter and under-perform the market responds accordingly.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the world leader in silicon innovation, develops technologies, products and initiatives to continually advance how people work and live. Additional
