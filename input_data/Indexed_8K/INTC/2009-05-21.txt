On May 20, 2009, stockholders of Intel Corporation ("Intel") approved the amendment and extension of the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the "Plan") to: (1) extend the term of the Plan to June 30, 2012, (2) authorize an additional 134 million shares for a total authorization of 428 million shares of Intel common stock for issuance under the Plan, and (3) authorize up to an additional 235,000,000 shares of Intel common stock for use only to the extent required if Intel implements a stock option exchange program as described in its 2009 Proxy Statement.
The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to eligible full-time and part-time employees and non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors ("Board") determines which employees will participate in the Plan, as well as the terms of employee grants, and the Board determines the terms of grants to non-employee directors. The Committee has delegated authority to a committee consisting of the CEO to grant awards to non-executive employees within limits and a budget pre-approved by the Committee. An aggregate of 428 million shares have been authorized for issuance as awards over the term of the Plan and up to an additional 235,000,000 shares have been authorized for use only to the extent required if Intel implements a stock option exchange program, subject in each case to adjustment only to reflect stock splits and similar events.
Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the Plan may not have a term longer than seven years, except that up to 10 million shares may be used for long-term executive retention stock option grants having a term no longer than 10 years. No more than 253 million shares may be issued as restricted stock or RSU awards under the Plan. Within these 253 million shares of restricted stock or RSUs, up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares may be issued under the Plan as employee recognition stock awards having no minimum vesting period. The Plan limits awards to any employee participant in any single calendar year to no more than 3 million shares subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and no more than 2 million shares subject to restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards. No more than 30,000 shares may be subject to awards granted to any non-employee director in a single calendar year. Awards under the Plan may be conditioned on continued employment, the passage of time or the satisfaction of performance vesting criteria, which criteria may be based on financial and business performance criteria. Vesting requirements are determined by the Committee, provided, however, that stock options and stock appreciation rights shall not first become exercisable in less than one year and restricted stock or restricted stock units shall not vest in less than pro rata installments over three years, unless vesting is based on the achievement of performance criteria, in which case such performance vesting criteria may not be based on a period of less than one year. The company will not without stockholder approval reduce the purchase price exchange or cash out a stock option or SAR when the purchase price of the stock option or SAR is above the market value of the company's common stock.
The foregoing summary description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. For additional information regarding the Plan, refer to Proposal 3 (Approval of Amendment and Extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan) on pages 50-58 of Intel's 2009 Proxy Statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.
On May 19, 2009, Intel's Board approved amendments to the company's Bylaws, effective immediately, to allow for the election by the Board of a non-employee Chairman of the Board, and to make other conforming changes. Therefore, Article III, Directors and Article IV, Officers, among others, have been revised accordingly.
The preceding is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Intel's Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.

If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder; (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.
 
 
 
Section 2
.        
Annual Meetings
. The annual meetings of the stockholders of the corporation for the purpose of election of directors, and for such other business as may lawfully come before them, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, but in no event more than fifteen (15) months after the date of the preceding annual meeting.
(a)       Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors at any time.
(b)       Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation shall be called by the Board of Directors upon written request to the Secretary of the corporation of one or more stockholders representing in the aggregate not less than twenty five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. A request to the Secretary of the corporation shall be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent of such stockholder, requesting the special meeting and shall be accompanied by a notice setting forth the information required by paragraph (c) of Section 8 of this Article as to the business proposed to be conducted and any nominations proposed to be presented at such special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) proposing such business or nominations, and by a representation by the stockholder(s) that within five (5) business days after the record date for any such special meeting it will provide such information as of the record date for such special meeting. A special meeting requested by stockholders shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall not be more than ninety (90) days after the request to call the special meeting is received by the Secretary of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by stockholders shall not be held if either (a) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held within ninety (90) days after the Secretary of the corporation receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the request or (b) an annual or special meeting that included the business specified in the request (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) was held not more than ninety (90) days before the request to call the special meeting was received by the Secretary of the corporation. A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, and if, following such revocation, there are unrevoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of shares entitling the stockholders to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by stockholders shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the request for meeting, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the authority in its discretion to submit additional matters to the stockholders, and to cause other business to be transacted, at any special meeting requested by stockholders.
 
 
 
(c)       Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any other business brought before a special meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, and, if any nomination or other business is not in compliance with this section (including if the stockholder does not provide the information that it represents it will provide under this section to the corporation within five business days following the record date for the meeting), to declare that such defective nomination or proposal shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matters may have been received.
(a)       Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice (as the term written is defined in Article XII hereof) of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting; the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to the stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article X hereof. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the householding rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).
(b)       If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 262(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section.
(c)       When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
(d)       Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.
(e)       Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given.
 
 
 
(a)       At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares, the voting of which at said meeting have been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at said meeting. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
(b)       Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation.
(a)       Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two (2) or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one (1) of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum.
(b)       Every person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
Section 7.
        
List of Stockholders.
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list
 
 
 
available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
(a)       Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business other than nominations to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (i) pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving the notice provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section.
(b)       In order to assure that stockholders and the corporation have a reasonable opportunity to consider nominations and other business proposed to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and to allow for full information to be distributed to stockholders, a stockholder properly may bring nominations or other business before an annual meeting of stockholders only if the stockholder shall have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, and such other business must be a proper subject for stockholder action under the Delaware General Corporation Law. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholders notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the companys most recent proxy statement) not later than the close of business on the forty-fifth (45th) day nor earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary of the date on which the corporation filed its definitive proxy materials (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the prior years annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed (other than as a result of adjournment) by more than thirty (30) days from the anniversary of the previous years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

(d)       The requirements of this Section 8 shall not apply to a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a non-binding (precatory) stockholder proposal at an annual meeting pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. With respect to any other matter proposed to be presented pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8, (i) the notice required by this Section 8 shall be considered timely if delivered within the time period specified in Rule 14a-8(e), and (ii) the person proposing to have such matter presented at the meeting shall provide the information required by paragraph (c) of this Section, provided that the information required by paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section 8 may be satisfied by providing the information required pursuant to Rule 14a-8(b).
(e)       Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the nominees are named in the special meeting request delivered pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 3 of this Article II or, at any special meeting called pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 3 hereof, if the stockholders notice required by this section is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (if delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholders notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the companys most recent proxy statement) not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th)
 
 
 
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and such notice sets forth the information required by paragraph (c) of this section. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
(f)        Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Only such other business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The Chairman of the Board of Directors or Secretary may, if the facts warrant, determine that a notice received by the corporation relating to a nomination proposed to be made or an item of business proposed to be introduced at a meeting of stockholders does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 8 (including if the stockholder does not provide the information required under Section 8(c)(iii)(B) and 8(c)(iv)(A)-(C) to the corporation within five business days following the record date for the meeting), and if it be so determined, shall so declare and any such nomination or other business shall not be introduced at such meeting of stockholders, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matters may have been received. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any other business brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, and, if any nomination or other business is not in compliance with this section (including if the stockholder does not provide the information required under Section 8(c)(iii)(B) and 8(c)(iv)(A)-(C) to the corporation within five business days following the record date for the meeting), to declare that such defective nomination or proposal shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matters may have been received. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) is not present at the meeting of stockholders to make a nomination or propose such business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this section, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to the corporation prior to the making of such nomination or proposal at such meeting by such stockholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
(g)       For purposes of this section, public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. For purposes of paragraph (c)(iv)(A) of this Section 8, the term associate shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 14a-1(a) under the Exchange Act and shares shall be treated as beneficially owned by a person if the person (i) beneficially owns such shares, directly or indirectly, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulations 13D and 13G thereunder, or (ii) has or shares pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing) (A) the right to acquire such shares (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or the fulfillment of a condition or both), (B) the right to vote such shares, alone or in concert with
 
 
 
others, and/or (C) investment power with respect to such shares, including the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, such shares.
(h)       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this section.
ARTICLE III
Directors
Section 1
.        
Number and Term of Office
. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than nine (9) nor more than fifteen (15), the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such range by a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors. This range shall not be altered without stockholder approval. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has established procedures under which any director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. Directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. If, for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.
Section 2
.        
Powers
. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.
Section 3
.

indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto) against all expenses, liability, and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed on any Agent as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any Proceeding (hereinafter Expenses); provided, however, that except as to actions to enforce indemnification rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Article, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right.
Section 2
.        
Authority to Advance Expenses
. Expenses incurred by an officer of director (acting in his capacity as such) in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, provided, however, that if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, such Expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article or otherwise. Expenses incurred by other Agents of the corporation (or by the directors or officers not acting in their capacity as such, including service with respect to employee benefit plans) may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

Section 3

Right of Claimant to Bring Suit

It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met
 
 
 
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 4
.        
Provisions Nonexclusive
. The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. To the extent that any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, or vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws, the provision, agreement, or vote shall take precedence.
Section 5

address as shown by the stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
(b)       Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method hereinabove stated. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one (1) permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
(c)       If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof. An affidavit executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and post office address or the names and post office addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same (or, for any stockholder or director to whom notice has been directed by electronic transmission, the form of electronic transmission and the facsimile number, electronic mail address or other location to which such notice was directed and the time at which such notice was directed to each such director or stockholder), shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained.
(d)       All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

(e)       The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him
 
 
 
in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice.
(f)        Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing given by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
(g)       Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
(h)       Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation.

The Corporation shall not be required to register in a Participant's name or deliver any Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such Shares under any federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable. To the extent the Corporation is unable to or the Committee deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Corporation's counsel to be necessary or advisable for the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Corporation shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. No Stock Option shall be exercisable and no Shares shall be issued and/or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Shares underlying such Stock Option is effective and current or the Corporation has determined that such registration is unnecessary.
