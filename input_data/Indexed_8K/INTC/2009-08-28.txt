Intel Raises Third-Quarter Revenue and Gross Margin Expectations
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 28, 2009  As a result of stronger than expected demand for microprocessors and chipsets, Intel Corporation now expects revenue for the third quarter to be $9.0 billion, plus or minus $200 million, as compared to the previous range of $8.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million.
            
The gross margin percentage for the third quarter is expected to be in the upper half of the previous range of 53 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. All other expectations are unchanged.
          Intels third-quarter Business Outlook was originally published in the companys second-quarter 2009 earnings release, available at intc.com. The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results on Oct. 13.
Status of Business Outlook
          Through Aug. 31, Intels corporate representatives may reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business on Aug. 31 until publication of the companys third-quarter earnings release, Intel will observe a Quiet Period during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the companys press releases and filings with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to an update by the company.
