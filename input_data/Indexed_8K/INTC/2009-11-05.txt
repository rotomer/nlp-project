Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 4, 2009, the State of New York by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo filed a lawsuit against Intel in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  The lawsuit alleges that Intel has violated the federal antitrust laws, the New York Donnelly Act (N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law  340 et seq.), and  63(12) of the New York Executive Law.  The lawsuit alleges that Intel has engaged in a worldwide campaign of illegal, exclusionary conduct to maintain Intel's alleged monopoly power and prices in the market for x86 microprocessors.  The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in an amount to be proven at trial, trebled as provided for by law, restitution, disgorgement, an injunction to prevent further alleged unlawful acts, $1,000,000 for each violation of the Donnelly Act proven by the plaintiff, and attorneys' fees and costs.  Intel strongly disagrees with the plaintiff's allegations and claims, and intends to conduct a vigorous defense of the lawsuit.
