Item 7.01                      Regulation FD Disclosure
The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Intel Corporation (Intel) holds an equity interest in SMART Technologies, Inc. (SMART). On July 15, 2010 SMART completed an initial public offering of shares approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Intel sold approximately 10 million of its 27.5 million shares in the secondary offering.  As a result of this sale, Intel has revised its third-quarter Business Outlook with respect to equity investments and interest and other.  Intel now expects the third quarter impact of equity investments and interest and other to be a gain of approximately $175 million as compared to the previous expectation of approximately zero. All other expectations are unchanged.
The underwriters to the initial public offering have a 30-day option to purchase up to 5.8 million additional shares at $17 per share from shareholders existing prior to the initial public offering.  Intel may sell up to an additional 1.9 million shares if the option is exercised.
Intels third-quarter Business Outlook was originally published in the companys second-quarter 2010 earnings release, available at intc.com. The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results on October 12.
Risk Factors
The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans and expectations for the third quarter, the year and the future are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intels actual results, and variances from Intels current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the following to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the corporations expectations.
A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect Intels results is included in Intels SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Mar. 27, 2010.
