The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has entered an order extending by two weeks the temporary withdrawal of its case against Intel Corporation (Intel) from adjudication to allow the Commission more time to consider a proposed settlement.

There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in a settlement of the administrative trial proceedings.
