Summary
We achieved record quarterly revenue of $11.1B despite a weaker than expected consumer market segment.  Demand strength in emerging markets and a robust enterprise market segment led to record microprocessor units.  This unit demand in combination with the leadership that we have across our product portfolio and low platform unit costs led to gross margin of 66% and a quarterly record for operating income of $4.1B.  Net income of $3.0B was up 59% from a year ago and earnings per share of $0.52 was up 58% from a year ago. The strength of our business model and execution can be seen in two metrics; operating profit as a percent of revenue was the highest in over 10 years at 37.3%, and quarterly revenue per employee was at an all-time high of $136k.
Revenue
Revenue of $11.1B was up 3% sequentially versus an average seasonal increase of approximately 9%. Microprocessor average selling prices, both including and excluding Intel Atom processors, were approximately flat to the second quarter.  The enterprise market segment remained strong as the corporate refresh continues.  Customers continued to manage inventory to healthy levels.  The Americas performed seasonally while all other geographies performed worse than seasonal. On a year-over-year basis, revenue for the third quarter was up 18%.
Intel architecture group revenue of $10.7B was up 3.5%:
Intel Atom microarchitecture revenue, including microprocessors and associated chipsets, was $396M, down 4% from the second quarter.

Gross Margin
Gross margin dollars were $7.3B, 1% higher than the second quarter.  Gross margin of 65.9% was 1.3 points lower than the second quarter and flat to the midpoint of the Outlook provided in August.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q210 to Q310 (67.2% to 65.9%, down 1.3 points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
The midpoint of the forecast ranges will be referred to when making comparisons to specific periods.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q310 Outlook provided in July to Q310 (67% +/- couple points to 65.9%, down 1.1 points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
In a year-over-year comparison, gross margin percent is 8 points higher than Q309.  The increase is primarily due to higher platform** average selling prices, lower platform** unit cost, no excess capacity charges in Q310, and higher platform** volume.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A was $3.2B, down 2% from the second quarter and in line with the Outlook provided.  Spending as a percentage of revenue was 29%, down 1 point from the first and second quarters.  Depreciation was in line with expectations at $1.1B.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net gain of $115M, lower than the $204M gain in the second quarter and lower than our revised Outlook of a $175M net gain.  Relative to our revised Outlook, the third quarter was lower primarily due to mark to market losses on Micron stock acquired through the sale of our stake in Numonyx.
The provision for taxes in the third quarter was at a 30.5% tax rate, lower than the forecast of 32% due to lower reserves and higher profits coming from low tax jurisdictions.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was over $3.5B. On the balance sheet, total cash investments^^ ended the quarter at $20.3B, $2.5B higher than the second quarter.  During the third quarter, we paid $877M in dividends, purchased $1.4B in capital assets, and increased total inventories by $78M (all on 32nm products).
Other Items
We added approximately 1,300 employees in the third quarter bringing the number of employees to 81.7k.
** CPU and chipset, excluding Intel Atom microprocessors and chipsets
^^ Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in

Q4 2010 Outlook
The Outlook for the fourth quarter does not include the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions (such as McAfee and the wireless division of Infineon) that may be completed after October 12th. The mid-point of the forecast ranges will be referred to when making comparisons to specific periods.
Revenue
Revenue is expected to be $11.4B, plus or minus $400M in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 3% from the third quarter, which is below the average seasonal increase of 8% due to continuing consumer softness and customers reducing inventory in advance of the Sandy Bridge launch in Q111.
Gross Margin
Gross margin in the third quarter is expected to be 67%, plus or minus a couple points.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q310 to Q410 Outlook (65.9% to 67% +/- a couple points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $3.2B, flat to the third quarter.  Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.1B, also flat to the third quarter.
Other Income Statement Items
