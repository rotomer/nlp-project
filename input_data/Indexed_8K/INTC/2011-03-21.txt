Item 7.01                      Regulation FD Disclosure.
On March 16, 2011, Intel Corporation presented additional financial information with respect to its McAfee, Inc. subsidiary for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 at an investor meeting in New York. McAfees 2011 revenue is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, after a reduction to McAfees deferred revenue balance of $300 million due to purchase accounting. The impact of deferred revenue in 2012 is estimated to be approximately $100 million. In 2011, the amortization of intangibles relating to McAfee is estimated to be approximately $450 million, with approximately 60% relating to cost of sales, and 40% relating to operating expense. Charges related to the amortization of intangibles are expected to continue for a number of years. We expect McAfees financial performance to be slightly dilutive to Intels earnings in 2011 and accretive in 2012 and beyond. Excluding the purchase accounting write-down of deferred revenue and the amortization of acquired intangibles, McAfees financial performance is expected to be slightly accretive to Intels earnings in 2011 and beyond.
