Summary
The first quarter of 2011 had several significant milestones. It was a record quarter in terms of revenue and earnings per share. We closed both the McAfee, Inc. and Infineon wireless division acquisitions. We launched Sandy Bridge, our fastest ramping product in the companys history, helping to increase platform** average selling prices for the sixth consecutive quarter. In addition, the company identified, fixed, and recovered from the Cougar Point chipset design issue without a revenue impact.
As a result of the acquisition of McAfee, Inc. and the Infineon wireless division, we will be providing Non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into operational results of the company. Excluding the impacts of deferred revenue write-down and associated costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other acquisition-related accounting impacts, the first quarter results when compared to the fourth quarter were the following:
           Revenue of $12.9B* was up 12% from $11.5B
           Gross Margin of 62.3%* was down 2.5 points
           Net income of $3.3B* was up 3% from $3.2B*
           Earnings per share of $0.59* was up 5% from $0.56*
Except otherwise noted, the remainder of this document will represent results and comparables on a GAAP basis.
Record revenue of $12.8B, was up $1.4B and 12% sequentially, and $2.5B and 25% year-on-year. The acquisition of McAfee and the Infineon wireless division contributed approximately $500M to our revenue in the first quarter.   We continue to benefit from demand strength in the enterprise and emerging market segments, despite softness in the consumer market segments of the U.S. and Western Europe. The server business exceeded our expectations as strong demand from the data center segment continued. The strength of our new Sandy Bridge product ramp drove a richer mix of products resulting in an increase in average selling prices when compared to the fourth quarter. Gross margin dollars of $7.9B was an all time record with gross margin percent at 61%. R&D and MG&A as a percent of revenue dropped to 28.7%. Operating profit of $4.2B is up 3% sequentially and 21% from a year ago. Net income of $3.2B and earnings per share of $0.56 were up 29% and 30% respectively from a year ago.

Revenue
Revenue of $12.8B was up 12% sequentially versus an average historical decline of 8% and was above our expectations. The first quarter included an extra week of revenue and revenue from the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon wireless division. Platform** average selling prices were up slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Inventory levels across the supply chain remained healthy as customers burned through older generation inventory and replenished it with our new Sandy Bridge platforms. On a year-over-year basis, revenue for the first quarter was up 25%.
Intel Architecture Group first quarter revenue of $12.2B was up 11% sequentially and 23% year over year:
The Software and Services Group had revenue of $240M, up 220% from the fourth quarter. Year over year, the Software and Services Group revenue was up 314%. The McAfee, Inc. acquisition closed on February 28, 2011 and contributed $160M to the first quarter 2011 revenue.
Intel Atom microarchitecture revenue, including microprocessors and associated chipsets, was $370M, down 5% from the fourth quarter and up 4% from the first quarter of 2010.
Gross Margin
Gross margin dollars were $7.9B, $0.5B higher than the fourth quarter.  Gross margin of 61.4% was 3.2 points lower than the fourth quarter and up 0.4 points compared to the midpoint of the revised Outlook provided on January 31.
st
Q410 gross margin percentage was initially reported at Q4 earnings on January 13 as 67.5%.  On January 31 we estimated the impact of the Cougar Point chipset issue on Q4 gross margin to be approximately 4 points, taking expected gross margin for Q4 to 63.5%.  Q410 actual gross margin as reported in our Form 10-K was 64.6% as 1 point of the Cougar Point gross margin impact shifted from Q410 to Q111.

[note: point attributions are approximate]
 
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q111 Revised Outlook provided on January 31st to Q111 (61% +/- couple points to 61.4%, up 0.4 point)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
In a year-over-year comparison, gross margin percent for Q111 is 2 points lower than Q110.  The decrease is primarily due to the Cougar Point issue, higher start up costs, and acquisition related impacts offset partially  by improvements in our platform** business.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A was $3.7B, up 9% from the fourth quarter and $100M higher than the Outlook provided on January 31. The increase from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by acquisitions and the salary expenses related to the extra week in the first quarter. R&D and MG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.7%, down from the fourth quarter.  Depreciation was $1.3B, slightly up versus expectations.
st
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net gain of $213M, higher than the $140M gain in the fourth quarter and consistent with our Outlook of a $200M net gain.  Relative to the fourth quarter, the first quarter was higher due to the sale of the Digital Health Group to create the Intel-GE joint venture, Care Innovations.
The provision for taxes in the first quarter was at a 27.7% tax rate, in line with our forecast of 29%.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was over $4.0B.  On the balance sheet, total cash investments^^ ended the quarter at $11.5B, $10.0B lower than the fourth quarter.  During the first quarter, we purchased McAfee, Inc. and the Infineon wireless division, paid approximately $1.0B in dividends, purchased $2.7B in capital assets, and repurchased $4.0B in stock.  Total inventories increased by approximately $350M.

The inventory increase was driven by the following: Approximately a third of the increase was the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of the Infineon wireless division. Approximately a third of the increase was driven by putting additional raw materials inventory in place given uncertainty of the supply chain impact of the Japan earthquake.  Approximately a third of the increase was driven by additional CPU inventory as we ramp Sandy Bridge. Sandy Bridge now accounts for approximately half of our CPU inventory.
Other Items
We added approximately 11k employees in the first quarter, primarily through acquisitions, bringing the number of employees to 93.5k.
Diluted shares outstanding decreased by 92M shares to 5.6B shares driven by fourth quarter and first quarter share repurchases. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated based on a weighted average of shares outstanding during the quarter. As a result, only a portion of the $4.0B of first quarter share repurchases are reflected in our first quarter weighting for diluted shares outstanding and the full impact will be included in our second quarter diluted shares outstanding.
Q2 2011 Outlook
The outlook for the second quarter does not include the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after April 19th. The mid-point of the forecast ranges will be referred to when making comparisons to specific periods.
Revenue
Revenue is expected to be $12.8B, plus or minus $500M in the second quarter. The midpoint of this range would be flat from the first quarter, which is inside the normal seasonal range. When comparing to historical seasonality, the impact for the extra week in the first quarter will not repeat and the acquisition impact in the second quarter will roughly double. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding certain acquisition related accounting impacts, the revenue forecast is $12.85B, plus or minus $500M in the second quarter.
Gross Margin
Gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be 61%, plus or minus a couple points.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q111 to Q211 Outlook (61.4% to 61% +/- a couple points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding certain accounting impacts and expenses related to acquisitions, primarily the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, Q211 gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 62% +/- a couple points.
** CPU and chipset, excluding Intel Atom microprocessors and chipsets

Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $3.9B, up approximately $200M from the first quarter, primarily driven by the impact of a full quarter of McAfee, Inc. and Infineon wireless division acquisition spending.  Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.2B, down slightly from the first quarter.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is forecasted to be approximately $75M.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income are expected to be a net gain of approximately $50M, down from $213M in the first quarter.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Inventory is expected to be roughly flat in Q2.
2011 Outlook
The Outlook for full year 2011 does not include the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after April 19.
th
Gross Margin
Gross margin for the year is still expected to be 63%, plus or minus a few points.  On Non-GAAP basis, excluding certain accounting impacts and expenses related to acquisitions, primarily the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, the gross margin forecast for the year is expected to be 64% plus or minus a few points.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A for the year is still expected to be $15.7B, plus or minus $200M.
Amortization of acquisition related intangibles is forecasted to be approximately $260M for 2011.
Depreciation for the year is still expected to be approximately $5.0B +/- $100M.
Other Income Statement Items
The tax rate for each of the remaining quarters of 2011 is expected to be 29%, in line with previous expectations.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Capital spending for 2011 is forecasted to be $10.2B plus or minus $400M, $1.2B higher than our previous expectations.  The capital spending increase is driven by both the unit growth and the product mix we are seeing and protects our ability to build to our forecast of future demand levels. Additionally, this capital spending enables our strategy to integrate more features and functionality on leading edge process technology which results in performance, cost and power efficiency advantages.
