SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 11, 2011  Intel Corporation today announced that its board of directors has approved a 16 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share (84 cents per share on an annual basis), beginning with the dividend that will be declared in the third quarter of 2011.
Todays announcement is the second dividend increase in the past 6 months. Intel previously raised the dividend 15 percent in November 2010. Intels dividend payout has steadily increased at a 33 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2003, compared to the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 growth rate of 6 percent over the same period.
Worldwide demand for computing continues to increase at a very rapid rate, putting Intel on track for revenue growth of over 20 percent this year, delivering another record year for the company, said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. Intels current and projected growth is generating strong cash flow, allowing us to further increase our dividend. We are delivering on our commitment to return cash to shareholders with annual dividend growth thats already more than five times the S&P 500.
In addition to raising the dividend over 30 percent in the past 6 months, Intel also increased the authorization limit for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion in January, bringing the total outstanding buyback authorization to $14.2 billion. In the first quarter of 2011, Intel used $4 billion of the total buyback authorization to repurchase shares. Since the companys stock buyback program began in 1990 and through the end of the first quarter of 2011, Intel repurchased approximately 3.6 billion shares at a cost of approximately $74 billion.
Intel began paying a cash dividend in 1992 and has paid out approximately $22 billion to its shareholders in dividends. Intel cash dividends for 2010 totaled approximately $3.5 billion.
Taken together since their inception, Intels dividends and stock buyback program have returned approximately $96 billion to shareholders.
