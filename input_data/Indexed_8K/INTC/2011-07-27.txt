Item 5.03                      Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On July 26, 2011, Intels Board approved amendments to Intels Bylaws, effective immediately, in connection with its Board leadership.  The amendments to the Bylaws provide that if the Chairman of the Board is a current or former employee of Intel, the Board may elect an independent Lead Director, and the amendments further provide that the Board may elect one or more Vice-Chairs, committee chairmen and such other positions as the Board may deem expedient.  The amendments specify certain duties of the Chairman, Vice Chair and Lead Director and provide for the performance of those duties in case of absence or vacancy.  In addition, the amendments to the Bylaws provide that no director shall serve as Chairman, Vice-Chair or Lead Director for more than two terms of three years each per position, and raises the minimum number of members for the Executive Committee to three.  The Board also amended Article II to clarify the notice provisions for director nominees, and approved a number of ministerial, clarifying or conforming changes to the Bylaws.
 
In connection with approving the amendments to Intels Bylaws, the Board approved conforming changes to the Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues, as well as updating such Guidelines to reflect other best practices that are followed by the Board, and adopted a Lead Director Charter.  The Guidelines and the Lead Director Charter are posted on our web site at: .

Fixing Record Dates
 
           
(a)
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the date on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon, shall have ceased to be such officer of the corporation before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.

Authority to Advance Expenses
.
 
Expenses incurred by an officer of director (acting in his capacity as such) in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, provided, however, that if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, such Expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article or otherwise.
 
Expenses incurred by other Agents of the corporation (or by the directors or officers not acting in their capacity as such, including service with respect to employee benefit plans) may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

Right of Claimant to Bring Suit

If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit, in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of Delaware, against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting such claim.
 
It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.
 
The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation.
 
Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
                      
Section 4

Provisions Nonexclusive
.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
To the extent that any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, or vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws, the provision, agreement, or vote shall take precedence.

Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
 
           
(b)
Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method hereinabove stated.
 
Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director.
 
It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one (1) permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
 
           
(c)
If no post office address of a stockholder or director be known, such notice may be sent to the office of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof.

(d)
All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing.
 
All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given:

All notices given to directors by a form of

(e)
The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or such director to receive such notice.
 
           
(f)
Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing given by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
 
           
(g)
Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person.
 
Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.
 
In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
 
(h)           Whenever notice is to be given to the corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation. If delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholders notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the companys most recent proxy statement.
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be repealed, altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted at any meeting of the stockholders, either annual or special, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock entitled to vote at such meeting.
 
The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to repeal, alter or amend these Bylaws or adopt new Bylaws (including, without limitation, the amendment of any Bylaws setting forth the number of directors who shall constitute the whole Board of Directors) by unanimous written consent or at any annual, regular, or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such Bylaws and provided that the Board of Directors shall not make or alter any Bylaws fixing the qualifications, classifications, term of office or compensation of directors.
 
 
 
When used in these Bylaws, the terms written and in writing shall include any electronic transmission, as defined in Section 232(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including without limitation any telegram, cablegram, facsimile transmission and communication by electronic mail.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 26, 2011 The board of directors elected Andy Bryant as vice chairman  of the board, a new position, in preparation for him to be elected Intels next Chairman following the companys annual stockholders meeting scheduled for May of 2012.  He will serve alongside the current chairman, Jane Shaw, until she retires from the board next May.
The board temporarily expanded from 10 to 11 members with Bryants election as vice chairman.  Bryant, the former longstanding CFO of the company and now chief administrative officer (CAO), is the second Intel officer to serve on the current board, in addition to Paul Otellini, president and chief executive officer.  When Bryant becomes executive chairman, the board will concurrently re-establish the position of lead director to be held by an independent, non-employee director.
The board welcomes the addition of Andy Bryant to its ranks and looks forward to his service as the next chairman, said Shaw, non-executive chairman.  His deep knowledge of Intel and his unmatched wisdom will serve the company well.
The election of Bryant follows a long corporate practice of senior officer and board succession planning in which the board seeks to identify a person with the particular skills and experience considered most appropriate at the time.  Bryant brings a wealth of experience at Intel that includes 13 years of service as CFO, and more recently, as the senior executive responsible for the Technology and Manufacturing Group, Information Technology, Human Resources and Finance.  Bryant will transition out of the CAO position next May as he takes on the full-time chairman responsibilities.
 I am excited about this new position for Andy and look forward to continuing to work closely with him as he assumes his new responsibilities said Otellini.
Andy Bryant is currently a member of the Board of McKesson, the leading healthcare distributor in the US, where he serves as Chair of the Finance Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. He also is a Director of Columbia Sportswear Company and Kryptiq, Inc
