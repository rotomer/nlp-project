Summary
The first quarter of 2012 came in slightly better than our expectations. Revenue of $12.9B was down 7% from $13.9B in the fourth quarter, and was slightly better than expectations. Similar to the fourth quarter our business was negatively impacted by hard drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter with demand trends playing out as expected. We believe that the hard drive supply situation improved as we progressed through the first quarter and we are not forecasting any negative impacts to our business going forward. Gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Operating income of $3.8B was 30% of revenue and down 17% from $4.6B in the fourth quarter. Net income of $2.7B and earnings per share of $0.53 were down 19% from $3.4B and 17% from $0.64 respectively from the fourth quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the first quarter 2012 results when compared to the first quarter from a year ago were the following:
           Revenue of $12.9B was flat, from $12.8B
           Gross Margin of 64.0% was up 2.6 points, from 61.4%
           Operating income of $3.8B was down 8% from $4.2B
           Net income of $2.7B was down 13% from $3.2B
           Earnings per share of $0.53 was down 5% from $0.56
As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee, Inc. and the Infineon wireless division in the first quarter of 2011, we will continue to provide Non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP to provide additional visibility into operational results of the company. The information below excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and the related income tax effect, from both first quarter 2012 and first quarter 2011 results.
Non-GAAP* Financial Comparison
           Gross Margin of 65.1% was up 3.1 points, from 62.0%
           Operating income of $4.0B was down 6% from $4.3B
           Net income of $2.9B was down 11% from $3.2B
           Earnings per share of $0.56 was down 3% from $0.58
Except as otherwise noted, the remainder of this document presents results and comparables on a GAAP basis.

First Quarter 2012
Revenue
Revenue of $12.9B was down 7% sequentially and flat from a year ago. Versus a year ago, the first quarter of 2012 included a full quarter of revenue from the acquisitions of McAfee, Inc. and the Infineon wireless division but had one less week of revenue which roughly offset the incremental revenue from the acquisitions. Platform** average selling prices were flat when compared to the fourth quarter.  Microprocessor inventory levels across the supply chain were reduced as customers managed through hard disk drive shortages.
Intel Architecture Group fourth quarter revenue of $12.0B was down 7% sequentially and down 2% year over year:
The Software and Services Group had revenue of $571M, down 1% from the fourth quarter. Year over year, the Software and Services Group revenue was up 138%. McAfee, Inc. contributed $481M to the first quarter 2012 revenue.
Gross Margin
Gross margin dollars were $8.3B, down compared to the fourth quarter.  Gross margin of 64.0% was 0.5 point lower than the fourth quarter and up 1.0 point when compared to the midpoint of the Outlook provided on January 19th.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q411 to Q112 (64.5% to 64.0%, down 0.5 point)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q112 Outlook  to Q112 (63% +/- couple points to 64.0%, up 1.0 points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q111 to Q112 (61.4% to 64.0%, up 2.6 points)
When comparing to the first quarter from a year ago, gross margin was up 2.6 points. No Cougar Point impact and lower start up costs were partially offset by higher inventory write offs.

Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A was $4.4B, up 2% from the fourth quarter and in line with the Outlook provided in January. The increase from the fourth quarter is driven by increased research and development. R&D and MG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33.9%, up from the fourth quarter.  Depreciation was $1.5B, in line with our Outlook.
Amortization of acquisition related intangibles was $81M.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net gain of $4M, higher than the $12M loss in the fourth quarter and roughly flat to our Outlook of approximately zero. 
The provision for taxes in the first quarter was at a 28% tax rate, down from our forecast of 29% on higher profits coming from lower tax jurisdictions.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was approximately $3.0B. On the balance sheet, total cash investments^^ ended the quarter at $13.8B, down $1.1B from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.0B in dividends, purchased $3.0B in capital assets, and repurchased $1.5B in stock. Total inventories were up $393M, with the increase driven by the ramp of Ivy Bridge, partially offset by the reduction in inventory of older generation products. On a unit basis, microprocessor inventory was down from the fourth quarter.
Other Items
The total number of employees was up 700 from the fourth quarter to 101K.
Diluted shares outstanding decreased by 50M shares from the fourth quarter driven by fourth quarter and first quarter share repurchases, partially offset by option exercises and an increase in our average stock price. Diluted shares outstanding decreased by 414M shares from the first quarter a year ago. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated based on a weighted average of shares outstanding during the quarter. As a result, a portion of the $4.1B of fourth quarter share repurchases and a portion of the $1.5B of the first quarter share repurchases are reflected in our first quarter weighting for diluted shares outstanding. The full impact of our first quarter repurchases will be included in our second quarter 2012 diluted shares outstanding. The total outstanding buyback authorization was $8.6B leaving the first quarter.

Q2 2012 Outlook
The Outlook for the second quarter does not include the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after April 17th. The mid-point of the forecast ranges will be referred to when making comparisons to specific periods.
Revenue
Revenue is expected to be $13.6B, plus or minus $500M in the second quarter. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 5% from the first quarter. This increase is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1% as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Gross Margin
Gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be 62%, plus or minus a couple points, down 2.0 points from the first quarter.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q112 to Q212 Outlook (64.0% to 62% +/- a couple points)
[note: point attributions are approximate]
and the qualification for sale of additional Ivy Bridge products)
 
On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, Q212 gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 63% plus or minus a couple points.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $4.6B, up from $4.4B in the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Intel Ultrabook systems marketing campaign and annual employee salary increases.
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.6B, up from the first quarter.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is forecasted to be approximately $80M.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income are expected to be a net loss of approximately $20M, compared to a net gain of $4M in the first quarter.
