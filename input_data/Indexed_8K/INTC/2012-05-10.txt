Item 7.01                      Regulation FD Disclosure
The information in this report shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
On May 10, 2012, Intel Corporation (Intel or the company) presented business and financial information to institutional investors, analysts, members of the press and the general public at a publicly webcast meeting (the Investor Meeting).  Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein is the Investor Meeting presentation made by Stacy J. Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Intel. During the course of the Investor Meeting, Mr. Smith discussed Intels financial performance, including, e.g., revenue, gross margin, spending, return on equity and return on invested capital; the financial performance and business opportunities of Intels reporting segments; and return of cash to stockholders, including cash from operations, dividends and stock repurchases. Mr. Smiths presentation includes forward-looking statements and accompanying Risk Factors.
In addition to presenting financial results calculated in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Mr. Smiths presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the charge incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of the settlement agreement with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) in the amount of $1.25 billion, and a charge incurred in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the European Commission (EC) fine in the amount of 1.06 billion, or about $1.45 billion. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the associated impacts of the AMD settlement on Intels tax provision. The EC fine did not impact the income tax provision because it was not tax deductible. Additionally, Mr. Smiths presentation defines Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as adjusted net operating profit after taxes divided by beginning invested capital. Management believes that ROIC provides greater visibility into how effectively Intel deploys capital. Management uses ROIC as a high level target to help ensure that overall performance is understood and acceptable. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner as Intel. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of company performance.
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate for both its own assessment of, and to show the reader, how our performance compares to other periods.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
