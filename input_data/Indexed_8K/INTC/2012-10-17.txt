Summary
Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5B, flat from the second quarter and slightly better than our revised expectations. Relative to the normal seasonal growth we see in the third quarter our business was negatively impacted by macroeconomic weakness leading to softness in both the consumer and enterprise market segments. In addition, we saw a reduction in inventories in the PC supply chain versus the normal increase in the third quarter. Gross margin of 63.3% was flat from the second quarter with lower unit costs being offset by factory EOL charges and slightly lower average selling prices. Operating income of $3.8B was 29% of revenue and flat sequentially. Net Income of $3.0B and earnings per share of $0.58 were up 5% and 7% respectively from the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the third quarter 2012 results when compared to the third quarter from a year ago were the following:
           Revenue of $13.5B was down 5%, from $14.2B
           Gross margin of 63.3% was flat
           Operating income of $3.8B was down 20% from $4.8B
           Net income of $3.0B was down 14% from $3.5B
           Earnings per share of $0.58 was down 11% from $0.65
As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee, Inc. and the Infineon wireless division in the first quarter of 2011, we continue to provide Non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP to provide additional visibility into operational results of the company. The information below excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and the related income tax effect, from both third quarter 2012 and third quarter 2011 results.
Non-GAAP* Financial Comparison
           Gross margin of 64.3% was flat
           Operating income of $4.1B was down 19% from $5.0B
           Net income of $3.1B was down 14% from $3.6B
           Earnings per share of $0.60 was down 12% from $0.68

Revenue
Revenue of $13.5B was flat sequentially and down 5% from a year ago. When compared to the second quarter of 2012, PC and Data Center Group volume was up 1% with PC and Data Center platform** average selling prices down 2%. We saw a reduction of microprocessor inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain when compared to the second quarter as customers remain cautious given macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release.
Intel Architecture Group third quarter revenue of $12.5B was down 1% sequentially and down 6% year over year:
The Software and Services Group had revenue of $588M, flat from the second quarter. Year over year, the Software and Services Group revenue was up 9%.

Gross margin dollars were $8.5B, flat when compared to the second quarter.  Gross margin of 63.3% was flat when compared to the second quarter and up 1.3 points when compared to the midpoint of the revised Outlook provided on September 7th.

Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q311 to Q312 (63.4% to 63.3%, approximately flat)
When comparing to the third quarter from a year ago, gross margin was flat.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A was $4.6B, flat from the second quarter and in line with the Outlook provided in July. R&D and MG&A as a percentage of revenue was 34.2%, flat from the second quarter.  Depreciation was $1.6B, in line with our Outlook.
Amortization of acquisition related intangibles was $74M.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net gain of $80M, lower than the $102M gain in the second quarter and up from our Outlook of a net gain/loss of zero. Relative to our Outlook the third quarter gains were higher primarily on the sale of equity securities.
The provision for taxes in the third quarter was at a 24% tax rate, lower than our Outlook of 28% driven by lower income in high tax jurisdictions.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was approximately $5.1B. On the balance sheet, total cash investments^^ ended the quarter at $10.5B, down $3.2B from the second quarter. During the third quarter, we paid approximately $1.1B in dividends, purchased $2.9B in capital assets, repurchased $1.2B in stock, and closed our $3.2B strategic equity investment in ASML Holding, N.V. Total inventories were up $415M as PC volume shipments finished lower than originally expected in the third quarter. More than all of the increase was driven by Ivy Bridge, partially offset by the reduction in inventory of older generation products.
Other Items
The total number of employees was up 2K from the second quarter to 105K.
Diluted shares outstanding decreased by 46M shares from the second quarter and decreased by 187M shares from the third quarter a year ago.

Q4 2012 Outlook
Intels Business Outlook does not include the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures or other investments that may be completed after October 16.The midpoint of the forecast ranges will be referred to when making comparisons to specific periods.
th
Revenue
Revenue is expected to be $13.6B, plus or minus $500M in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global economic environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets, and a slowing enterprise market segment.
Gross Margin
Gross margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be 57%, plus or minus a couple points, down 6.3 points from the third quarter. In response to the reductions in our demand forecast we are significantly reducing factory loadings in the fourth quarter, resulting in a forecast of approximately $500M in underutilization charges.
Gross Margin Reconciliation: Q312 to Q412 Outlook (63.3% to 57% +/- a couple points)
                              
 
 
On a Non-GAAP* basis, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, Q412 gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 58% plus or minus a couple points.
Spending
Spending for R&D and MG&A in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $4.5B, down slightly from $4.6B in the third quarter. The decrease is driven by lower profit dependent spending.
Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.6B, flat from the third quarter.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is forecasted to be approximately $75M.
Other Income Statement Items
Gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income are expected to be approximately $75M, compared to a net gain of $80M in the third quarter.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items
Capital spending for 2012 is now expected to be $11.3B plus or minus $300M, down from our July forecast of $12.5B, plus or minus $400M.  In response to the current demand environment, we are redirecting equipment and space to 14nm from older generation technologies, decreasing the amount of capital spending required in 2012.
As a result of fourth quarter sales and a reduction in factory loadings in the fourth quarter we expect total inventories to decline by approximately $0.5B in the fourth quarter.
