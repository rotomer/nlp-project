Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
8.             .
Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)           The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriters, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any of the Underwriters within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the reasonable and documented legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package (or any part thereof) (taken together with the underwriting commissions and net proceeds set forth in the Final Prospectus), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto if the Company shall have filed or furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters through you expressly for use therein
,
it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8
(b) 
hereof.
 
(b)           The Underwriters agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with reference to information relating to any of the Underwriters furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package (or any part thereof), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the (x) third, (y) 
second sentence of the
sixth and (z) 
seventh and eighth
paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" relating to the resale of the Securities, the making of a market in the Securities and stabilizing transactions, and a description of the underwriters' businesses, respectively.
 
(c)           If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom
 
such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person"), and the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to assume the defense of all Indemnified Persons in connection with such suit, action, proceeding, claim or demand, using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for the Underwriters, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and such control persons of the Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers and such control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding on terms reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 8 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the
 
statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions
as
the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 8.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event shall the Underwriters be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(f)            The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
9.             .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
 
purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in the Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
 
10.          .  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by written notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be,

11.          .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
