Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the Indenture also permits the amendment or supplement thereof to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with qualifications of the Indenture under the TIA, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of Holders.

On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any. On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes, the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee or a Paying Agent, funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Notes to be redeemed on the Redemption Date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by lot, on a pro-rata basis or by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; , however that in no event, shall Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less be redeemed in part.
provided
 
Notice of any redemption shall be electronically delivered or mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.  Such notice shall state the Redemption Price (if known) or the formula pursuant to which the Redemption Price is to be determined if the Redemption Price cannot be determined at the time the notice is given. If the Redemption Price cannot be determined at the time such notice is to be given, the actual Redemption Price, calculated as set forth in the Indenture, shall be set forth in an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee no later than two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as provided in the Indenture, the Notes called for redemption shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable Redemption Price.

Defaults and Remedies.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
 
The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Notes.
