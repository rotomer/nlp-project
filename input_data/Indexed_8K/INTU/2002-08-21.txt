Proposed Acquisition of Blue Ocean Software
     On August 14, 2002, Intuit Inc. announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Blue Ocean Software Inc., a leading provider of software that helps small businesses manage their information technology resources and assets.
     Intuit currently plans to operate Blue Ocean as a business unit within its Small Business and Personal Finance division and will continue to offer Blue Ocean's current products and services. Russ Hobbs, Blue Ocean's chief executive officer, will lead the operating unit as a vice president at Intuit reporting to Lorrie Norrington, executive vice president, Small Business and Personal Finance. Virtually all of Blue Ocean's 78 employees will be asked to stay with the business. Blue Ocean will continue to be based in Tampa, Florida.
     Under the terms of the agreement, Intuit will acquire all outstanding shares of Blue Ocean's stock for approximately $170 million in cash. Intuit expects Blue Ocean to contribute approximately $45 million to $55 million in revenue in fiscal year 2003. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The closing of the transaction is subject to standard closing conditions, including various regulatory approvals.
Press Release Announcing Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2002 Results
     Fiscal 2002 Results
     On August 14, 2002, Intuit announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2002. Intuit reported fiscal 2002 revenue of $1.36 billion, an increase of 18% over fiscal 2001 revenue of $1.15 billion. Intuit reported net income for the year of $140.2 million, or $0.64 per share, up from a net loss of $82.8 million, or a net loss of $0.40 per share, in fiscal 2001. Growth was driven by strong performance in Intuit's largest businesses  small business and tax. In fiscal 2002, losses related to marketable securities decreased by $82.5 million compared to fiscal 2001 and acquisition-related charges decreased by $66.6 million compared to fiscal 2001. Intuit sold its Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Quicken Loans is treated as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes. As a result, the financial results for Quicken Loans, reflecting income and expenses totaling $47.1 million, were segregated into a separate line item rather than reflected in Intuit's operating results.
     Fourth Quarter Results
     Intuit reported revenue of $197.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, an increase of 31% over the $150.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Growth was driven primarily by strong results in QuickBooks and Canada. Intuit reported a net loss for the quarter of $31.8 million, or a loss of $0.15 per share. Intuit typically reports a loss in its fourth quarter when revenue from tax preparation businesses is minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Intuit reported a net loss of $61.3 million, or a loss of $0.29 per share. The smaller loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 was due in part to the gain on the sale of Quicken Loans of $23.3 million. Intuit acquired Quicken Loans in December 1999. Because the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the value of the business was reflected on Intuit's balance sheet as the net value of the tangible assets, rather than the purchase price paid. The gain represents the premium over the net value of the tangible assets.
