Announcement of Fiscal 2003 First Quarter Results
On November 13, 2002, Intuit Inc. announced the results for its first quarter of fiscal 2003, which ended October 31, 2002. Revenue increased 32 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to $223.3 million. Intuit narrowed its seasonal net loss to $54.7 million, or $0.26 per share. This is down significantly from a net loss of $92.4 million, or $0.44 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Intuit typically reports a loss in its first quarter when revenue from its tax preparation businesses is minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels. Two factors contributed to the lower loss: lower acquisition-related charges due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's SFAS 142 and the absence of a charge for impairment of long-lived assets.
