Completed Disposition of Intuit's Japanese Subsidiary
 
On December 23, 2002, Intuit Inc. announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to Advantage Partners, Inc., a private equity investment firm located in Japan.

Announcement of Fiscal 2003 Second Quarter Results
 
On February 13, 2003, Intuit Inc. announced the results for its second quarter of fiscal 2003, which ended January 31, 2003. Revenue of $558.1 million increased 17 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Intuit reported net income of $124.8 million, up 7 percent from net income of $119.9 million in the earlier period. This represents $0.60 per share, up 9 percent from $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2002. Stronger revenue growth and lower acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2003 due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standard Board's SFAS 142 contributed to the year-over-year difference.
