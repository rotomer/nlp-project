ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On November 19, 2003, Intuit Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended October 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.01.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, and refers to them as "pro forma." Intuit computes its pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Intuit's pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies.
     Intuit's management believes that these pro forma measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Pro forma financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the historical and forward-looking pro forma financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables attached to the press release filed as an exhibit to this Report.
     The information in this Report and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.01 CONTACTS: INVESTORS MEDIA Linda Fellows, VP Holly Anderson Intuit Inc. Intuit Inc. (650) 944-5436 (650) 944-3992 or Heather McLellan Intuit Inc. (650) 944-3501 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE INTUIT'S FIRST-QUARTER 2004 REVENUE GROWS 14 PERCENT Reaffirms Fiscal 2004 Guidance MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. - NOV. 19, 2003 -- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended Oct. 31, 2003. "Intuit is off to a good start for the fiscal year with solid first-quarter results," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we're excited about the busy tax and small business season ahead, with our new TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings hitting retail shelves in the next few weeks." FIRST-QUARTER 2004 HIGHLIGHTS - Revenue of $242.5 million increased 14 percent from the year-ago quarter. Growth was driven by strong performance in Intuit's QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management Solutions growth engines. Each of Intuit's business segments reached or exceeded the revenue targets provided three months ago. - Intuit had a pro forma net loss of $47.9 million versus a pro forma net loss of $44.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The first-quarter per share results were a pro forma net loss of $0.24 versus a pro forma net loss of $0.21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Intuit typically reports a loss in its first quarter when revenue from its tax business is low but expenses remain constant. Revenue from Intuit's large TurboTax and professional tax business is highly seasonal and occurs in the company's second and third quarters. - On a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, Intuit had a net loss of $54.0 million, better than a net loss of $54.7 million in the year-ago
quarter. This represents a net loss of $0.27 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. FIRST-QUARTER BUSINESS SEGMENT REVENUE GROWTH - QUICKBOOKS revenue grew 11 percent year-over-year to $42.8 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual QuickBooks revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - INTUIT'S SMALL BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES revenue increased 22 percent over the year-ago quarter to $123.1 million. This unit includes Intuit's payroll business as well as other non-accounting products and services. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual Small Business Services revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - TURBOTAX revenue of $5.2 million was down 15 percent from first-quarter 2003, as expected. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual TurboTax revenue growth of 10 percent to 20 percent in fiscal 2004. - Revenue from Intuit's PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTING SOLUTIONS (PAS) business increased 7 percent over the year-ago quarter to $6.9 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual PAS revenue growth of 7 percent to 12 percent. - Intuit's VERTICAL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS unit had organic year-over-year revenue growth of 40 percent to $26.3 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual Verticals revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - Revenue from Other Businesses, which includes Quicken and Canada, was $38.2 million, down 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, as expected. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR SECOND-QUARTER 2004 Intuit provided its guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which will end Jan. 31, 2004. Although financial analysts have developed their own estimates for Intuit's second-quarter performance, Intuit had not previously issued guidance for the quarter. Second-quarter 2004 guidance is: - Revenue of $615 million to $640 million, or year-over-year growth of 10 percent to 15 percent.
- Pro forma operating income of $208 million to $218 million, or year-over-year growth of 13 percent to 18 percent, and GAAP operating income of $198 million to $208 million. - Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.71, or year-over-year growth of 8 percent to 16 percent, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.68. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2004 Intuit reaffirmed its pro forma guidance for fiscal 2004, which ends July 31, 2004. Intuit has recalculated its GAAP operating income and EPS guidance to reflect the additional amortization of intangibles associated with its October 2003 acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions: - Revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, or year-over-year organic growth of approximately 12 percent to 18 percent. - Pro forma operating income of $480 million to $510 million, or growth of approximately 20 percent to 28 percent over fiscal 2003. On a GAAP basis, operating income is expected to be $443 million to $473 million, or growth of approximately 29 percent to 38 percent over fiscal 2003. - Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.67, or growth of approximately 13 percent to 20 percent over fiscal 2003. Intuit expects that lower growth in Interest and Other Income will slow the growth in EPS versus the growth in operating income. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS is expected to be $1.46 to $1.56, down approximately 4 percent to 10 percent from fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 GAAP EPS included net income and gains from discontinued operations of nearly $80 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, which is not anticipated to recur in fiscal 2004. ABOUT PRO FORMA, OR NON-GAAP, FINANCIAL MEASURES Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.

CAUTIONS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements about future financial results and other events that have not yet occurred, including guidance about our expected results for fiscal 2004. Statements about Intuit's "guidance", statements including words such as "expect," "anticipate" or "believe," and statements in the future tense, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ are discussed below. More details about these and other risks are included in our SEC filings and at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors/consideration.html. We do not intend to undertake any duty to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate. - We face increasingly intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position. - If we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner, our future financial results will suffer. - Expanding our product and service offerings creates risk due to the increasing complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams. - We are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute on our growth strategy, and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our business and operations. - Any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and financial performance. - Integrating acquired businesses presents several challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not successfully integrate them with our operations. - Given the nature of the products and services that we offer, our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal. - It is too soon to provide assurances that we will be able to generate substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in our QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management solutions segments. - The product activation technology that we introduced into certain TurboTax desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this year's results for our Consumer Tax business.
- Significant delays or problems in developing our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax products would result in lost revenue and customers. - If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, we could lose revenue and customers.

INTUIT COMPUTES PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES USING THE SAME CONSISTENT METHOD FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND YEAR TO YEAR. SEE NOTES [A] THROUGH [G] FOR DETAILS.
NOTES TO TABLES A1 AND B: [A] Table B reconciles the differences between the pro forma or non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and the GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2002 and 2003. Pro forma operating income (loss) excludes certain cost and expense line items that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "acquisition-related charges," the number in the GAAP column is subtracted out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma operating income or loss. Eliminating cost or expense items improves pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Pro forma net income (loss) starts with pro forma operating income or loss and then excludes certain non-operating gains and losses that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "gains on marketable securities and other investments, net" the number in the GAAP column is taken out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma net income or loss. Eliminating loss line items improves pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Eliminating gain line items decreases pro forma results compared to GAAP results. [B] We amortize the value of software and other technology assets that we receive in connection with certain acquisitions over their estimated useful lives. [C] In connection with certain acquisitions we determine the value of in-process projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established. The value of each project is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development at the time of the acquisition. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a charge for purchased research and development of $7.8 million in connection with our acquisition of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. [D] Acquisition-related charges include amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation related to acquisitions as well as impairment charges. For the three months ended October 31, 2002 and 2003, amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation was $9.5 million and $6.0 million and there were no impairment charges. [E] Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by non-deductible merger and divestiture related charges. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes. [F] On July 31, 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business to Rock Acquisition Corporation and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we sold our residual minority equity interest in Rock and recorded a gain of $5.6 million. [G] On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net income from Intuit KK discontinued operations for the three months ended October 31, 2002 was net of income tax expense of $0.2 million.
TABLE C INTUIT INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) (Unaudited) Note: Cash and short-term investments declined during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 due to our use of cash for normal seasonal operating needs, for our stock repurchase programs and for the acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions.

THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS TABLE ARE THOSE THAT MANAGEMENT CAN PREDICT. INTUIT'S PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. EVENTS THAT COULD CAUSE THE RECONCILIATION TO CHANGE INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

[c] Reflects adjustments for amortization of purchased software of $13.8 million, charges for purchased research and development of $8.9 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $33.9 million, resulting in a 3.4% adjustment to operating margin for the twelve months ended July 31, 2003. [d] Reflects the adjustments in item [c] and adjustments for net gains on marketable securities of $10.9 million and net income from discontinued operations of $79.8 million.

[e] Reflects adjustments for amortization of purchased software of $7.0 million, charges for purchased research and development of $1.3 million and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets of $150.2 million, resulting in a 16.1% adjustment to operating margin for the twelve months ended July 31, 2000. [f] Reflects the adjustments in item [e] and adjustments for net gains on marketable securities of $481.1 million and net income from discontinued operations of $20.0 million.
