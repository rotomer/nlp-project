Exhibit 99.01
     MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 17, 2005  Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its second-quarter 2005 revenue increased 5 percent over the year-ago quarter to $662.6 million. Intuit's revenue and profits were higher than the company forecasted three months ago due to stronger-than-expected results in its QuickBooks-Related and Consumer Tax segments.
     "This was a strong quarter for Intuit, especially given that our tax revenue is increasingly shifting to our third quarter," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "While it's too early to declare victory on the entire season, we're pleased with our results in tax. We also had a strong quarter in QuickBooks, with a 38 percent surge in unit growth, including subscriptions."

About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
Intuit's management believes that the pro forma financial measures it uses provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005," "Forward-Looking Guidance for Third-Quarter Fiscal 2005, "and "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fourth-Quarter Fiscal 2005"are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following: our revenue, profitability and market position can be negatively impacted in an unpredictable manner due to product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which recently announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, and governmental encroachment in our tax businesses; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings; we have implemented new information systems but they have not yet utilized in a peak season period, any problems with these new systems, particularly during peak tax season could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to
 
maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in subsequent Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. We do not undertake any duty to update the information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.
