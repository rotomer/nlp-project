About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. Intuit's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. In addition, the forward-looking guidance for non-GAAP income, loss, earnings per share and loss per share in fiscal 2006 excludes estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These estimated stock-based compensation expenses and associated taxes are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in order to facilitate the comparison of guidance for future periods with results for past periods, which did not include such stock-based compensation expenses. Intuit's management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Non-GAAP operating income excludes amortization of purchased assets and acquisition-related charges. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share exclude gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and the tax effects of these items as well as net income or loss from discontinued operations. In addition, the forward-looking guidance for non-GAAP income, loss, earnings per share and loss per share in fiscal 2006 excludes estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The accompanying tables and sheet entitled "Intuit Facts" provide more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's non-GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2006,"and "Forward-Looking Guidance for First-Quarter 2006"are forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which has announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in our subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 24, 2005, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.

Total costs and expenses and each of the line items below it except interest and other income in Table A2 are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. Intuit's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results because they exclude amounts that are not related to Intuit's core operating results.

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Tables B1 and B2 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
The accompanying document entitled "Intuit Facts" also includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and the associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These estimated stock-based compensation expenses and the associated taxes are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in order to facilitate the comparison of guidance for future periods with results for past periods, which did not include such stock-based compensation expenses.

Tables E1 and E2 reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the accompanying document entitled "Intuit Facts" and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this Table E1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. This table includes adjustments that management can reasonably predict. Intuit's non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of purchased assets, acquisition-related charges, gains and losses on marketable securities and discontinued operations. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable securities.
