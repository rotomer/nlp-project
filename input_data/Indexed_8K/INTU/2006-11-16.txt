Exhibit 99.01
- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its first-quarter 2007 revenue increased 19 percent over the year-ago quarter to $362.1 million. Growth was primarily driven by strong sales of its QuickBooks software and add-on solutions, payroll and payments. Approximately $20 million of first-quarter revenue was attributed to the September launch of QuickBooks 2007, which was about 30 days earlier than last year. Without this earlier launch, revenue growth would have been approximately 12 percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Nov. 16, 2006
     "Intuit just completed another successful quarter," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "QuickBooks 2007 is off to a great start, and our Payroll and Payments segment also performed very well. With a new lineup of TurboTax products just launched, we're excited about the balance of the fiscal year."

First-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net loss of $58.9 million versus a net loss of $45.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. This represents a net loss of $0.17 per share versus a net loss of $0.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter 2006 results included $11.8 million, or $0.03 per share, of net income from discontinued operations. Intuit typically posts a seasonal loss in its first quarter when it has little revenue from its tax businesses.
     Intuit posted a non-GAAP net loss of $42.5 million versus a non-GAAP net loss of $45.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. The first-quarter non-GAAP net loss was $0.12 per share versus a non-GAAP net loss of $0.13 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it. A copy of the press release filed by Intuit on November 16, 2006 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains: forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2007 and beyond; all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from competitors, including Microsoft, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position. Governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position. We may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation. Our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal tax returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise. Any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation. Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period. We have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business. Our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow. Litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our Web site at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of Nov. 16, 2006, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in this press release.

The accompanying press release dated November 16, 2006 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
