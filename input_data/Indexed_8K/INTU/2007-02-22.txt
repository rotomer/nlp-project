Exhibit 99.01
- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its second-quarter 2007 revenue increased 3 percent year-over-year to $763 million, in line with expectations. For the first six months of the fiscal year, the company reported revenue growth of 8 percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 22, 2007
     Growth in the quarter was driven by strong sales in Consumer Tax, which were up 18 percent over the year-ago period, and Payroll and Payments segment, which was up 15 percent year-over-year. This growth was offset partly by revenue shifts in QuickBooks and Pro Tax, which moved about $45 million in revenue from the second quarter to the first and third quarters, compared to last year.
     "We are pleased with the early results of TurboTax and the continued strength in our Payroll and Payments segment," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We are also excited by the recent acquisition of Digital Insight, which will provide a third platform for growth as we go forward."
Second-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) diluted net income of $145 million in the quarter versus diluted net income of $183 million in the second quarter of 2006. This represents diluted net income of $0.40 per share versus diluted net income of $0.50 per share in the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2006 results

included $28 million, or 7 cents per share, from discontinued operations. Intuit posted non-GAAP diluted net income of $161 million, or $0.45 per share versus $174 million, or $0.48 per share in the second quarter of 2006.
Second-Quarter 2007 Business Segment Results
Forward-looking Guidance
     Forward-looking guidance has been adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Digital Insight, the disposition of certain fully outsourced payroll assets, and a lower effective tax rate. For fiscal 2007 Intuit now expects:
     Intuit also adjusted its previously given third quarter, fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2007 guidance for revenue and earnings per share, details of which are available on Intuit's Web site at www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors/earnings/2007.

This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it. A copy of the press release filed by Intuit on February 22, 2007 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2007 and beyond; expectations of future growth, including growth of the Digital Insight business; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively effect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any
 
Intuit Earnings Q207 Page 4
failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 22, 2007, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated February 22, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure. All share and per share figures in this Table B retroactively reflect our July 2006 two-for-one common stock split.
