Approval of Fiscal Year 2007 Bonus Awards and Fiscal 2008 Base Salaries for Senior Executives
Several of the senior executive officers of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") are eligible to receive an annual performance incentive payment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2007 ("Fiscal 2007") under Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"), because the performance goals established by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") for Fiscal 2007 were achieved. The senior executives eligible for a bonus under the SEIP are: Stephen M. Bennett, Robert B. Henske, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel, and Brad D. Smith. At meetings held on July 24 and July 25, 2007, the Committee determined the amounts of annual performance bonuses under the SEIP based on the Committee's review with management of the performance of each of the eligible executive officers.
The Committee also approved the annual performance bonuses payable to our other officers and employees, including bonuses for Scott D. Cook, William V. Campbell and Richard William Ihrie, under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2007. The Fiscal 2007 bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on its review with management of the performance of each of these individuals.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the Fiscal 2007 bonus and the Fiscal 2008 annual base salary approved for each person designated as a "named executive officer" in our 2006 annual proxy statement, and Scott D. Cook and William V. Campbell, members of Intuit's Board of Directors who are also employees.

Approval of 2008 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 24, 2007, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal 2008, a discretionary cash bonus plan.
