Several of the senior executive officers of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") are eligible to receive an annual cash performance bonus for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2008 ("Fiscal 2008") under Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"), based on the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").

Lintner, Kiran M. Patel, William V. Campbell and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on its review of the performance of each eligible executive officer.
The Committee also approved the annual performance bonus payable to R. Neil Williams under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2008, and the bonus payable to Stephen M. Bennett, Intuit's former Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the terms of his transition agreement.
