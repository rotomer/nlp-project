     In September 2008, Brad D. Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit"), adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 200,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2003 and 2004. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Smith's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration of the plan in October 2009 provided certain limit prices are reached.
     Mr. Smith also adopted a stock trading plan in September 2008 to sell approximately 6,475 shares of Intuit common stock during the same period.
     Each of these plans is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and each was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
