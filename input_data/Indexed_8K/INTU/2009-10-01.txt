On October 1, 2009, Stephen M. Bennett informed the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. that he will not stand for re-election to the Board at Intuit's next annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Bennett, who served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuit from January 2000 to January 2008, indicated that he was leaving the Board to pursue other opportunities in light of the successful transition of leadership to Brad D. Smith, Intuit's current President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Bennett has served as a director of Intuit since 2000.
In recognition of the many years of commitment and service provided by Mr. Bennett, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board approved the acceleration of vesting of Mr. Bennett's non-employee director stock option. The option to purchase 67,500 shares, granted in January 2009, will become fully vested and exercisable in December 2009, on the day before Mr. Bennett's final day on the Board. A quarter of these options would have vested on January 13, 2010. Based on Intuit's closing stock price of $28.50 on September 30, 2009, the value of the accelerated options would be approximately $300,000.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
