Adoption of Policy Concerning Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
     In October 2009 the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. (the "Company") adopted a policy that, beginning with the Company's annual meeting in 2010, will provide stockholders the opportunity to vote annually on an advisory basis whether they concur with the Company's compensation philosophy, policies and determinations for its named executive officers, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of the Company's annual proxy statement. The Company's Board and management believe that it is useful and appropriate to seek the views of stockholders when considering the design and implementation of executive compensation programs. The advisory vote on executive compensation will be non-binding but will be considered by the Compensation Committee in determining annual compensation for executive officers in subsequent periods.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
