     On February 23, 2010, Stratton D. Sclavos informed the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") that he will be leaving the Board effective March 1, 2010. Mr. Sclavos indicated that he was leaving the Board due to his need to focus on his responsibilities at the investment firm of Radar Partners and the ever-increasing amount of time he spends on the many other boards on which he serves. Mr. Sclavos has been a director of Intuit since 2001.
     In February 2010, William V. Campbell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 160,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2000 and 2003. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Campbell's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in July and August 2010.
     In December 2009, Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit's Senior Vice President and president of the Intuit Financial Institutions Division, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 120,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2004 and 2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Goodarzi's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration of the plan in July 2012, provided certain limit prices are reached.
     These plans are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and were adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
