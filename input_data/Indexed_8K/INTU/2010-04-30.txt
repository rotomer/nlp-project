ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
     On April 28, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") amended Section 1.7 of Intuit's Bylaws to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality to a majority of the votes cast. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of shares voted against the director. In conjunction with the bylaw amendment, the Board also amended Intuit's Corporate Governance Principles to provide that each director submit in writing an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that the Board may accept if stockholders do not re-elect that director. In that instance, Intuit's Nominating and Governance Committee would make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results.
     The Board also amended Section 2.2 of the Bylaws by adding provisions for advance, irrevocable, contingent resignations and for the ability of a majority of the directors then in office to fill any vacancy created by the resignation of a director that is effective as of a future date.
     The preceding description of the amendments to Intuit's Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to Intuit's amended and restated Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.01 and are incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director.

Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results.
