ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
     In June 2010, Kiran M. Patel, Intuit's Executive Vice President, Small Business Group, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 850,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under an option granted in 2005 which expires in October 2012. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Patel's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration of the plan in September 2012, provided certain limit prices are reached.
     This plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under this plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
