Approval of Fiscal Year 2010 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2011 Base Salaries
On July 21, 2010, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit's Board of Directors (the "Committee") certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Kiran M. Patel, Alexander M. Lintner, Sasan K. Goodarzi and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2010.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
In addition to the bonuses described above, Mr. Patel and Mr. Goodarzi received bonuses of $100,000 and $35,000, respectively, to help defray costs associated with travel between the executive's home and his work location.
Funding of 2010 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 21, 2010, the Committee approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees (other than individuals eligible to receive bonuses
 
under the SEIP) under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2010 in the aggregate amount of $124,000,000. A majority of Intuit's full time employees are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2010.
Approval of 2011 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 21, 2010, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2011, a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2011 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2011, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2011 based on overall performance of Intuit. A copy of the IPI for fiscal year 2011 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.
