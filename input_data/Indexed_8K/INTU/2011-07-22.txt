Departure of Director
On July 18, 2011, after almost 20 years of service, Michael R. Hallman decided to retire from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit"). He will not stand for re-election at Intuit's annual meeting of stockholders in January 2012 and will continue to serve on the Board until that time.
In recognition of the many years of commitment and service provided by Mr. Hallman, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board (the "Committee") approved the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs") for 1,854 shares awarded to Mr. Hallman on January 20, 2011, that would have been unvested as of Intuit's next annual meeting. The RSUs will become fully vested on the earlier of (i) the day immediately prior to Intuit's next annual meeting or (ii) the day immediately prior to Mr. Hallman's final day on the Board. Based on Intuit's closing stock price of $47.79 on July 20, 2011, the value of the accelerated RSUs would be approximately $88,603.
Approval of Fiscal Year 2011 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2012 Base Salaries
On July 19, 2011, the Committee certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Daniel R. Maurer, Kiran M. Patel and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2011.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
 
Approval of 2012 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 19, 2011, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 (the "IPI"), a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2012 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2012, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2012 based on overall performance of Intuit. A copy of the IPI for fiscal year 2012 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.
 
In June 2011, Laura A. Fennell, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 10,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Ms. Fennell's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in July 2012.
This plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
Transactions under this plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
