CEO Perspective
Fiscal 2012 was another strong year for Intuit, with 10 percent revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 16 percent, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. Our results and our outlook reflect the steady strength of our core businesses and Intuit's resilience in the choppy macroeconomic environment.
As consumers and small businesses benefit from our broad and healthy portfolio of offerings, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth with margin expansion.
Intuit is benefitting from a secular shift to digital solutions, and we remain confident about future growth. With the right strategy, a strong portfolio, sound financial discipline and a dedicated team, we expect to deliver another strong year, Smith said.

Stock Repurchase Program
Intuit repurchased $107 million of its common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, bringing total repurchases for fiscal 2012 to $900 million. At the end of the fiscal year the current authorization had $1.7 billion remaining for stock repurchases through August 2014.
CFO Perspective
Our financial principles and capital allocation strategy remain the same. We target double-digit organic revenue growth while growing revenue faster than expenses, said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer. When it's the best use, we'll return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.
For fiscal 2013, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 13 percent. These actions demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we continue to invest for growth as well as return cash to shareholders.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results;  expectations regarding growth from digital services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends and share repurchases; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2013; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be
Intuit Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings

adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 21, 2012, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

INTUIT INC.
NOTES TO TABLE A
 
 
 
We determined that our Intuit Websites business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Websites at July 31, 2012 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date.
We also determined that our Intuit Websites business became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was $76 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 and $79 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. Net income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 includes a net loss from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $11 million and $36 million in tax benefits from the anticipated sale of this business. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 we recorded a net loss from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $18 million.
Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated August 21, 2012 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
