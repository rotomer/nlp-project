                   (d) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (A) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as one enterprise, which, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (B) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than an announcement
with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (C) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (D) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities; (E) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in the financial markets in the United States or any calamity or crisis, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Final Prospectus; (F) any action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any federal, state or foreign governmental or regulatory authority that would, as of the Closing Date, prevent the issuance or sale of the Offered Securities; or (G) any injunction or order of any federal, state or foreign court shall have been issued that would, as of the Closing Date, prevent the issuance or sale of the Offered Securities.

In giving such opinion, Ms. Smithers may limit such opinion to the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States. Such opinion may also be subject to such assumptions and qualifications as are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.
                   (f) You shall have received the opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex C hereto. In giving such opinion, Davis Polk & Wardwell may limit such opinion to the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States and may rely, as to matters of fact, upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and upon certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials. Such opinion may also be subject to such assumptions and qualifications as are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.
                   (g) The Underwriters shall have received from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
                   (h) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters on the Closing Date, a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, of an authorized executive officer of the Company who has specific knowledge of the Company's financial matters and is satisfactory to the Underwriters stating that: (i) the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein are true and correct in all material respects as of such Closing Date; the Company has complied in all material respects with its agreements
contained herein; and there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or in the earnings or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, from that set forth in the Final Prospectus; and (ii) such officer has carefully examined the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and, in such officer's opinion, (A) as of the date of the Final Prospectus, (1) the Registration Statement did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Final Prospectus did not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (B) since the date of the Final Prospectus, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or amendment of the Final Prospectus which has not been set forth in such a supplement or amendment; and (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened.

           8.
Indemnification and Contribution.
                   (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, including any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided,
however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
                   (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus: under the caption "Underwriting": fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth paragraphs; , , that the Underwriters shall not be liable for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement.
provided
however
                   (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that the failure to so notify has materially prejudiced the rights of the indemnifying party under this Agreement. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified party and it shall have notified the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party
unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person, from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
                   (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
                   (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
           9. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes any persons substituted for a Underwriter under this Section 9. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters.
          10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated as contemplated herein, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 6 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated as contemplated herein for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (C), (D),(E), (F) or (G) of Section 7(d), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Credit Suisse First Boston LLC Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. As representatives of $500,000,000 of 4.25 % Notes due 2009 and $500,000,000 of 5.50% Notes due 2014 of International Paper Company
c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013
Dear Sirs:
                   This letter is written in connection with the Final Prospectus dated December 10, 2003 by International Paper Company (the "Company") herein referred to as the "Final Supplement."
                   In connection with the Final Prospectus
          1. We are independent certified public accountants with respect to International Paper Company (the "Company") under Rule 101 of the AICPA's Code of Professional Conduct, and its interpretations and rulings.
          2. In our opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported by the Company comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
          3. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2002. We have not audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any other period. Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any
opinion on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2001, and the consolidated statements of earnings, changes in common shareholders' equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus.
          4. For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2003 minutes of meetings of the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors of the Company as set forth in the minute books at December __, 2003, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein; we have carried out other procedures to December __, 2003, as follows (our work did not extend to the period from December __, 2003 to December __, 2003, inclusive):
                   (a) With respect to the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, we have:
                   (b) With respect to the period from October 1, 2003 to November 30, 2003, we have:
                   The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
          5. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that
                   (a) At November 30, 2003, there was any decrease in consolidated common shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown on the December 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement, other than such decrease that may have occurred due to the declaration of dividends on common and preferred shares, or
                   (b) At November 30, 2003, there was any increase in consolidated long-term debt of the Company, other than the amortization of premiums and discounts (net), as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement.
          6. As mentioned in 4, Company officials have advised us that no unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to November 30, 2003 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after November 30, 2003, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at December __, 2003, there was any decrease in consolidated common shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown on the December 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, other than such decrease that may have occurred due to the declaration of dividends on common and preferred shares, or (b) at December __, 2003, there was any increase in consolidated long-term debt of the Company as compared with amounts shown on the December 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such decrease in common shareholders' equity or increase in long-term debt, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur.
          7. At your request, we have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether, for the period from October 1, 2003 to November 30, 2003, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or consolidated net earnings of the Company. Those officials stated that, for the period from October 1, 2003 to November 30, 2003, there were no decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or consolidated earnings of the Company.
          8. At your request, we have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether, for the period from December 1, 2003 to December __, 2003, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or consolidated earnings. Those officials stated that there is insufficient information available to determine whether there were any such decreases in consolidated net sales or consolidated earnings.
          9. For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached excerpts from the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, (Exhibit A) and have performed the following procedures, which were applied as indicated with respect to the letters explained below: (tickmarks below are examples of the types of procedures D&T anticipates performing)
                   (a) Compared the amount to or accumulated the amount from amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum, and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement.
                   (b) Compared the amount to, accumulated the amount from or recalculated the amount from reports or schedules prepared by the Company for the period indicated and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement.
                   (c) Recalculated the amount or percentage, including footing and cross-footing, and found the amount or percentage to be arithmetically correct, as rounded.
                   (d) Compared the amount to or accumulated the amount from amounts in the Company's unaudited monthly internal financial statements for the period indicated and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement.
          10. It should be understood that we make no representations regarding questions of legal interpretation or regarding the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in paragraph 7 above; also, such procedures would not

The opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
