The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing.

(f) You shall have received the opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, counsel to the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex C hereto. In giving such opinion, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP may limit such opinion to the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States and may rely, as to matters of fact, upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and upon certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials. Such opinion may also be subject to such assumptions and qualifications as are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters. (g) The Underwriters shall have received from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. 12
(h) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters on the Closing Date, a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, of an authorized executive officer of the Company who has specific knowledge of the Company's financial matters and is satisfactory to the Underwriters stating that: (i) the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein are true and correct in all material respects as of such Closing Date; the Company has complied in all material respects with its agreements contained herein; and there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or in the earnings or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, from that set forth in the Final Prospectus; and (ii) such officer has carefully examined the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus and, in such officer's opinion, (A) as of the date of the Final Prospectus, (1) the Registration Statement did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Final Prospectus did not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (B) since the date of the Final Prospectus, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or amendment of the Final Prospectus which has not been set forth in such a supplement or amendment; and (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened. (i) The Underwriters shall have received on and as of the Closing Date satisfactory evidence of the good standing of the Company. (j) The Offered Securities shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through DTC. The Company will furnish the Underwriters with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Underwriters reasonably request. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in 13
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, including any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below. (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus: under the caption "Underwriting": fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth paragraphs; provided, however, that the Underwriters shall not be liable for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that the failure to so notify has materially prejudiced the rights of the indemnifying party under this Agreement. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified party and it shall have notified the indemnifying party thereof, the 14
indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person, from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be 15
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. 9. Default of Underwriters. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes any persons substituted for a Underwriter under this Section 9. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 16
10. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated as contemplated herein, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 6 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated as contemplated herein for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (C), (D),(E), (F) or (G) of Section 7(d), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. 11.

SCHEDULE A S-1
Annex A DELOITTE & TOUCHE LETTER March __, 2004 Board of Directors International Paper Company 400 Atlantic Street Stamford, CT 06921 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated 1585 Broadway New York, New York 10036 UBS Securities LLC 299 Park Avenue New York, New York 10171 As Representatives of the Underwriters of $600,000,000 of 4.00% Notes due 2010 and $400,000,000 of 5.25% Notes due 2016 of International Paper Company Dear Sirs: This letter is written in connection with the Final Prospectus dated March 15, 2004 by International Paper Company (the "Company") herein referred to as the "Final Supplement." In connection with the Final Prospectus-- 1. We are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the SEC. 2. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by us and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement A-1
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 3. We have not audited any financial statements of the Company subsequent to December 31, 2003 or as of any date or for any period prior to January 1, 2002; although we have conducted an audit for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audits were to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and for the years then ended, but not on the consolidated financial statements for any interim period within those years. Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003, and the unaudited consolidated results of operations for the three, six and nine-month periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003, included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. 4. For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2003 and 2004 minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors of the Company as set forth in the minutes books at March 9, 2004 (our work did not extend to the period from March 10, 2004, to March 15, 2004, inclusive): a. With respect to the three, six and nine-month periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003, we have-- (i) Performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described SAS No. 100, Interim Financial Information on the unaudited consolidated financial statements for these periods, described in 3, included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. (ii) Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited consolidated financial statements referred to in a(i) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. b. With respect to the period from January 1, 2004 to January 31, 2004, we have-- (i) Read the internal unaudited consolidated balance sheet and internal unaudited consolidated statement of earnings of the Company and subsidiaries for January of 2004 furnished to us by the Company, officials of the Company having advised us that no such internal unaudited financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to January 31, 2004, were available. (ii) Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the internal unaudited consolidated financial statements referred to in b(i) are stated on a basis substantially consistent A-2
with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes. 5. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that-- a. (i) Any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated financial statements described in 3, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (ii) The unaudited consolidated financial statements described in 3 do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. b. (i) At January 31, 2004, there was any increase in excess of $100 million in long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, or any decreases in excess of $100 million in consolidated net current assets or shareholders' equity of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2003 audited consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, or (ii) For the period from January 1, 2004 to January 31, 2004, there were any decreases in excess of $100 million, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales, in earnings before extraordinary items or net earnings, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the Registration Statement discloses changes that have occurred or may occur. 6. As mentioned in 4b, Company officials have advised us that no internal unaudited consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to January 31, 2004, are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after January 31, 2004, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 5. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at March 9, 2004, there was any increase in long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, or any decrease in consolidated net current assets or shareholders' equity of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown on the December 31, 2003, audited consolidated balance sheet included in the Registration Statement or (b) for the period from February 1, 2004 to March 9, 2004, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in A-3
consolidated net sales, earnings before income taxes and minority interest or net earnings. Those officials stated to the best of their knowledge (1) at March 9, 2004 long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, did not increase more than $100 million as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, (2) at March 9, 2004, there was no decrease in net current assets in excess of $100 million compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2003 balance sheet; and (3) there were no decreases in excess of $100 million for the period from February 1, 2004 to March 9, 2004 as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales, earnings before income taxes and minority interest or net earnings, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases, that the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur. 7. Our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the periods referred to in the introductory paragraph of this letter comprised audit tests and procedures deemed necessary for the purpose of expressing an opinion on such financial statements taken as a whole. For none of the periods referred to therein, or any other period, did we perform audit tests for the purpose of expressing an opinion on individual balances of accounts or summaries of selected transactions such as those enumerated above, and, accordingly, we express no opinion thereon. 8. For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached excerpts from the Registration Statement, from the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003, and have performed the following procedures, which were applied as indicated with respect to the letters explained below. A. Compared the applicable amount to or accumulated the amount from amounts contained in the audited 2003 consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement. B. Compared the amount to, accumulated the amount from or recalculated the amount from reports or schedules prepared by the Company for the period indicated and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement. Amounts appearing in such schedule or report were compared with accounting records of the Company and found to be in agreement. C. Recalculated the amount or percentage and found the amount or percentage to be arithmetically correct, as rounded. A-4
D. Compared the amount to the applicable Computation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and found the amount to be in agreement. E. Compared the applicable amount to or accumulated the amount from amounts contained in the 2001 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and found the amount or percentage to be in agreement. F. Proved the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the adjustments to the actual amounts, for the periods indicated, in the consolidated capitalization table included in the Registration Statement. It should be understood that we make no representations regarding questions of legal interpretation or regarding the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in the preceding paragraph; also, such procedures would not necessarily reveal any material misstatement of the amounts or percentages listed above. Further, we have addressed ourselves solely to the foregoing data as set forth in the Registration Statement and make no representations regarding the adequacy of disclosure or regarding whether any material facts have been omitted. This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement, and it is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to within or without the underwriting group for any purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the Registration Statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement. Yours truly, A-5

The Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-103760) relating to certain securities issuable by the Company from time to time, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement." The Prospectus Supplement and the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of the effectiveness thereof are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Prospectus." The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, is hereinafter referred to as the "Form 10-K." In connection with this opinion, we have examined the form of the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and originals or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company, such certificates of public officials, and such other documents, and have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In all such examinations, we have assumed without investigation the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified copies, the authenticity of all original or certified copies and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies. We have relied as to factual matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of officers of the Company delivered to us, the representations and warranties of the parties to the Underwriting Agreement that are contained in or made pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and certificates and other statements or information of or from public officials and officers and representatives of the Company and others (including, without limitation, the Underwriters). We have assumed performance of and compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the Underwriting Agreement by the parties thereto. We have also assumed that: (a) the Underwriters have the power and authority to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; (b) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Underwriters and is valid, legally binding and enforceable against the Underwriters in accordance with its terms; (c) the Trustee has the power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture; (d) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and is valid, legally binding and enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; (e) the Notes have been duly authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture; and (f) the Base Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 2. The Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized, C-2
executed and delivered by the Company. The Indenture constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. 3. The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company, and, when executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters today in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. 4. The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects. 5. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement did not, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture do not, and the issuance and sale today by the Company of the Notes to the Underwriters will not, (i) violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company, or (ii) violate any existing United States Federal or New York State statute, rule or regulation known to us to be applicable to the Company (provided that we express no opinion as to any applicable securities laws, statutes, rules or regulations, except as stated in the following paragraphs 7 and 8). 6. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any United States Federal or New York State governmental agency or body known to us to have jurisdiction over the Company is required to be obtained by the Company on or prior to the date hereof for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture, or the issuance and sale today by the Company of the Notes to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, except as have been obtained or made or as may be required under or pursuant to applicable securities laws, statutes, rules or regulations (as to which we express no opinion except as stated in the following paragraphs 7 and 8). 7. The Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act, and the Base Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Prospectus has been filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the SEC under the 1933 Act. To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before the SEC. 8. The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes in the manner contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be, required to be registered as an "investment company" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as C-3
amended.

Without limiting the foregoing, we express no opinion as to (x) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture that purports to waive, release or vary any statutory right of any party or any duties owing to any party to the extent that such waiver, release or variation may be limited by applicable law, or (y) any provision of the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture that purports to provide that the terms thereof may not be waived or modified except in writing, or that any prohibited or unenforceable provision thereof may be severed without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof. (c) For purposes of the opinions set forth above, we have considered, and express an opinion with respect to, only those laws, statutes, rules and regulations that in our experience are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, and in particular we do not express any opinion concerning environmental, health and safety, or real property, natural resource or land use laws, or other laws, statutes, rules or regulations applicable to the particular nature of the business conducted by the Company. (d) We express no opinion on the enforceability of rights to indemnification or contribution under United States Federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations. The enforceability of provisions in the Notes and the Indenture otherwise providing for indemnification, exculpation or contribution may be limited by applicable law or public policy. We express no opinion as to any waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in any agreement. We express no opinion concerning whether a United States Federal court would accept jurisdiction in any dispute, action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to any agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. (e) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 7 above concerning the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the absence of stop orders suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and proceedings for that purpose, we have relied exclusively on the telephone advice of the staff of the SEC. (f) Our opinions are subject to the effects of, and we express no C-4
