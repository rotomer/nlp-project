[INTERNATIONAL PAPER LOGO] International Paper Plaza 400 Atlantic Street Stamford, CT 06921 News Release Media Contacts: Jennifer Boardman, International Paper, 203-541-8407 Rick Ouellette, International Paper, 912-238-6399 Investor Contacts: Darial Sneed, International Paper, 203-541-8541 Brian Turcotte, International Paper, 203-541-8632 International Paper Reaches Definitive Agreement to Sell its Canadian Pulp and Wood Business to West Fraser Timber Co., Ltd. STAMFORD, Conn. - July 21, 2004 -- International Paper (NYSE: IP) today announced it has reached a definitive agreement to sell the capital stock of its Weldwood of Canada, Ltd. subsidiary to West Fraser Timber Co., Ltd. (TSE:WFT) of Vancouver, Canada for approximately C. $1.26 billion (approximately U.S. $950 million), subject to certain adjustments at closing. The transaction is subject to completion of due diligence and financing to be completed by the end of September, as well as applicable regulatory approvals. International Paper and West Fraser expect to complete the all-cash transaction in the fall, subject to various closing conditions. "Weldwood is a solid company with outstanding, dedicated people and a proven track record of sustainable forest management. The sale of this business is about making choices regarding how we compete in our core businesses going forward," said International Paper Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Faraci. "The stand-alone assets in Canada are based on a different operating model than our businesses in the United States," said Faraci. "Our significant U.S. land base is highly integrated with our wood products operations because they use more than 75 percent of the saw logs we harvest from our own forestland, while Weldwood's wood fiber comes from harvesting rights on government-owned land. Likewise, Weldwood's two pulp mills in Canada are stand-alone facilities, while our U.S. based pulp business is supplied by mills that also produce other products. Weldwood's stand-alone pulp mills are a good fit with West Fraser's pulp business in Canada." Based on current account balances and exchange rates, International Paper estimates that the cash proceeds at closing, after adjustments, will be approximately (U.S.) $900 million. As a result of net operating loss carryforwards, there should be no current cash outlay for taxes. International Paper estimates that the transaction will result in a one-time accounting loss,
subject to certain adjustments, of approximately $425 million before taxes ($780 million after taxes or $1.60 per share) in the third quarter of 2004. The after-tax loss reflects a U.S. taxable gain on the transaction due to the low historic U.S. tax basis in Weldwood. Additionally, Weldwood's operating results will be reclassified as discontinued operations in International Paper's consolidated financial results, beginning in the third quarter of 2004. "The timing is right for the sale of Weldwood, given the very strong wood products markets. This decision, along with the recent sale of Carter Holt Harvey's tissue business and the purchase of the Box USA corrugated packaging business, reflect choices that we believe will improve the focus of our portfolio, build stronger businesses and improve our future profitability," said Faraci. Due to this recent period of strong lumber and plywood demand, Weldwood's sales in the first quarter of 2004 were approximately U.S. $225 million, contributing $0.04 per share to International Paper's earnings for the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2004, Weldwood's sales were approximately U.S. $260 million, contributing $0.08 per share to International Paper's earnings for the second quarter. Weldwood's full-year 2003 impact on IP's earnings was $0.02 per share. The company will provide further commentary on the transaction and answer investor questions in a webcast, hosted by John Faraci, at 9:30 a.m. (EDT) on Thursday, July 22.

In such case, the Deadline Date will be deemed to be the second Business Day before the date, or the end of any time period, specified in the latest of such Comfort Letters. (f) If the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants issues any accounting rules applicable to the Purchaser which, when implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Purchaser's financial reporting status as a result of the Purchaser holding the Letter of Credit, the Purchaser will give to the Vendor not less than 20 Business Days notice requiring the Vendor to take commercially reasonable steps to replace the Letter of Credit by either implementing the Escrow Agreement, or taking other measures that are satisfactory to the Purchaser, acting reasonably, and which alleviate or avoid the material adverse effect. If, at the end of such period, or a reasonable extension thereof taking into account the implementation date for the accounting rules, the Vendor has not implemented measures as contemplated herein, the Purchaser may draw on the Letter of Credit and make the remittance described in Section 2.4(c)(ii). (g) If at any time the aggregate of the amounts paid or then payable by the Purchaser on account of the Purchase Price under Section 2.3 exceeds the Purchaser's Cost, the Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold 25% of any such excess if and to the extent the Purchaser is liable to pay an amount on behalf of the Vendor under the Tax Act. If such deduction is made and the Parties do not enter into alternative arrangements in form and substance satisfactory to the Parties acting reasonably preserving the Purchaser's ability to satisfy its obligations in respect of the amount so deducted in full at the time or times as required under the Tax Act, the Purchaser will remit such amount forthwith to the Receiver General for the account of the Vendor and provide to the Vendor a copy of a receipt of the Receiver General in respect thereof. (h) For the purposes of this Section 2.4: (i) The "Purchaser's Cost" means the excess of $1,540,000,000 over the aggregate of the Pre-Closing Cash Dividends (which amount will be confirmed by the Vendor in a notice to the Purchaser delivered on the Closing Date), or such other amount as may be agreed upon by the Parties from time to time. (ii) A certificate under subsection 116(2) of the Tax Act will be conclusively deemed to be appropriate if: (A) it accurately describes the Purchased Share, the Vendor, the Purchaser and specifies a certificate limit, a certificate date and an issuing tax services office, with no material errors or other comments, or (B) it is otherwise acceptable to the Purchaser's counsel, acting reasonably. (iii) A certificate under subsection 116(4) of the Tax Act will be conclusively deemed to be appropriate if:
-8- (A) it accurately describes the Purchased Share, the Vendor, the Purchaser, the date of disposition and specifies proceeds of disposition not less than the Purchaser's Cost, a certificate date and an issuing tax services office, with no material errors or other comments, or (B) it is otherwise acceptable to the Purchaser's counsel, acting reasonably. (iv) A Comfort Letter will be deemed to be appropriate if it contains a specific confirmation from CRA that no amounts are required to be remitted to the Receiver General under section 116 of the Tax Act in respect of the Share Sale until a date, or the end of any time period, if any, specified in the Comfort Letter, with no material errors. (v) If the Tax Act is amended to alter the 25% tax rate referenced for purposes of subsection 116(5) of the Tax Act before the Closing Date or a relevant payment date under this Agreement with application to the transactions or relevant payments contemplated under this Agreement (or is proposed to be amended with such intended retroactive effect publicly announced by the Department of Finance) the references in this Section 2.4 to 25% will be read instead as references to the tax rate as so altered. Closing Payment Statement 2.5 Not later than five Business Days before the Closing Date, the Vendor will prepare and provide to the Purchaser a statement (the "Closing Payment Statement") setting out the Vendor's reasonable estimate of the Net Worth Positive Adjustment Amount or Net Worth Negative Adjustment Amount, as the case may be. Closing Date Statements 2.6 Not later than the 60 Business Days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause: (a) the Target to prepare, and have audited by the Target's auditors, consolidated financial statements for the Target for the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and ending at 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (but without giving effect to the Closing), prepared in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the Interim Financial Statements; and (b) Target's auditors to prepare a statement setting out the calculation of the Net Worth Positive Adjustment Amount or the Net Worth Negative Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, (collectively, the "Closing Date Statements"). The Vendor will be deemed to have accepted the Closing Date Statements, and the Closing Date Statements will be deemed to be finalized, if the Vendor does not give the Purchaser notice of its objections (which must be made in good faith) on or before the date which is 20 Business Days following receipt by the Vendor of the Closing
-9- Date Statements. Any such objection will be governed by Section 2.8. Immediately following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will, upon reasonable request, provide access to the Vendor and its advisors, to all relevant books and records, with the right to take copies of the relevant information, and to the appropriate personnel, for the sole purpose of verifying the Closing Date Statements. Where the Vendor has disputed any item contained in the Closing Date Statements, the Purchaser will cause, within five Business Days of the resolution of the items in dispute pursuant to Section 2.8, the Closing Date Statements to be adjusted to reflect the resolution or determination of the dispute (the "Adjusted Closing Date Statements"). Each Party will bear the fees and expenses of its personnel or advisors in preparing or reviewing the Closing Date Statements and preparing the Adjusted Closing Date Statements. No Duplication 2.7 The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is the intention of the Parties that for the purposes of this Agreement: (a) no amount will be included in the determination or calculation of more than one of (i) any of the Vendor Paid Expenses, the Triggering Event Adjustment Amount, the Duty Expense Amount, the Duty Refund Amount or the Tax Refund Amount, and (ii) the Closing Date Net Worth; and (b) no amount included in the determination or calculation of the Closing Date Net Worth, the Vendor Paid Expenses or the Duty Expense Amount, or that is otherwise a reduction of the Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, will be the subject of a claim for indemnification by the Purchaser. Dispute Resolution 2.8 (a) Where a party (the "Disputing Party") is expressly entitled to dispute or object to any amount or calculation contemplated by Part 2 of this Agreement or otherwise have a matter determined pursuant to this Section 2.8 (each a "Dispute"), the provisions of this section will apply. To be valid, the notice (the "Dispute Notice") delivered by the Disputing Party to the other Party must be delivered within the applicable time period and contain a statement of the basis of the Disputing Party's Dispute (which may be inadequacy of information or inability to verify) and each amount in dispute. A Dispute based on inadequacy of information or inability to verify must identify the additional information the Disputing Party needs with reasonable particularity. (b) If the Disputing Party makes a good faith Dispute based on inadequacy of information or inability to verify, and requests additional information pursuant to Section 2.8(a), the Disputing Party will be deemed to have withdrawn its Dispute Notice if the Disputing Party does not give the other Party notice of its further objections (which must be made in good faith) within 20 Business Days from the day on which the additional information is given to the Disputing Party in response to the Dispute.
-10- (c) Where either Party delivers a Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Vendor will work expeditiously and in good faith to resolve the Dispute within a period of 20 Business Days after the day on which the Disputing Party gives notice to the other of its Dispute. If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute within such period the Dispute will be resolved by final and binding arbitration before a senior chartered accountant who is a partner of the firm of KPMG LLP or if KPMG LLP is unable to act, of Grant Thornton LLP, or if Grant Thornton LLP is unable to act, BDO Dunwoody LLP, or if BDO Dunwoody LLP is unable to act, any other independent firm of chartered accountants agreed upon by the Parties (the "Arbitrator") conducted in Vancouver pursuant to the provisions of the International Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia). If the Parties cannot agree on procedure within five Business Days following the day of the appointment of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator will develop an expeditious procedure for resolving the Dispute in his sole discretion. The Arbitrator will be requested to resolve the Dispute and deliver his written decision as to such items within 20 Business Days following referral of the matters to the Arbitrator. (d) If the Arbitrator is retained to determine a Dispute, the costs and expenses of the Arbitrator will be borne equally by the Vendor and the Purchaser. Each Party will bear its own costs in presenting its case to the Arbitrator. (e) If resolution or determination of any Dispute in accordance with this Section 2.8 occurs following the Closing Date, and such resolution or determination results in an adjustment to the Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser at Closing, such that amounts become owing by the Purchaser to the Vendor or amounts become refundable by the Vendor to the Purchaser, such amounts will be paid within five Business Days following such resolution or determination of the Dispute. Any payment made under this Section 2.8 will include interest at the rate of 5.11% per annum from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of payment. Tax Returns 2.9 The Purchaser will cause the Target to deliver to the Vendor a draft of each Target Company's Income Tax return for the period ending on the Closing Date (or any period ending before the Closing Date if such return was not required to have been filed before the Closing Date) as soon as is reasonably practicable after completion thereof. The Vendor will have a reasonable period to approve such returns before the filing thereof, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such tax returns for each Target Company will be prepared on a basis consistent with Income Tax returns filed by such Target Company for prior periods and the Closing Date Statements or the Adjusted Closing Date Statements, as applicable. The Purchaser will ensure that no tax return of any of the Target Companies for any period ending on or before the Closing Date is amended without the Vendor's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Reimbursement of Vendor Paid Expenses 2.10 Upon request from the Purchaser from time to time after the Closing Date, the Vendor will, within 10 Business Days of receipt of the request, reimburse the Target for the
-11- amount of any Vendor Paid Expenses paid by the Target, or at the option of the Target, pay such amounts directly to the Person to whom such amounts are owed. The Purchaser will include with its request reasonable particulars of any such Vendor Paid Expense. Reimbursement of Triggering Event Adjustment Amount 2.11 Within 10 Business Days of the end of the Triggering Event Adjustment Period, the Vendor will pay to the Purchaser the Triggering Event Adjustment Amount.

-14- (vi) any Taxes payable by the Target Companies as a consequence of the termination of the Phantom Plan in respect of any taxation year of the Target Companies ending prior to the Termination Date, except to the extent that any such liability arises as a result of the Purchaser's breach of Section 9.11; (vii) any Taxes that any of the Target Companies is required to pay as a result of a determination that any of the expenses that formed part of the calculation of the Vendor Paid Expenses were not currently deductible expenses of the Target Companies for the purposes of the Tax Act; (viii) any interest or penalties claimed by CRA from the Purchaser as a consequence of its failure to remit any amount to the Receiver General as a result of the Purchaser's reliance on a Comfort Letter as contemplated under Section 2.4(e); and (ix) any amounts paid by the Target Companies in respect of Taxes for the period ending on the Closing Date to the extent not reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet; (c) in the case of the Purchaser, in favour of the Vendor, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Wages and Benefits Accrual exceeds (ii) the total amounts paid by any of the Target Companies after the Closing Date on account of retroactive wages or benefit entitlements for periods ending before the Closing Date pursuant to any collective agreement that is not in force and effect as at the Closing Date and which is entered into by the Target Company after the Closing Date which replaces or extends a collective agreement which expires or has expired before the Closing Date; and (d) all actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) in respect of the foregoing, except that the obligations of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 4.3 will expire at the end of the period described in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2, if applicable, unless, before the expiration of such period, a demand for indemnification (a "Claim") is made in accordance with this Part 4 and is diligently pursued by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, in which case the obligation of the Indemnifying Party in respect of the Claim will continue to survive until the Claim is satisfied or extinguished. For the purposes of Section 4.3(b)(ii)(A) and Section 4.3(c)(ii) notwithstanding that the amounts of retroactive wages and benefit entitlements may be specifically allocated under the applicable collective agreement to a particular period, such amounts will be allocated in the same proportion that the number of days between the retroactive effective date of the applicable collective agreement and the Closing Date bears to the entire term of the collective agreement.
-15- Limitations On Indemnity 4.4 (a) Subject to Section 4.5, no Claim by the Indemnified Party for indemnity under Section 4.3 may be made by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the amount of an individual Claim exceeds $500,000 (each a "Threshold Claim"); (ii) the aggregate amount of all Threshold Claims exceeds $5,000,000, in which case the Indemnified Party will only be liable for the aggregate amount of all Threshold Claims in excess of $5,000,000, and (iii) the aggregate amount of all Threshold Claims and all Claims not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i) and Section 4.4(a)(ii) made by the Indemnified Party does not exceed $1,350,000,000. (b) No Claim may be made by the Purchaser for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of the Vendor if (i) such misrepresentation or breach has been cured on or before the Closing Date; or (ii) the Vendor has made disclosure in Parts 1 or 2 of the Disclosure Statement or there has been deemed disclosure of the event, condition or occurrence which would otherwise constitute a misrepresentation or breach of warranty, on or before the Interim Disclosure Date; or (iii) the Vendor has made disclosure or there has been deemed disclosure on or before the Closing Date of the event, condition or occurrence which would otherwise constitute a misrepresentation or breach of warranty on or before the Closing Date, if such event, condition or occurrence which would otherwise constitute a misrepresentation or breach of warranty was not known by the Vendor as of the Interim Disclosure Date. Exceptions to Limitations 4.5 The limitations set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i) and Section 4.4(a)(ii) will not apply to: (a) Claims by the Purchaser for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Section 1, Section 2, Section 3 or Section 24 of Schedule 3.1; (b) Claims by the Purchaser under Section 4.3(b); (c) Claims by the Vendor under Section 4.3(c), Section 6.4, Section 9.8, Section 9.9 or any breach of Section 9.12; (d) Claims by the Vendor for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Section 1 or Section 3 of Schedule 3.2; or
-16- (e) Claims by the Vendor or the Purchaser for the breach by the other Party of any of its obligations to make payments hereunder other than pursuant to an indemnity. No Special Damages 4.6 No Indemnifying Party will have any obligation to indemnify and save harmless the Indemnified Party for consequential damages, special damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, lost profits, unrealized expectations or similar items. Notice of Claim 4.7 In the event that an Indemnified Party will become aware of any information, facts or circumstances that could reasonably form the basis of a Claim by the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnified Party will promptly, but in each case no later than 15 Business Days after becoming so aware, give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. If, through no fault of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party does not receive such notice in time to effectively contest the determination of any potential liability, then the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under this Part 4 will be reduced by the amount of any loss incurred by the Indemnifying Party resulting from the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice on a prompt basis. Such notice will specify whether the potential liability arises as a result of a claim by a Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the claim does not so arise (a "Direct Claim"), and will also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is available) the factual basis for the claim and the amount of the claim, if known. Direct Claims 4.8 Following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have 45 Business Days to make such investigation of the Direct Claim as it considers necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party will make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct Claim, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both Parties agree at or prior to the expiration of such period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the Claim, failing which the matter will be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Control of Third Party Claims 4.9 With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its expense, to participate in or assume control of the negotiation, settlement and defence of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the negotiation, settlement and defence of such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel will be paid by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume such control, and the Indemnifying Party will be
-17- bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. At any time after the Indemnifying Party has assumed control of a Third Party Claim under this Section 4.9, the Indemnified Party may assume exclusive control of the Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will thereupon be released by the Indemnified Party from any liability with respect thereto with no further action required by the Parties. Settlement of Third Party Claims 4.10 Provided that notice has been duly given in accordance with Section 4.7, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defence of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will have the exclusive right to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed. If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the liability of the Indemnifying Party will be limited to the proposed settlement amount if any such consent is not obtained for any reason. Cooperation 4.11 The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and will keep each other advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available). The Indemnified Party will provide to the Indemnifying Party full and complete disclosure and complete access to and right of inspection, by the Indemnifying Party's representatives, of all documents and records in the possession or control of the Indemnified Party relating to the subject matter of any Claim. Subrogation 4.12 In the event that an Indemnified Party has a right of recovery against any third party with respect to any Third Party Claim or Direct Claim in connection with which a payment is made to such Indemnified Party by an Indemnifying Party, then: (a) such Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Party against such third party with respect to such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim; and (b) such Indemnified Party will execute all documents reasonably required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as are reasonably necessary to enable such Indemnifying Party to bring suit to enforce such rights. Claims to be Net of Insurance and Net Tax Consequences 4.13 The amount of any Claim of any Indemnified Party will be determined after taking into account any insurance proceeds and any other amounts (including Taxes) recovered from other Persons in respect of the subject of such Claim and the present value of related net Tax consequences (including Tax credits and deductions), using a discount rate that is reflective
-18- of the degree of uncertainty relating to such Tax consequences and the then-prevailing level of interest rates (such discount rate to be agreed between the Purchaser and the Vendor within 10 Business Days, failing which to be determined by the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.8). The Indemnified Party will account to the Indemnifying Party for any insurance proceeds and other amounts recovered (other than Taxes and Tax benefits) relating to a Claim which are recovered or realized by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the determination of that Claim as provided herein, to the extent that such Claim has been satisfied in an amount which did not reflect any subsequently recovered or realized amount. The Indemnified Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such insurance proceeds, other amounts recovered and Tax consequences. Additional Provisions for Environment Matters 4.14 Any Claim by the Purchaser for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Section 29 of Schedule 3.1 with respect to any investigation, remediation or containment of Contaminants that are present on or before the Closing Date (each, a "Remediation"), in any environmental media on or under or migrating from any property owned, leased, licensed, used or controlled by any Target Company on or before the Closing Date will be subject to the following additional provisions and limitations: (a) The Vendor will only be required to indemnify and save harmless the Purchaser: (i) if the Remediation is required pursuant to, or in order to avoid a fine or penalty under, an applicable Environmental Law as at the Due Diligence Satisfaction Date; (ii) to the extent that such Remediation is conducted using reasonably cost effective methods that are reasonably available for such Remediation consistent with applicable Environmental Law taking into account the adverse impact of involuntary downtime for operations being conducted at the site of the Remediation; and (iii) to the extent that the losses by the Purchaser incurred in connection with a Remediation are in excess of the losses that would be incurred for a Remediation according to the Applicable Remediation Standard, the Vendor will have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser for such excess losses. (b) If the costs of Remediation that is subject to an indemnity by the Vendor hereunder are increased due to an act or omission (after the Closing) by a Person (other than the Vendor or an agent, representative or contractor of the Vendor), the Vendor will not be responsible for any such increase in costs incurred. The Vendor will not be responsible for any increased costs or increased losses to the extent they arise by reason of a material change in the operations of the Target Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date. (c) The Vendor will have the right to control the management of any Remediation at the relevant property subject to indemnification by the Vendor pursuant to this Agreement, including the control of discussions with Government Authorities relating to
-19- the scope of any such Remediation as further described in this Section 4.14. The Vendor will notify the Purchaser, within 15 Business Days of receipt of notice of the Purchaser's Claim for indemnification for such matter, that (i) it intends to undertake such control or (ii) more information is needed from the Purchaser before the Vendor can reasonably determine that the Purchaser's Claim is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The Purchaser will promptly respond to such requests for information and, within 10 Business Days of receipt of such information, the Vendor will notify the Purchaser as to whether it will control the Remediation. Prior to a determination by the Vendor that it will control any Remediation under this Section 4.14, the Purchaser will take only those actions necessary to comply with applicable Environmental Laws to address conditions that pose an immediate environmental or health risk or other immediate and material risk. (d) In controlling a Remediation pursuant to this Section 4.14, the Vendor will (i) retain a qualified independent environmental consultant; (ii) comply with all applicable Laws, including all applicable Environmental Laws; (iii) provide copies to the Purchaser of all notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans and final reports and will provide the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity (at the Purchaser's own expense) to comment on any submissions the Vendor proposes to deliver or submit to the appropriate Government Authority prior to said submission. The Purchaser may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, contractors, lawyers or other professionals to monitor the Remediation, including any field work undertaken by the Vendor, and the Vendor will provide the Purchaser with the results of all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, the Purchaser will not take any actions that will unreasonably interfere with the Vendor's control of the Remediation. The Vendor will undertake any such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, with the conduct of operations of the Purchaser. The Purchaser will allow the Vendor reasonable access to conduct any of the work contemplated herein and will fully cooperate with the Vendor in the performance of the Remediation, including providing the Vendor with reasonable access to employees and documents as necessary. (e) If the Vendor declines to control a Remediation hereunder, the Purchaser will be entitled to control thereof. In controlling a Remediation pursuant to this Section 4.14, the Purchaser will (i) retain a qualified independent environmental consultant; (ii) comply with all applicable Laws, including all applicable Environmental Laws; and
-20- (iii) provide copies to the Vendor of all notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans and final reports and will provide the Vendor a reasonable opportunity (at the Vendor's own expense) to comment on any submissions the Purchaser proposes to deliver or submit to the appropriate Government Authority prior to said submission. The Vendor may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, contractors, lawyers or other professionals to monitor the Remediation, including any field work undertaken by the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will provide the Vendor with the results of all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, the Vendor will not take any actions that will unreasonably interfere with the Purchaser's performance of the Remediation. The Vendor's decision to allow the Purchaser to control the Remediation hereunder will not limit or expand any obligation the Vendor may have to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Additional Provisions for Tax Matters 4.15 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Claim by the Purchaser for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Section 24 of Schedule 3.1 (a "Tax Claim") will be subject to the following additional provisions and limitations: (a) the Purchaser will give prompt notice to the Vendor of any proposed assessment or reassessment, notice of assessment, or notice of re-assessment received from a Tax Authority or any other matter that may give rise to a Tax Claim (each, a "Tax Issue") and will not enter into discussions or negotiations with any applicable Government Authority administering Taxes (each, a "Tax Authority") with respect to, or settle or compromise, any Tax Issue without the Vendor's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (b) the Vendor will, within 20 Business Days after the day of receipt of notice from the Purchaser under Section (a) of a Tax Issue or, if later, at least five Business Days before the time that any Taxes in respect of which a Tax Claim by the Purchaser against the Vendor would arise ("Excess Taxes") are due, pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to all Excess Taxes owing, or alleged by the Tax Authority to be owing, as a result of the Tax Issue but not exceeding the amount of the related Tax Claim. The Vendor will be entitled to forward amounts directly to the Tax Authority on behalf of the Vendor on account of the Tax Issue. The Purchaser will preserve for the Vendor any rights of appeal or contestation related to the Tax Issue available under applicable Law; (c) the Vendor will have the right, at its expense, to appeal any Tax Issue and to represent the interests of the Target Companies in any administrative or court proceeding (each, a "Proceeding") relating to the taxation years of any of the Target Companies ending on or before the Closing or with respect to any matter that may give rise to a Tax Claim and to control the conduct of such Proceeding, including discussions, negotiations, settlement, compromise or other disposition thereof except that the Vendor may not, without the written consent of the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or compromise Taxes or Tax Issues in respect of any matter that may affect liability for Taxes of any of the Target Companies for any period following the Closing;
-21- (d) upon final resolution of such Proceeding, the Purchaser will pay to the Vendor the amount, if any, by which the amount paid by the Vendor under Section 4.15(b) exceeds the amount of the Tax Claim as finally determined, plus the after tax amount of interest or other amount received by, or credited to, a Target Company in respect of such amount; (e) the Vendor's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser for Excess Taxes will not extend to Excess Taxes that arise as a direct result of the Purchaser or any of the Target Companies, at any time after the Closing Date, (i) filing any amended return of Taxes; (ii) the making of elections or designations other than at the request of the Vendor under Section 5.13; or (iii) signing any waiver or other document or instrument extending the period within which a Tax Authority may issue a notice of assessment or reassessment, in either case for any taxation year of the Target ending on or before the Closing; (f) the Purchaser will, and will cause the Target Companies to, cooperate with any reasonable requests of the Vendor for information and assistance in relation to any Tax Issue or Proceeding and permit the Vendor during normal business hours to inspect and make copies, at its expense, of relevant books and records, and provide cooperation, including attendance at the offices of the relevant Tax Authority or at any appeal or other Proceeding related to any Tax Issue (and the Purchaser will have the right to be represented, at its expense, at all Proceedings) and make any objection, appeal or other action relating to a Tax Issue that the Vendor requests, acting reasonably. The Purchaser agrees to cause the Target Companies to execute or cause to be executed any document necessary, reasonable and appropriate to enable the Vendor to so defend, object, oppose or contest; (g) the Vendor is not responsible for any payments that would otherwise be payable hereunder to the extent the liability for Taxes is attributable to the refusal, delay or neglect of the Purchaser to observe and perform its obligations hereunder. Limitation re Applicable Plans 4.16 (a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding Section 3.1 and Schedule 3.1, but subject to Section 4.16(b), the Vendor will not have any obligation or liability to the Purchaser or any of the Target Companies or any Plan Beneficiary with respect to any funding deficit, future funding or contribution obligation or other unfunded obligation under any Applicable Plan. (b) Section 4.16(a) will not relieve the Vendor of its obligations under Section 5.7. (c) In this Section 4.16,

PART 5 COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES Investigation of Business 5.1 During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, subject to Section 5.2, the Vendor will: (a) ensure that the Target Companies will provide reasonable access to, and permit the Purchaser, through its representatives, to make such investigation of, the Business and the Target Companies and their respective assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), claims, obligations, operations, results of operations or legal or regulatory status or affairs as the Purchaser reasonably deems necessary or advisable; (b) ensure that the Target Companies will produce for inspection and provide copies to the Purchaser of (i) the documents or instruments referred to in the body of, or in any of the attachments to, this Agreement, or in the Disclosure Statement, (ii) the documents, instruments, databases, books and records relating to the matters described in Section (a), (iii) other information that, in the reasonable opinion of the Purchaser or its representatives, is required in order to make an examination of such matters; and (iv) interim quarterly financial statements for any quarter ending during the Interim Period as reviewed by the Target's auditors to the extent that any such review is requested and undertaken at the Purchaser's expense;
-23- (c) ensure that the Purchaser and its representatives will have reasonable access to the management and other employees and consultants of the Target Companies for the purposes described in Section (a) and Section (b) and, subject to applicable Law, for the purposes of planning for post-Closing management and workforce integration; during normal business hours and in a manner that is not disruptive to the conduct of the business and affairs of the Target Companies. Conditions of Disclosure 5.2 Neither the Vendor nor the Target Companies will have the obligation to disclose or otherwise make available to the Purchaser any information pursuant to Section 5.1 where such disclosure would result in the loss of privilege (except where the potential harm of losing such privilege is not material to the Vendor or the Target Companies), be contrary to Law, including the Competition Act, or result in the breach of any material agreement to which any Target Company or the Vendor is a party or by which it is bound, except that the Vendor will take reasonable commercial steps to provide disclosure in such form as may be permitted under such Laws or agreements, including reviews by third parties under conditions that will permit disclosure. All disclosure under Section 5.1 will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Except for the purposes of facilitating and obtaining Canadian Competition Satisfaction and the Designated Regulatory Approvals, seeking the satisfaction described in Section 7.1(h), or undertaking searches of publicly available information, the Purchaser will not make any enquiries of any Government Authorities without the prior written consent of the Vendor, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. To the extent reasonably practicable and, subject to the foregoing, the Parties will coordinate and will regularly report on any enquiries made by either of them to Government Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Personal Information 5.3 Each Party agrees that it will comply with Applicable Privacy Laws in the course of collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser will collect, use and disclose Personal Information prior to Closing only for purposes related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will only use Personal Information necessary to determine whether to proceed with such transactions in connection with its due diligence review under Section 5.1 and, if it does not elect to terminate this Agreement as provided herein, for the completion of such transactions. If the Purchaser proceeds with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees that Personal Information obtained as a result of such transactions will not be used or disclosed following the Closing for purposes other than for which such Personal Information was collected, except with the consent of the individuals to whom such Personal Information relates or as permitted or required by applicable Law. The Purchaser will not disclose Personal Information to any Person other than to its employees, officers, consultants and advisors ("Representatives") who are evaluating and advising on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser will protect and safeguard the Personal Information against unauthorized collection, use or disclosure, as provided by Applicable Privacy Laws. The Purchaser will cause its Representatives to observe the terms of this Section 5.3 and to protect and safeguard Personal Information in their possession. If the Vendor or the Purchaser terminates
-24- this Agreement as provided herein, the Purchaser will promptly deliver to the Vendor all Personal Information collected under Section 5.1 or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including all copies, reproductions, summaries or extracts in its possession or in the possession of any of its Representatives. Disclosure Statement 5.4 (a) The Vendor will promptly make reasonable inquiries and investigations in order to identify any exceptions to the Target R&W's that are not already included in the Disclosure Statement (the "Part 2 Exceptions") and on or before the Interim Disclosure Date, will revise and deliver to the Purchaser the Disclosure Statement by including the Part 2 Exceptions therein. (b) If, after the Interim Disclosure Date and before the Closing Date (the "Final Disclosure Date"), the Vendor becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes any of the representations and warranties of the Vendor set out in Schedule 3.1 (as modified by Parts 1 and 2 of the Disclosure Statement or this Section 5.4(b)) to be untrue or incorrect, the Vendor will promptly notify the Purchaser of such facts or conditions ("Vendor Closing Exceptions"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no such disclosure made before the Interim Disclosure Date, and (ii) no such disclosure made between the Interim Disclosure Date and the Final Disclosure Date of any fact or condition which was not known by the Vendor on the Interim Disclosure Date will constitute a misrepresentation or breach by the Vendor of any of its representations and warranties under Schedule 3.1. (c) Part 2 of the Disclosure Statement and any notice given by the Vendor to the Purchaser under Section 5.4(b) will include particulars that are sufficient to permit the Purchaser to identify the subject matter thereof and each exception to a representation or warranty will identify the specific representation or warranty of which it is an exception. Notice of Certain Matters 5.5 The Purchaser will notify the Vendor if it has acquired knowledge of any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Vendor set forth in this Agreement, or any agreement, instrument or certificate executed and delivered by the Vendor pursuant to this Agreement (as modified by Parts 1 and 2, as applicable, of the Disclosure Statement or pursuant to Section 5.4(b)), promptly upon acquiring knowledge of any such matter. Any such matter of which the Purchaser becomes aware on or before the Interim Disclosure Date will be deemed disclosed by the Vendor in Part 2 of the Disclosure Statement and will not be subject to the Vendor's obligations of indemnity under Section 4.3. Any such matter of which the Purchaser becomes aware after the Interim Disclosure Date and on or before the Final Disclosure Date (the "Purchaser Closing Exceptions") will not be subject to the Vendor's
-25- obligations of indemnity under Section 4.3 except as it relates to Section 24 of Schedule 3.1 or except if such matter was within the knowledge of the Vendor on the Interim Disclosure Date. As used in this Section 5.5, "knowledge" with respect to the Purchaser will mean the knowledge of any officer of the Purchaser. The Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to give the notice described in Section (ii) of the definition of the "Interim Disclosure Date" to the Vendor not less than four Business Days and in any event, will provide such notice not less than one full Business Day before the day described in Section (ii) of the definition of the "Due Diligence Satisfaction Date". Preliminary Prospectus 5.6 The Purchaser will give the Vendor at least four Business Days' notice before filing any preliminary prospectus in connection with the Purchaser's financing contemplated by Section 7.1(f). The Purchaser will also provide the Vendor a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such prospectus during its preparation. Subject to Section 5.2, the Vendor will, and will cause the Target to, provide all such information concerning the Target Companies as the Purchaser may reasonably require in the preparation of the prospectus and authorize the use of such information in the prospectus except that neither the Vendor nor any Target Company will have any liability to the Purchaser with respect to any such information.

-27- Competition Act Filing 5.10 The Parties will (a) file, on a confidential basis, with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, not later than 30 days after the Execution Date, a short-form pre-merger notification (which may be filed in separate parts) pursuant to and in compliance with the Competition Act and a request for advice from the Commissioner of Competition that she does not intend to make application under Section 92 of the Competition Act with respect to the transactions proposed under this Agreement; and (b) promptly furnish any additional information requested of it under such Act. If the Vendor fails to file its portion of the notification within the period contemplated herein, the Purchaser's obligation to file will be extended to the date on which the Vendor completes such filing. Investment Canada Act Filing 5.11 The Purchaser will file, on a confidential basis, with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, within 20 days after the Execution Date, an application for review pursuant to Section 17 of the Investment Canada Act and promptly furnish any additional information required of it under that Act and the Vendor will, and, subject to Section 5.2, will cause the Target Companies to, promptly furnish to the Purchaser any information concerning the Target Companies that is reasonably requested by the Purchaser. Collection of Pre-Closing Date Duty Refunds 5.12 The Purchaser will cause the Target Companies to use their commercially reasonable efforts, in a manner consistent with the Purchaser's own efforts, to maximize the amount of, and collect, refunds, returns, credits or reimbursement in whole or in part to the Target Companies of Duties paid by any of them without regard for whether they relate to periods before or after the Closing Date, including seeking administrative reviews by the applicable Government Authority of the relevant entries. If any Pre-Closing Date Duty Refunds are received by any of the Target Companies after the Closing Date, the Purchaser may deduct from the Duty Refund Amount otherwise payable in respect thereof an amount that will result in the total amounts deducted under this Section 5.12 to such date being equal to the Duty Expense Amount calculated as at the date the Pre-Closing Date Duty Refunds are received by the Target Company. Nothing in this Section 5.12 will in any way limit the Purchaser's right to pursue any course of action, or to enter into any negotiation, settlement or compromise, with respect to the subject matter of the dispute giving rise to the payment of Duties, or any matter related thereto, that the Purchaser determines is in its interest to do as long as it does not intentionally discriminate between Duties paid by the Target Companies before the Closing Date and those paid after the Closing Date or between Duties paid by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and those paid by any of the Target Companies in respect of lumber produced in the same Province and otherwise where recovery of such Duties is based on substantially similar circumstances.
-28- Elections and Designations 5.13 After the Closing, the Purchaser will cause the Target, at the request and expense of the Vendor, to prepare and file an election under subsection 93(1) of the Tax Act in respect of the Finance Company Reorganization designating such amounts as the Vendor will specify and subject to the consent of the Purchaser (which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld) to prepare and file any such other elections or designations with respect to Taxes, and take all necessary corporate action, steps or proceedings necessary or desirable as requested by the Vendor, in connection with the Finance Company Reorganization. PART 6 PRE-CLOSING MATTERS Loss Before Closing 6.1 If, during the Interim Period, the Vendor becomes aware of any loss of, or destruction or damage to, any of the Business Assets, or any third party claims against any Target Company for which any insurance policy held by the Vendor provides coverage of such Target Company, the Vendor will promptly advise the Purchaser and, at the expense of the Target Company, but subject to Section 6.3 and Section 6.4, (a) if it is able to do so in a commercially reasonable manner before Closing, make and, until Closing, diligently pursue a claim under the policy in respect of the destruction, loss, damage or claim or, if applicable, defend the third party claim; and (b) hold any insurance proceeds received by the Vendor before or after Closing in respect of the destruction, loss, damage or claim for the benefit of the Target Company, and pay such proceeds promptly on receipt to the Target Company after deducting any amounts owed to it under Section 6.3 or Section 6.4. After Closing, the Vendor will, at the expense of the Target Company, provide its reasonable cooperation to the Target Company in the pursuit of any claim. Claim After Closing 6.2 If, during the Interim Period, any loss of, or destruction or damage to, any of the Business Assets occurs or a third party claim is made against any Target Company for which any insurance policy held by the Vendor provides coverage for the Target Company and for which no claim is filed before Closing as contemplated by Section 6.1, the Vendor will, at the expense of the Target Company, but subject to Section 6.3 and Section 6.4, (a) cooperate with the Target Company in filing a claim under the policy in respect of the destruction, loss, damage or claim, and in the pursuit of the claim, and, if applicable, in defending the third party claim, and

Indemnification 6.4 In respect of any claim contemplated by Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, (a) the Purchaser will ensure that the affected Target Company indemnifies and saves harmless the Vendor from and against any and all claims suffered, incurred or sustained in making or pursuing the claim, (b) the Vendor will not be required to take any step or action involving the expenditure of funds or exposure to liability unless it is indemnified to its satisfaction (both as to the identity and creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the scope and terms of the indemnity), and (c) the Vendor will not be required to take any step or action that is reasonably expected to involve significant commitments of time by its employees unless it is compensated for the loss of time of such employees and the time expenditure is convenient to it in relation to the employee's duties. Notice of Loss 6.5 If, during the Interim Period, (a) any loss of, or destruction or damage to, any of the Business Assets occurs that, after giving effect to the receipt of insurance proceeds reasonably expected to be obtained by a Target Company as a result of the event, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (including any loss, destruction or damage described in Section 6.1 that has such effect and assuming for the purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, that the insurance proceeds include an amount equal to insurance deductibles that apply to policies of insurance of the Purchaser in respect of comparable assets) and the applicable Business Assets cannot be repaired, replaced or restored by the Closing Date by assets of equal value and utility; or
-30- (b) any part of the Business Assets is seized by a Government Authority (which, for greater certainty, does not include the expropriation implemented in March, 2003 under the Forest Revitalization Act (British Columbia)) and, after giving effect to the receipt of proceeds of taking reasonably expected to be obtained by the affected Target Company as a result of the event, such seizure would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and the applicable Business Asset cannot be replaced by the Closing Date by assets of equal value and utility, then, in either case, the Vendor will forthwith give to the Purchaser notice, including reasonable particulars, thereof including particulars of any insurance proceeds or proceeds of taking expected to be obtained by such Target Company. Purchaser's Option 6.6 The Purchaser will have the option, exercisable by notice given within five Business Days after the day on which the Purchaser receives notice of any loss, destruction, damage or seizure under Section 6.5, to (a) complete the transactions contemplated hereby without reduction of the Purchase Price, in which event all proceeds of insurance or compensation for destruction, loss, damage or seizure of any of the Business Assets will be paid directly to the affected Target Company or, if received by the Vendor will be paid by the Vendor to such Target Company promptly on receipt; or (b) terminate this Agreement and not complete the transactions contemplated hereby and in such event the Vendor and the Purchaser will be released from all obligations hereunder, other than their obligations under Section 10.2 and Section 10.6.

Phantom Plan 9.11 As soon as practicable after Closing (and in any event within 12 months after Closing), the Purchaser will cause the Target to terminate in an orderly manner the Phantom Plan.
