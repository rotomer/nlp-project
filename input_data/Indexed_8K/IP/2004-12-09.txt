ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL AGREEMENT The information set forth under Item 2.03 of this report on Form 8-K/A is hereby incorporated in Item 1.01 by reference. ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT On November 17, 2004, International Paper Company (the "Company") and Red Bird Receivables, Inc. ("Red Bird"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a three-year $1,200,000,000 Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2004 (the "Credit Facility"), by and among the Company, as performance guarantor, Red Bird, as borrower, International Paper Financial Services, Inc. ("IPFS"), as initial servicer, certain special purpose entities named therein, as loan conduits, certain financial institutions named therein, as liquidity banks, certain financial institutions named therein, as co-agents, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. In connection with borrowings by Red Bird under the Credit Facility, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries will sell receivables to IPFS, and IPFS will sell certain of those receivables to Red Bird. Red Bird will pledge those receivables as security for its periodic borrowings under the Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility and repaid may be reborrowed. The initial borrowing under the Credit facility occurred on November 17, 2004 when Red Bird obtained a loan under the Credit Facility in the amount of $240,000,000, and used the proceeds to refinance a loan of the same amount then outstanding under the Company's previous credit facility. This initial borrowing is expected to mature as early as two weeks from November 17, 2004 with the principal due at maturity and interest payable a month in arrears and calculated based on equivalent-term LIBOR plus a spread of approximately 0.40%. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The Company will guaranty certain obligations of IPFS and certain of the Company's subsidiaries to Red Bird, including obligations under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility will be available for a three-year term, and loans under the Credit Facility can be made at Red Bird's request from time to time for specific periods in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. Interest on loans under the Credit Facility will be calculated based upon, at Red Bird's request, a commercial paper rate, the prime rate or the federal funds rate, or one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR or LIBOR for such other period as agreed by the parties. Principal repayments are due at maturity, and accrued interest is payable periodically based on the applicable interest rate and at maturity in arrears. The Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.20% per annum on unborrowed amounts. The Credit Facility imposes various restrictions on Red Bird, IPFS and the Company, including limitations on their ability to change Red Bird's credit and collection policies and practices relating to receivables sold to Red Bird; the ability of Red Bird to sell, assign or otherwise dispose of, or grant liens upon, any collateral securing any loan under the Credit Facility; and the ability of Red Bird to incur any indebtedness other than 2
indebtedness incurred under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, if there is an event of default, including the acquisition by any person or group of 20% or more of the Company's voting stock or a change in ownership of IPFS or the Borrower whereby they cease to be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company; the failure to pay all amounts payable under the Credit Facility; the acceleration of the payment of any indebtedness, other than indebtedness incurred under the Credit Facility, of Red Bird due to a failure to pay, any other default or otherwise; or the acceleration of the payment of any indebtedness in excess of $200,000,000 of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than Red Bird, due to a failure to pay, any other default or otherwise; then, upon the occurrence of any such event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated and the administrative agent may proceed against the collateral securing the obligations under the Credit Facility. Upon certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default with respect to the Company or IPFS or any material subsidiary of the Company all amounts payable under the Credit Facility shall automatically become immediately due and payable. This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K filed by the registrant on November 23, 2004.

In the event that the Pool Funded Conduits decline to make any Loan, the Pool Funded Conduits' Liquidity Banks shall, at the request of Borrower, make such Loan. In the event that Gotham fails to make any Loan, Gotham's Liquidity Banks shall, at the request of Borrower, make such Loan. Wachovia Bank, National Association has been requested and is willing to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Co-Agents, the Blue Ridge Group, the Gotham Group, the PREFCO Group, the Starbird Group and the CAFCO Group in accordance with the terms hereof. ARTICLE I. THE CREDIT Section 1.1 The Facility. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Borrower (or the Servicer on Borrower's behalf) may from time to time during the Revolving Period request Advances by delivering a Borrowing Request to the Co-Agents in accordance with Section 2.1. Upon receipt of a copy of each Borrowing Request from Borrower or Servicer, each of the Co-Agents shall determine whether its Conduit will fund a Loan in an amount equal to its Group's Percentage of the requested Advance specified in such Borrowing Request, and 2
(a) in the event that Blue Ridge elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the Blue Ridge Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of the Blue Ridge Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of Blue Ridge's and the Blue Ridge Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the Blue Ridge Group's Group Limit, and (ii) Blue Ridge's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "Blue Ridge Allocation Limit"); (b) in the event that Gotham fails to make any such Loan to Borrower pursuant to Gotham's Commitment, the Gotham Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of the Liquidity Banks of Gotham severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of Gotham's and the Gotham Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the Gotham Group's Group Limit, and (ii) Gotham's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "Gotham Allocation Limit"); (c) in the event that PREFCO elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the PREFCO Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of the PREFCO Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of PREFCO's and the PREFCO Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the PREFCO Group's Group Limit, and (ii) PREFCO's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "PREFCO Allocation Limit"); (d) in the event that Starbird elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the Starbird Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of the Starbird Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of Starbird's and the Starbird Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the Starbird Group's Group Limit, and (ii) Starbird's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "Starbird Allocation Limit"); and (e) in the event that CAFCO elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the CAFCO Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of the CAFCO Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of CAFCO's and the CAFCO Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the CAFCO Group's Group Limit, and (ii) CAFCO's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "CAFCO Allocation Limit"). Each Loan shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $500,000. In no event may the aggregate principal amount of the Advances hereunder exceed 3
the lesser of (x) the Aggregate Commitment, or (y) the Borrowing Base. Each Committed Lender's Commitment under this Agreement shall terminate on the Facility Termination Date. Each of the Loans, and all other Obligations of Borrower, shall be secured by the Collateral as provided in Article IX. Section 1.2 Funding Mechanics; Liquidity Fundings. (a) Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made by (i) Gotham and/or its Liquidity Banks, (ii) Blue Ridge and/or its Liquidity Banks, (iii) PREFCO and/or its Liquidity Banks, (iv) Starbird and/or its Liquidity Banks, and/or (v) CAFCO and/or its Liquidity Banks and which (except for any Advance which does not increase the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding) shall be made in such proportions by each Group such that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans outstanding from each Group shall be in proportion to such Group's Percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Advances then outstanding hereunder. Any Advance which does not increase the aggregate principal amount outstanding may be funded solely by one or more of the members of a single Group. (b) Each Lender funding any portion of an Advance shall wire transfer the principal amount of its Loan to its applicable Co-Agent in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Borrowing Date and, subject to its receipt of such Loan proceeds, such Co-Agent shall wire transfer such funds to the account specified by Borrower in its Borrowing Request not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Borrowing Date. (c) While it is the intent of each of the Conduits to fund its respective Loans through the issuance of Promissory Notes, the parties acknowledge that if any of the Conduits is unable, or reasonably determines that it is undesirable for any reason to issue Promissory Notes to fund or maintain all or any portion of its Loans at a CP Rate, or is unable to repay such Promissory Notes upon the maturity thereof, such Conduit will avail itself of a Liquidity Funding under its Liquidity Agreement. The Liquidity Fundings may be Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, or a combination thereof, selected by Borrower in accordance with Article II; provided, however, that each Liquidity Funding shall be an Alternate Base Rate Loan at least for the first two (2) Business Days after it is funded. In addition, the parties acknowledge that most Promissory Notes are issued at a discount and at varying discount rates; accordingly, it may not be possible for all CP Rate Loans to be made in amounts precisely equal to the amounts specified in a Borrowing Request. Regardless of whether a Liquidity Funding constitutes an assignment of a Loan or the sale of one or more participations therein or any other obtaining of funding for all or any portion of any Loan, each Liquidity Bank participating in a Liquidity Funding shall have the same rights as its Conduit has hereunder with the same force and effect as if such Liquidity Bank had directly made a Loan to Borrower in the amount of its Liquidity Funding. (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to commit any Lender to make CP Rate Loans. 4
Section 1.3 Interest Rates. (a) Each CP Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the CP Tranche Period applicable thereto selected in accordance with Article II of this Agreement to (but not including) the last day of such CP Tranche Period at the applicable CP Rate. On the 5th Business Day immediately preceding each Settlement Date, each Pool Funded Conduit shall calculate the amount of its CP Costs for the applicable Calculation Period and the Gotham Agent shall calculate Gotham's CP Rate and each shall notify Borrower of such amount which shall be payable on such Settlement Date. (b) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto selected in accordance with Article II of this Agreement to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the applicable LIBOR for such Interest Period. (c) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Loan is made to but excluding the date it is paid at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 1.3(a), (b) or (c), upon the occurrence of an Amortization Event, and during the continuance thereof, all Obligations shall bear interest, payable upon demand, at the Default Rate. (e) Interest shall be payable for the day a Loan is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received by each Co-Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on a Loan shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. Section 1.4 Payment Dates; Absence of Notes to Evidence Loans. (a) Borrower promises to pay the principal of each CP Rate Loan on the last day of its CP Tranche Period. (b) Borrower promises to pay the principal of each LIBOR Loan on the last day of its Interest Period. (c) Borrower promises to pay the principal of each Alternate Base Rate Loan on or before the earlier to occur of (i) the Facility Termination Date, and (ii) the refinancing of such Loan with a CP Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan. (d) Borrower promises to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on each Loan on its applicable Settlement Date. 5
(e) Each Lender shall maintain (or cause its respective Co-Agent to maintain) in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. Upon request of Borrower, such Lender's Co-Agent or the Administrative Agent, such Lender will confirm the outstanding principal balances of its Loans and the amount of any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to this Section shall absent manifest error be correct evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender (or Co-Agent) to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. Section 1.5 Prepayments. Subject, in the case of CP Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans, to the funding indemnification provisions of Section 4.3: (a) Borrower may from time to time voluntarily prepay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 per Group (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 per Group), any portion of the outstanding Advances by giving prior written notice to the Co-Agents (each, a "Prepayment Notice"): (i) given within the Required Notice Period with respect to each Pool Funded Conduit's Loans so prepaid and (ii) providing for such prepayment to occur on the last day of the CP Tranche Period with respect to Gotham's CP Rate Loans so prepaid; provided that each such prepayment of principal complying with the provisions of this section or otherwise is accompanied by a payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, together with all amounts (if any) due under Section 4.3 and any Broken Funding Costs (if any) due because of such prepayment, and is made between the Conduits in such proportions so that after giving effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans outstanding from each Conduit shall be in proportion to such Conduit's Percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Advances then outstanding hereunder. The Co-Agent's agree to use their best efforts to accommodate any request by Borrower to prepay any portion of the outstanding Advances in any manner other than as required herein to minimize any Broken Funding Costs associated with such prepayment. (b) If, on any Business Day, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans from the Blue Ridge Group exceeds the Blue Ridge Allocation Limit, or the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding from Blue Ridge exceeds the Blue Ridge Liquidity Banks' Liquidity Commitments pursuant to the Blue Ridge Liquidity Agreement divided by 102%, Borrower shall prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the Blue Ridge Agent received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day thereafter of an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. (c) If, on any Business Day, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans from the Gotham Group exceeds the Gotham Allocation Limit, or the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding from Gotham exceeds the Gotham Liquidity Banks' aggregate Liquidity Commitments pursuant to the Gotham Liquidity Agreement divided by 102%, Borrower shall prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the Gotham Agent received not later than 6

(f) If, on any Business Day, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans from the CAFCO Group exceeds the CAFCO Allocation Limit, or the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding from CAFCO exceeds the CAFCO Liquidity Banks' aggregate Liquidity Commitments pursuant to the CAFCO Liquidity Agreement divided by 102%, Borrower shall prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the CAFCO Agent received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day thereafter of an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. (g) Upon receipt of any wire transfer pursuant to Section 1.5(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), the applicable Co-Agent shall wire transfer to each of its Constituent Lenders their respective shares thereof not later than 1:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when received. Any prepayment required pursuant to Section 1.5(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) shall be applied first, to the ratable reduction of the applicable Group's Alternate Base Rate Loans outstanding, second, to the ratable reduction of the applicable Group's LIBOR Loans outstanding, and lastly, to the reduction of the applicable Group's CP Rate Loans selected by Borrower (or the Servicer, on Borrower's behalf). Section 1.6 Reductions in Aggregate Commitment. Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or ratably among the Groups in part, in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 per Group (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 per Group), upon at least fifteen (15) Business Days' written notice to the Co-Agents (each, a "Commitment Reduction Notice"), which notice shall specify the aggregate amount of any such reduction and each Group's respective Percentage thereof, provided, however, that (a) the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Advances, and (b) the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below $250,000,000 unless the Aggregate Commitment is terminated in full. All accrued and unpaid fees, including Broken Funding Costs, if any, shall be payable on the effective date of 7

On each Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in immediately available funds to its Co-Agent by wire transfer of such amount received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time). Subject to its receipt of such wire transfers, each Co-Agent will wire transfer the funds so received from its Constituent Lenders to Borrower at the account specified in its Borrowing Request not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Borrowing Date. Unless each of the Co-Agents in its sole discretion shall otherwise agree, not more than one (1) Borrowing Date shall occur in any calendar week. Section 2.2 Selection of CP Tranche Periods and Interest Periods. (a) Except upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event and subject to Section 2.2(b) and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, Section 2.2(c): (i) Borrower (or the Servicer, on Borrower's behalf) in its Borrowing Request may request CP Tranche Periods from time to time to apply to Gotham's CP Rate Loans; provided, however, that no CP Tranche Period of Gotham may extend beyond the Gotham Group's Liquidity Termination Date, and (ii) Borrower (or the Servicer, on Borrower's behalf) in its Borrowing Request may request Interest Periods from time to time to apply to the LIBOR Loans; provided, however, that (x) at any time while any Liquidity Bank has LIBOR Loans outstanding, at least one Interest Period of such Liquidity Bank shall mature on each Settlement Date and (y) no Interest Period of any Liquidity Bank which began prior to its Liquidity Termination Date shall extend beyond such Liquidity Termination Date. (b) While the Gotham Agent will use reasonable efforts to accommodate Borrower's or the Servicer's requests for CP Tranche Periods except during the continuance of an Amortization Event, the Gotham Agent shall have the right to subdivide any requested CP Rate Loan into one or more CP Rate Loans of different CP Tranche Periods, or, if the requested period is not feasible, to suggest an alternative CP Tranche Period. While each of the Co-Agents 8
will use reasonable efforts to accommodate Borrower's or the Servicer's requests for Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans except during the continuance of an Amortization Event, each of the Co-Agents shall have the right to subdivide any requested LIBOR Loan into one or more LIBOR Loans with different Interest Periods, or, if the requested period is not feasible, to suggest an alternative Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not less than $1,000,000 of principal may be allocated to any CP Tranche Period of the Conduits or Interest Period of any Liquidity Funding, and no Alternate Base Rate Loan may have a principal amount of less than $1,000,000. (c) Borrower (or the Servicer, on Borrower's behalf) may not request an Interest Period for a LIBOR Loan unless it shall have given each of the applicable Co-Agent(s) written notice of its desire therefor not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the first day of the desired Interest Period. Accordingly, all Liquidity Fundings shall initially be Alternate Base Rate Loans. (d) Unless each of the Co-Agents shall have received written notice by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day prior to the last day of a CP Tranche Period that Borrower intends to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the CP Rate Loans outstanding, each of the Co-Agents and the Conduits shall be entitled to assume that Borrower desires to refinance the principal and interest of each maturing CP Rate Loan on the last day of its CP Tranche Period with new CP Rate Loans having substantially similar CP Tranche Periods; provided, however, that Borrower shall remain liable to pay in cash any portion of the principal or interest on the maturing CP Rate Loan when due to the extent that the applicable Conduit cannot issue Promissory Notes or avail itself of a Liquidity Funding, in either case, in the precise amount necessary to refinance the maturing CP Rate Loan and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon. (e) Unless each of the Co-Agents shall have received written notice by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the last day of an Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Loan that Borrower intends to reduce the aggregate principal amount of LIBOR Loans outstanding from the Liquidity Banks, each of the Blue Ridge Liquidity Banks, the PREFCO Liquidity Banks and the CAFCO Liquidity Banks shall be entitled to assume that Borrower desires to refinance its maturing LIBOR Loans on the last day of such Interest Period with Alternate Base Rate Loans, and each of the Gotham Liquidity Banks and the Starbird Liquidity Banks shall be entitled to assume that Borrower desires to refinance its maturing LIBOR Loans on the last day of such Interest Period with LIBOR Loans for the same Interest Period then ending to the extent of the applicable Liquidity Banks' ability to provide the funding without the customary three (3) Business Days notice or, otherwise, with Alternate Base Rate Loans. Section 2.3 Computation of Concentration Limits and Outstanding Balance. The Obligor Concentration Limits and the aggregate Outstanding Balance of Receivables of each Obligor and its Affiliated Obligors (if any) shall be calculated as if each such Obligor and its Affiliated Obligors were one Obligor. Section 2.4 Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Agreement shall require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). If at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with 9
all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the Maximum Rate which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. Section 2.5 Payments and Computations, Etc. (a) Payments. All amounts to be paid or deposited by Borrower or the Servicer (on Borrower's behalf) to any of the Agents or Lenders (other than amounts payable under Section 4.2) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due in lawful money of the United States of America to the applicable Co-Agent at its address specified in Schedule 14.2, and, to the extent such payment is for the account of any Lender, the applicable Co-Agent shall promptly disburse such funds to the appropriate Lender(s) in its Group. (b) Late Payments. To the extent permitted by law, upon demand, Borrower or the Servicer (on Borrower's behalf), as applicable, shall pay to the applicable Co-Agent for the account of each Person in its Group to whom payment of any Obligation is due, interest on all amounts not paid or deposited by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due (without taking into account any applicable grace period) at the Default Rate. (c) Method of Computation. All computations of interest at the Alternate Base Rate or the Default Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 (or, when appropriate, 366) days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed. All other computations of interest, and all computations of Servicer's Fee, any per annum fees payable under Section 4.1 and any other per annum fees payable by Borrower to the Lenders, the Servicer or any of the Agents under the Loan Documents shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed. (d) Avoidance or Rescission of Payments. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no payment of any Obligation shall be considered to have been paid if at any time such payment is rescinded or must be returned for any reason. Section 2.6 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Co-Agents. Unless a Lender notifies its Co-Agent prior to the date and time on which it is scheduled to fund a Loan that it does not intend to fund such Loan, such Co-Agent may assume that such funding will be made and may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such Loan available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender has not in fact funded its Loan proceeds to the applicable Co-Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by such Co-Agent, repay to such Co- 10
Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by such Co-Agent until the date such Co-Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day. ARTICLE III. SETTLEMENTS Section 3.1 Monthly Reporting. Not later than the Monthly Reporting Date in each calendar month hereafter, the Servicer shall deliver to each of the Co-Agents, a Monthly Report accompanied by an electronic file in a form reasonably satisfactory to each of the Co-Agents; provided, however, that if an Unmatured Amortization Event or an Amortization Event shall exist and be continuing, each of the Co-Agents may request that a computation of the Borrowing Base also be made on a date that is not a Monthly Reporting Date and, so long as such request is not made on or within 5 Business Days prior to the last day of any calendar month, the Servicer agrees to provide such computation within 5 Business Days after such request. At or before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day before each Settlement Date, each of the Co-Agents shall notify Borrower and the Servicer of (i) the aggregate principal balance of all Loans that are then outstanding from its Constituents, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all principal, interest and fees that will be due and payable by Borrower to such Co-Agent for the account of such Co-Agent or its Constituents on such Settlement Date. Section 3.2 Turnover of Collections. Without limiting any Agent's or Lender's recourse to Borrower for payment of any and all Obligations: (a) If any Monthly Report reveals that a mandatory prepayment is required under Section 1.5(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), not later than the 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the next succeeding Settlement Date, the Servicer shall turn over to each applicable Co-Agent, for distribution to its Constituents, a portion of the Collections equal to the amount of such required mandatory prepayment; (b) If, on any Settlement Date, any Loans are to be voluntarily prepaid in accordance with Section 1.5(a), or if the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding is to be reduced, the Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for distribution to its Constituents, a portion of the Collections equal to the Groups' respective Percentages of the aggregate amount of such voluntary prepayment or reduction and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with such voluntary prepayment or reduction; and (c) In addition to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each Settlement Date, (ii) on each Business Day from and after the occurrence of an Amortization Event and during the continuation thereof, and (iii) each other date on which any principal of or interest on any of the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, in the case of principal, has not been reborrowed pursuant to Section 1.1, the Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for distribution to their respective Constituents, the Groups' respective Percentages of a portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of all other Obligations that are due and owing on such date. If the Collections and proceeds of new Loans are insufficient to make all payments required under clauses (a), (b) and (c) and to pay the Servicer's 11
Fees and, if applicable, all expenses due and owing to any replacement Servicer under Section 8.1(d) (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Required Amounts") and Borrower has made any Demand Advances, Borrower shall make demand upon IPFS for payment of the Demand Advances in an amount equal to the lesser of the Required Amounts or the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such Demand Advances (plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and, upon receipt of any such amounts, Borrower shall pay them to each of the Co-Agents, ratably in accordance with their respective Groups' Percentages, for distribution in accordance with this Section 3.2. (d) If the aggregate amount of Collections and payments on Demand Advances received by the Co-Agents on any Settlement Date are insufficient to pay all Required Amounts, the aggregate amount received shall be applied to the items specified in the subclauses below, in the order of priority of such subclauses: (i) to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans that is then due and owing, including any previously accrued interest which was not paid on its applicable due date; (ii) if the Servicer is not Borrower or an Affiliate thereof, to any accrued and unpaid Servicer's Fee that is then due and owing to such Servicer, together with any invoiced expenses of the Servicer due and owing pursuant to Section 8.1(d); (iii) to the Facility Fee and the Usage Fee accrued during such Settlement Period, plus any previously accrued Facility Fee and Usage Fee not paid on a prior Settlement Date; (iv) to the payment of the principal of any Loans that are then due and owing; (v) to other Obligations that are then due and owing; and (vi) if the Servicer is Borrower, IPFS or one of their respective Affiliates, to the accrued and unpaid Servicer's Fee and Supplemental Servicer's Fee that are then due and owing to such Servicer. (e) In addition to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each Settlement Date and (ii) each other date on which any principal of or interest on any of the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), the Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for distribution to the Lenders, a portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of all Obligations that are due and owing on such date. Section 3.3 Non-Distribution of Servicer's Fee. Each of the Agents and the other Secured Parties hereby consents to the retention by the Servicer of a portion of the Collections equal to the Servicer's Fee so long as the Collections received by the Servicer are sufficient to pay all amounts pursuant to Section 3.2(d) of a higher priority as specified in such Section. Section 3.4 Deemed Collections. If as of the last day of any Settlement Period: 12
(a) the outstanding aggregate balance of the Net Pool Balance as reflected in the preceding Monthly Report (net of any positive adjustments) has been reduced for any of the following reasons: (i) as a result of any rejected services, any cash discount or any other adjustment by the Originator or any Affiliate thereof (regardless of whether the same is treated by the Originator or such Affiliate as a write-off), or as a result of any surcharge or other governmental or regulatory action, or (ii) as a result of any setoff or breach of the underlying agreement in respect of any claim by the Obligor thereof (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related or an unrelated transaction), or (iii) on account of the obligation of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof to pay to the related Obligor any rebate or refund, or (iv) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is less than the amount included in calculating the Net Pool Balance for purposes of any Monthly Report (for any reason other than such Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable), or (b) any of the representations or warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 6.1(i), (j), (l), (q)(ii), (r), (s) or (t) was not true when made with respect to any Receivable, or any of the representations or warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 6.1(i) or (j) is no longer true with respect to any Receivable, then, in such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have received a Collection in an amount equal to (A) the amount of such reduction, cancellation or overstatement, in the case of the preceding clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) and (a)(iv), and (B) in the full amount of the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable in the case of the preceding clause (b). ARTICLE IV. FEES AND YIELD PROTECTION Section 4.1 Fees. IPFS or Borrower, as applicable, shall pay to each of the Agents and the Lenders certain fees from time to time in amounts and payable on such dates as are set forth in the Fee Letters. Section 4.2 Yield Protection. (a) If any Regulatory Change occurring after the date hereof: (i) shall subject an Affected Party to any Tax (other than Excluded Taxes), duty or other charge with respect to its Obligations or, as applicable, its Commitment or its Liquidity Commitment, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to the Affected Party of any Obligations, owed to or funded in whole or in part by it or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its Obligations or, as applicable, its Commitment or its Liquidity Commitment; or 13
(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve that was not included in the computation of the applicable Interest Rate, or any special deposit or similar requirement against assets of any Affected Party, deposits or obligations with or for the account of any Affected Party or with or for the account of any affiliate (or entity deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be an affiliate) of any Affected Party, or credit extended by any Affected Party; or (iii) shall affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Affected Party; or (iv) shall impose any other condition affecting any Obligation owned or funded in whole or in part by any Affected Party, or its rights or obligations, if any, to make Loans or Liquidity Fundings; or (v) shall change the rate for, or the manner in which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or a successor thereto) assesses deposit insurance premiums or similar charges; and the result of any of the foregoing is or would be: (x) to increase the cost to or to impose a cost on (I) an Affected Party funding or making or maintaining (or providing or agreeing to provide funding for) any Loan, any Liquidity Funding, or any commitment of such Affected Party with respect to any of the foregoing, or (II) any of the Agents for continuing its or Borrower's relationship with any Affected Party, in each case, in an amount deemed to be material by such Affected Party, (y) to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by an Affected Party under this Agreement or under the Liquidity Agreement, or (z) to reduce the rate of return on such Affected Party's capital as a consequence of its Commitment, its Liquidity Commitment or the Loans made by it to a level below that which such Affected Party could have achieved but for the occurrence of such circumstances, then, within thirty days after demand by such Affected Party (which demand shall be made not more than 45 days after the date on which the Affected Party becomes aware of such Regulatory Change and shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of such demand and the methodology for calculating, and the calculation of the amounts claimed by the Affected Party), Borrower shall pay directly to such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for such actual additional cost, actual increased cost or actual reduction. (b) Each Affected Party will promptly notify Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Co-Agent of any event of which it has knowledge (including any future event that, in the judgment of such Affected Party, is reasonably certain to occur) which will entitle such Affected Party to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.2; provided, however, no failure to give or delay in giving such notification shall adversely affect the rights of any Affected Party 14
to such compensation unless such notification is given more than 45 days after the Affected Party becomes aware of such Regulatory Change. (c) In determining any amount provided for or referred to in this Section 4.2, an Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods (consistent with its ordinary business practices) that it (in its reasonable discretion) shall deem applicable. Any Affected Party when making a claim under this Section 4.2 shall submit to Borrower the above-referenced certificate as to such actual increased cost or actual reduced return (including calculation thereof in reasonable detail), which shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Borrower. (d) Each of the Lenders agrees, and to require each Affected Party to agree that, with reasonable promptness after an officer of such Lender or such Affected Party responsible for administering the Transaction Documents becomes aware that it has become an Affected Party under this Section 4.2, is entitled to receive payments under this Section 4.2, or is or has become subject to U.S. withholding Taxes payable by any Loan Party in respect of its investment hereunder, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with any internal policy of such Person or any applicable legal, rating agency or regulatory restriction or directive: (i) use all reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain its commitment or investment hereunder through another branch or office of such Affected Party, or (ii) take such other reasonable measures, if, as a result thereof, the circumstances which would cause such Person to be an Affected Party under this Section 4.2 would cease to exist, or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Person pursuant to this Section 4.2 would be reduced, or such withholding Taxes would be reduced, and if the making, funding or maintaining of such commitment or investment through such other office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such commitment or investment or the interests of such Person; provided that such Person will not be obligated to utilize such other lending office pursuant to this Section 4.2 unless Borrower agrees to pay all incremental expenses incurred by such Person as a result of utilizing such other office as described in clause (i) above. (e) If any Liquidity Bank (other than a Co-Agent) makes a claim for compensation under this Section 4.2, Borrower may propose an Eligible Assignee to the applicable Co-Agent who is willing to accept an assignment of such Liquidity Bank's Commitment, Liquidity Commitment and outstanding Loans, together with each of its other rights and obligations under the Transaction Documents; provided that any expenses or other amounts which would be owing to such Liquidity Bank pursuant to any indemnification provision hereof (including, if applicable, Section 4.3) shall be payable by Borrower as if Borrower had prepaid the Loans of the assigning Lenders rather than such assigning Lenders having assigned their respective interests hereunder. If such proposed Eligible Assignee is acceptable to the applicable Co-Agent (who shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval and shall be deemed to be acting per se reasonably when following the instructions of any rating agency then rating its respective Conduit's commercial paper or, as applicable, medium term note program), the claiming Liquidity Bank will be obligated to assign all of its rights and obligations to such proposed Eligible Assignee within ten (10) Business Days after such Co-Agent gives its consent to such proposed Eligible Assignee. 15
Section 4.3 Funding Losses. In the event that any Lender shall actually incur any actual loss or expense (including, without limitation, any actual loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired to make any Loan or Liquidity Funding) as a result of (a) Borrower's failure to borrow any LIBOR Loan on the date specified in any Borrowing Request or repayment of any LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of the applicable interest period, or (b) any event or condition specified in the definition of "Broken Funding Costs," then, upon written notice from the applicable Co-Agent to the Administrative Agent, Borrower and the Servicer, Borrower shall pay to the Servicer, and the Servicer shall pay to the applicable Co-Agent for the account of such Lender or Funding Source upon demand, the amount of such actual loss or expense (which shall include without limitation all Broken Funding Costs). Such written notice (which shall include the methodology for calculating, and the calculation of, the amount of such actual loss or expense, in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Borrower and the Servicer.

If the Servicer shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the Administrative Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Lenders on the first Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer. (d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event the Administrative Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security. (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for Borrower and the Lenders all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event and upon demand of the Administrative Agent, deliver or make available to the Administrative Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Administrative Agent. The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to Borrower any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting Receivables. The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of any Lender, furnish to the Lenders (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for the Lenders pursuant to Article II. 33
(f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to any Transferor or Borrower shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Administrative Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor. Section 8.3 Collection Notices. The Administrative Agent is authorized at any time after the occurrence and continuation of an Amortization Event to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection Notices. Borrower hereby transfers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, effective when the Administrative Agent delivers such notice, the exclusive ownership and control of each Lock Box and the Collection Accounts. In case any authorized signatory of Borrower whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent with full power of substitution, as Borrower's true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Borrower and in the name of Borrower or in its own name and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, grants to Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of Borrower, without notice or assent by Borrower to (i) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices, endorse Borrower's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) at any time after the occurrence and continuation of an Amortization Event, enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security, and (iii) at any time after the occurrence and continuation of an Amortization Event, take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Administrative Agent rather than Borrower. Section 8.4 Responsibilities of Borrower. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the exercise by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of their rights hereunder shall not release the Servicer, any Transferor or Borrower from any of their duties or obligations with respect to any Receivables or under the related Contracts. The Lenders shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables or related Contracts, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform the obligations of Borrower. Section 8.5 Monthly Reports. The Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Co-Agents (i) on each Monthly Reporting Date, a Monthly Report and an electronic file of the data contained therein and (ii) upon five (5) Business Day's notice by Administrative Agent and in no event not more than once every six months, a listing by Obligor (such Obligors to be limited to those with payables in excess of $250,000) of all Receivables together with an aging of such Receivables; provided, however, that if (a) an Amortization Event shall exist and be continuing [***] (i) each of the Co-Agents may request a Monthly Report be prepared and forwarded to the Co-Agents more frequently than monthly and, so long as such request is not made on or within 5 Business Days prior to the last day of any calendar month, the Servicer agrees to provide such report within 5 Business Days after such request and (ii) at such times as the Administrative Agent shall request, the Servicer agrees to prepare and 34
forward to the Co-Agents a listing by Obligor of all Receivables together with an aging of such Receivables. Section 8.6 Servicing Fee. As compensation for the Servicer's servicing activities on their behalf, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee, which fee shall be paid in arrears on the 2nd Business Day after each Monthly Reporting Date, and the parties hereby agree that such fee shall be paid out of Collections in accordance with Section 3.2.

Liquidity Banks against any and all liability, cost and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking any such action. Section 11.6 Non-Reliance on Other Agents and Lenders. Each of the Lenders expressly acknowledges that none of the Agents, nor any of the Agents' respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any of the Agents hereafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Agent. Each of the Lenders also represents and warrants to the Agents and the other Lenders that it has, independently and without reliance upon any such Person (or any of their Affiliates) and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Lenders also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Liquidity Bank or Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties. The Agents, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any party to this Agreement with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Loan Parties which may come into the possession of such Person or any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates, except that each of the Agents shall promptly distribute to the other Agents and the Lenders, copies of financial and other information expressly provided to it by any of the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 11.8 Agents in their Individual Capacities. Each of the Agents in its individual capacity and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Loan Parties and their Affiliates as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder.

Section 11.10 UCC Filings. Each of the Secured Parties hereby expressly recognizes and agrees that the Administrative Agent may be listed as the assignee or secured party of record on the various UCC filings required to be made under the Transaction Documents in order to perfect their respective interests in the Collateral, that such listing shall be for administrative convenience only in creating a record or nominee holder to take certain actions hereunder on behalf of the Secured Parties and that such listing will not affect in any way the status of the Secured Parties as the true parties in interest with respect to the Collateral. In addition, such listing shall impose no duties on the Administrative Agent other than those expressly and specifically undertaken in accordance with this Article XI. ARTICLE XII. ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS Section 12.1 Restrictions on Assignments. (a) Except to the extent permitted by the Transaction Documents, no Loan Party may assign its rights, or delegate its duties hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each of the Agents and, if required by any Conduit, satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition. (b) Each of the Conduits may, at any time, assign all or any portion of any of its Loans, or sell participations therein, to its Constituent Liquidity Banks (or to its Co-Agent for the ratable benefit of its Constituent Liquidity Banks). (c) In addition to, and not in limitation of, assignments and participations described in Section 12.1(b): (i) in the event that any of the Liquidity Banks becomes a Downgraded Liquidity Bank, such Downgraded Liquidity Bank shall give prompt written notice of its Downgrading Event to the applicable Co-Agent and Borrower. Within 5 Business Days after Borrower's receipt of such notice, Borrower may propose an Eligible Assignee who is willing to accept an 47
assignment of, and to assume, such Downgraded Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the applicable Liquidity Agreement. In the event that Borrower fails to propose such an Eligible Assignee within such 5 Business Day period, or such Eligible Assignee does not execute and deliver assignment and assumption documents reasonably acceptable to such Downgraded Liquidity Bank and the applicable Co-Agent and pay the Downgraded Liquidity Bank's Obligations in full, in each case, not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 10th Business Day following Borrower's receipt of notice of such Downgrading Event, the applicable Co-Agent may identify an Eligible Assignee without Borrower's consent, and the Downgraded Liquidity Bank shall promptly assign its rights and obligations to the Eligible Assignee designated by such Co-Agent against payment in full of its Obligations; (ii) each of the Lenders may assign all or any portion of its Loans and, if applicable, its Commitment and Liquidity Commitment, to any Eligible Assignee with the prior written consent of (A) Borrower and (B) such Lender's applicable Co-Agent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no such consent shall be required if such Eligible Assignee is already a Liquidity Bank party to this Agreement and the aggregate Liquidity Commitments, after giving effect to such assignment, would not be reduced solely because of such assignment; (iii) each of the Lenders may, without the prior written consent of Borrower or any of the Agents, sell participations in all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations in, to and under the Transaction Documents and the Obligations to any bank or other financial entity (each, a "Participant") in accordance with Sections 12.2 and 14.5. (d) Nothing herein shall limit the ability of any Conduit to grant a security interest therein to the program collateral agent for such Conduit's Promissory Note program. Section 12.2 Rights of Assignees and Participants. (a) Upon the assignment by a Lender in accordance with Section 1.2(c) or 12.1(b) or (c), the Eligible Assignee(s) receiving such assignment shall have all of the rights of such Lender with respect to the Transaction Documents and the Obligations (or such portion thereof as has been assigned). (b) In no event will the sale of any participation interest in any Lender's or any Eligible Assignee's rights under the Transaction Documents or in the Obligations relieve the seller of such participation interest of its obligations, if any, hereunder or, if applicable, under the Liquidity Agreement to which it is a party and such seller shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder. No Participant shall have any right to restrict the approval of or to approve any amendment, modification or waiver to the provisions hereof except to the extent any such amendment, modification or waiver reduces the amount of Advances or the interest rate or fees payable with respect to such Advances; provided, however, that to the extent that any Liquidity Funding is deemed to be the sale of a participation, the 48
foregoing limitation on Participants' voting rights shall not apply to any Liquidity Bank participating in such Liquidity Funding. Section 12.3 Terms and Evidence of Assignment. Any assignment to any Eligible Assignee(s) pursuant to Section 1.2(c), 12.1(b) or 12.1(c) shall be upon such terms and conditions as the assigning Lender and the applicable Co-Agent, on the one hand, and the Eligible Assignee, on the other, may mutually agree, and shall be evidenced by such instrument(s) or document(s) as may be satisfactory to such Lender, the applicable Co-Agent and the Eligible Assignee(s). Any assignment made in accordance with the terms of this Article XII shall relieve the assigning Lender of its obligations, if any, under this Agreement (and, if applicable, the Liquidity Agreement to which it is a party) to the extent assigned. ARTICLE XIII. SECURITY INTEREST Section 13.1 Grant of Security Interest. To secure the due and punctual payment of the Obligations, whether now or hereafter existing, due or to become due, direct or indirect, or absolute or contingent, including, without limitation, all Indemnified Amounts, in each case pro rata according to the respective amounts thereof, Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in, all of Borrower's right, title and interest, whether now owned and existing or hereafter arising in and to all of the Receivables, the Related Security, the Collections and all proceeds of the foregoing (collectively, the "Collateral"). Section 13.2 Termination after Final Payout Date. Each of the Secured Parties hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees, promptly after the Final Payout Date to execute and deliver to Borrower such UCC termination statements as may be necessary to terminate the Administrative Agent's security interest in and Lien upon the Collateral, all at Borrower's expense. Upon the Final Payout Date, all right, title and interest of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in and to the Collateral shall terminate. Section 13.3 Release of Certain Charged-Off Receivables. From time to time, the Borrower may request that the Agents and the Lenders release their security interest in specific Receivables that have been fully charged-off (and all related Collections thereof and Records) in order to permit their sale to International Paper on an arms'-length basis by delivering a written request to the Agents accompanied by a list of the specific Receivables involved, including related dollar amounts, sales prices and purchasers, not less than 5 Business Days prior to the proposed third party sale. Provided that no Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event then exists or would result from such sale, each of the Co-Agents and the Lenders hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees, to execute a specific release in substantially the form of the first document included in Exhibit X hereto, and the Borrower hereby agrees to execute a sale and assignment of such specific Receivables in substantially the form of the second document included in Exhibit X hereto. 49
ARTICLE XIV. MISCELLANEOUS Section 14.1 Waivers and Amendments. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each of the Loan Parties and the Agents, and any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that: (a) before any Co-Agent enters into such an amendment or grants such a waiver or consent that is deemed to be material by S&P and/or Moody's, if required by its Conduit's program documents, the Rating Agency Condition must be satisfied with respect to such Conduit, and (b) without the prior written consent of all Gotham Liquidity Banks with respect to the Gotham Agent, the Blue Ridge Liquidity Banks with respect to the Blue Ridge Agent, the PREFCO Liquidity Banks with respect to the PREFCO Agent, the Starbird Liquidity Banks with respect to the Starbird Agent and the CAFCO Liquidity Banks with respect to the CAFCO Agents, such Co-Agent will not amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement which would (i) reduce the amount of any principal or interest that is payable on account of its Conduit's Loans or delay any scheduled date for payment thereof; (ii) decrease the Required Reserve, decrease the spread included in any Interest Rate or change the Servicer's Fee; (iii) modify this Section 14.1; or (iv) modify any yield protection or indemnity provision which expressly inures to the benefit of assignees or Participants of such Co-Agent's Conduit. Section 14.2 Notices. Except as provided in this Section 14.2, all communications and notices provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopy or electronic facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to the other parties hereto at their respective addresses or telecopy numbers set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or telecopy number as such Person may hereafter specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto. Each such notice or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (ii) if given by mail, three (3) Business Days after the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class postage prepaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when received at the address specified in this Section 14.2. Borrower hereby authorizes each of the Co-Agents to effect Advances and Interest Period and Interest Rate selections based on telephonic notices made by any Person whom such Co-Agent in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of Borrower. Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Co-Agents a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized officer of Borrower; provided, however, the absence of such confirmation shall not affect the validity of such notice. If the written confirmation differs from the action taken by the Co-Agents, the records of the Co-Agents shall govern absent manifest error. Section 14.3 Ratable Payments. Except as provided in the next sentence, if any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any portion of the Obligations owing to such Lender (other than payments received pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender entitled to receive a ratable share of such Obligations, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for cash 50
without recourse or warranty a portion of such Obligations held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of such Obligations; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Liquidity Banks in one of the Groups decline to extend their Liquidity Termination Date, their Co-Agent will promptly notify the other Co-Agents and Borrower of such decision, and Borrower shall have the right to replace the non-extending Group with a new Conduit and one or more new Liquidity Banks without repaying any portion of the other Group's Loans at the time of such replacement, and without triggering the purchase requirements under the preceding sentence. Section 14.4 Protection of Administrative Agent's Security Interest. (a) Borrower agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral, or to enable the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder. At any time after the occurrence and continuation of an Amortization Event, the Administrative Agent may, or the Administrative Agent may direct Borrower or the Servicer to, notify the Obligors of Receivables, at Borrower's expense, of the ownership or security interests of the Lenders under this Agreement and may also direct that payments of all amounts due or that become due under any or all Receivables be made directly to the Administrative Agent or its designee. Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) shall, at any Lender's request, withhold the identity of such Lender in any such notification. (b) If any Loan Party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligations, and the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower as provided in Section 10.3. Each Loan Party irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, and appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to act on behalf of such Loan Party (i) to execute on behalf of Borrower as debtor and to file financing statements necessary or desirable in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the interest of the Lenders in the Receivables and (ii) to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement with respect to the Receivables as a financing statement in such offices as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion deems necessary or desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral, for the benefit of the Secured Parties. This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Each of the Loan Parties (A) hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to file financing statements and other filing or recording documents with respect to the Receivables and Related Security (including any amendments thereto, or continuation or termination statements thereof), without the signature or other authorization of such Loan Party, in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the perfection of the security interest of the Administrative Agent hereunder, (B) acknowledges and agrees that it is not authorized to, and will not, file financing statements or other filing or recording documents with respect to the 51
Receivables or Related Security (including any amendments thereto, or continuation or termination statements thereof), without the express prior written approval by the Administrative Agent, consenting to the form and substance of such filing or recording document, and approves, authorizes and ratifies any filings or recordings made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent in connection with the perfection of the security interests in favor of Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Section 14.5 Confidentiality. (a) Each Loan Party and each Lender shall maintain and shall cause each of its employees and officers to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the Fee Letters and the other confidential or proprietary information that are clearly marked as being confidential and/or proprietary with respect to any Agent or any Conduit and their respective businesses obtained by it or them in connection with the structuring, negotiating and execution of the transactions contemplated herein, except that such Loan Party and such Lender and its officers and employees may disclose such information to such Loan Party's and such Lender's external accountants and attorneys and as required by any applicable law or order of any judicial or administrative proceeding. (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Loan Party hereby consents to the disclosure of any nonpublic information with respect to it (i) to any Agent, the Liquidity Banks or any Conduit by each other, (ii) by any Agent or the Lenders to any prospective or actual assignee or Participant of any of them and (iii) by any Agent to any rating agency, Promissory Note dealer or provider of a surety, guaranty or credit or liquidity enhancement to any Conduit or any entity organized for the purpose of purchasing, or making loans secured by, financial assets for which Wachovia, BTM, JPMorgan, BNP Paribas or Citibank or any of their respective Affiliates acts as the administrative agent and to any officers, directors, employees, outside accountants and attorneys of any of the foregoing, provided that each such Person is informed of the confidential nature of such information and (except in the case of a Person described in clause (iii) above) agrees to maintain the confidential nature of such information. In addition, the Lenders and the Agents may disclose any such nonpublic information pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, direction, request or order of any judicial, administrative or regulatory authority or proceedings (whether or not having the force or effect of law). (c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each of the Agents and the Lenders hereby confirms that each of the Loan Parties, the Originators and their respective representatives shall not be limited from disclosing the U.S. tax treatment or U.S. tax structure of the transactions evidenced hereby. Section 14.6 Bankruptcy Petition. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Loan Parties, Agents and Lenders hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any of the Conduits, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, any of the Conduits any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States. 52
Section 14.7 Limitation of Liability. Except with respect to any claim arising out of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any Agent, any Lender or JH Management Corporation, no claim may be made by any Loan Party or any other Person against any such Person or any of its respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and each Loan Party hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. Section 14.8 CHOICE OF LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW (EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED THEREIN) AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PERFECTION OF THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF BORROWER OR THE SECURITY INTEREST OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SECURED PARTIES, IN ANY OF THE COLLATERAL IS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Section 14.9 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY LOAN PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY ANY LOAN PARTY AGAINST ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED BY SUCH LOAN PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER. Section 14.11 Integration; Binding Effect; Survival of Terms.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns (including any trustee in bankruptcy). This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms and shall remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that the rights and remedies with respect to (i) any breach of any representation and warranty made by any Loan Party pursuant to Article VI, (ii) the indemnification and payment provisions of Article X, and Sections 14.5 and 14.6 shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
