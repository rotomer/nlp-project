(iv) Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees only for those claims giving rise to Seller Damages as to which the Seller Indemnitees have given Buyer written notice thereof prior to the end of the Indemnity Period, in the event that the Indemnity Period applies to such Seller Damages. Any written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Buyer with respect to Seller Damages shall set forth, with as much specificity as is reasonably practicable, the basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof.
 
 
The obligations of any indemnifying party to indemnify any indemnified party under this Article VII with respect to Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (a ""), will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
Claim
 
(a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted will give the party required to provide indemnity hereunder written notice of any such Claim promptly after learning of such Claim, and the indemnifying party may at its option undertake the defense thereof by representatives of its own choosing. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the indemnifying party's obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice. If the indemnifying party, within thirty (30) days after notice of any such Claim, fails to assume the defense of such Claim, the indemnified party against whom such claim has been made will (upon further notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof; , , that (i) the indemnifying party shall permit the indemnified party to participate in
provided
however
 
such defense, compromise or settlement through counsel chosen by such indemnified party, provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such indemnified party and (ii) the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action only to the extent the indemnifying party acknowledges its indemnity obligation; and, , that the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense, compromise or settlement and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party; (C) the indemnified party has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party; or (E) upon petition by the indemnified party, the appropriate court rules that the indemnifying party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim, that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the indemnifying party for such claim unless the indemnifying party shall have consented to such payment or settlement.
provided
further
provided
 
(b) Anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement, compromise or consent provides for (i) a remedy consisting solely of monetary damages to be borne exclusively by the indemnifying party, and (ii) an unconditional release of the indemnified party in respect of claims underlying such settlement, compromise or consent.
 
 
(a) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Buyer Damages incurred or suffered by Buyer Indemnitees (i) as a result of or arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.17 (without regard to any qualifications therein as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"); (ii) as a consequence of any investigation, remediation or containment of Hazardous Substances that are present or released on or before the Closing at, on, under or about any of the Owned Real Property or any Leased Real Property; (iii) in connection with claims or proceedings by employees and/or third parties in respect of personal injury or property damage as a result of Hazardous Substances that were present or released, on or before the Closing, at, on, under or migrating from, any of the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property; (iv) in connection with violations by Seller (in respect of the Business) of any applicable Environmental Law (including any permits, licenses or other authorizations issued pursuant to such applicable Environmental Law) prior to the Closing; and (v) as a consequence of any off-site disposal of any Hazardous Substance by Seller in the conduct of the Business.
 
(b) Seller's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees for the matters addressed in Section 7.5(a) shall be limited to those matters as to which Buyer provides Seller with written notice (such notice to be in conformance with other relevant provisions of this Agreement and to contain, to the extent available, reasonable details of the claim for which indemnity is sought) within two (2) years after Closing, except that, solely with respect to Buyer Damages suffered as a result of the disposal or arrangement for disposal of any Hazardous Substances by Seller or the Business prior to the Closing Date at locations other than the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real
 
Property, Buyer may provide notice of such claim at any time prior to sixty (60) days following the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.
 
(c) With respect to claims to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees that are described by Section 7.5(a), to the extent such claims involve the containment or remediation of Hazardous Substances at the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property:
 
(i) Seller shall only be required to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees to the extent that: (A) investigation, containment or remediation of the Hazardous Substances is required pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law that is in effect as of and is enforceable as of the Closing; (B) the Remediation Standards that must be met in order to satisfy the requirements of the applicable Environmental Law (1) are no more stringent than the Remediation Standards that were in effect as of and were enforceable as of the Closing Date under the applicable Environmental Law that is the source of the obligation to conduct a remediation, or, where no such Remediation Standards had been promulgated and were enforceable as of the Closing Date, Remediation Standards that were applied, within one (1) year prior to the Closing Date, on a case-by-case basis, to properties that are most similar to the property that is subject to a remediation and (2) are those Remediation Standards that would be the least stringent Remediation Standards, taking into account that the normal operating condition at the affected facility shall be maintained at all times, that would be applicable given the use of the property as of the day before the Closing Date; and (C) such investigation, containment and/or remediation is conducted using reasonably cost effective methods, taking into account that the normal operating condition at the affected facility shall be maintained at all times, for investigation, remediation and/or containment consistent with applicable Environmental Law. To the extent that the Buyer Damages incurred in connection with an investigation, containment or remediation are in excess of the Buyer Damages that would be incurred for an investigation, containment or remediation meeting the conditions set forth in this Section 7.5(c), Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitees for such excess Buyer Damages. If Seller is undertaking remedial action, Seller shall not be responsible for any effect the remediation has upon the business or operations of Buyer (including, without limitation, business interruptions or lost profits).
 
(ii) If the costs of an investigation, containment or remediation at any of the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property that is subject to an indemnity by Seller hereunder are increased due to an act or omission (after the Closing) by a person other than Seller, a subsidiary of Seller, or an agent, representative or contractor of Seller, Seller shall not be responsible for any such increase in costs incurred. Seller shall not be responsible for any increased costs or increased Buyer Damages under this subsection to the extent they arise by reason of (i) the voluntary closure of operations at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property or (ii) a material change in use of any of such property from the use of such property as of the Closing.
 
(iii) No indemnification shall be made by Seller with respect to any claim unless the amount of such claim exceeds $25,000; in such event, indemnification shall be made by Seller for the full amount of such claim.
 
(iv) In no event shall Seller's aggregate obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.5(a), together with any indemnification paid pursuant to any other provisions of this Agreement, exceed an amount equal to 50% of the Purchase Price.
 
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a Buyer Indemnitee has a claim pursuant to Section 7.5(a)(iv) of this Agreement, Seller shall be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless said Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any claims for fines or penalties arising out of said noncompliance and costs or Buyer Damages arising out of any expenditures made or actions taken by said Buyer Indemnitee after the Closing to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable Environmental Laws at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, but only to the extent that such expenditures or actions do not exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The foregoing sentence shall not be interpreted to preclude Buyer Indemnitees from defense and indemnification with respect to the investigation and remediation of Hazardous Substances that are present, on or before the Closing, in any environmental media at, on, under or migrating from, Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, as otherwise authorized pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to claims arising pursuant to Section 7.5, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for the costs and expenses associated with Buyer Indemnitees' overseeing of Seller's performance of its defense and indemnity obligations, including, but not limited to, the costs and expenses of overseeing of Seller's legal counsel, consultants, or employees, and Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for any costs or expenses of Buyer Indemnitees for management and employee time costs.
 
(f) To the extent that Buyer Indemnitees make a claim, pursuant to Section 7.2, for breach of the representation set forth in Section 3.17, the provisions of this Section 7.5 shall apply exclusively to such claim.
 
(g) Claims brought pursuant to this Section 7.5 that constitute "Claims" as defined in Section 7.4, shall be subject to the procedures for indemnification set forth in Section 7.4 if such claims are third party claims. Claims that involve or also involve the investigation, containment and/or remediation of Hazardous Substances at the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property shall also be subject to the procedures of Section 7.6.
 
(h) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "" means a numerical standard (whether resulting from an enacted statute, promulgated regulation, guidance or policy document issued by a regulatory agency, or developed on a case-by-case basis through a risk assessment or other methodology authorized pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law and acceptable to the applicable governmental authority), that defines the concentrations of Hazardous Substances that may be permitted to remain in any environmental media after an investigation, remediation or containment of a release of Hazardous Substances.
Remediation Standard
 
 
(a) Seller shall have the right to control the management of an investigation, containment or remediation of Hazardous Substances at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property that is
 
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer hereby grants Seller reasonable continued access to any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property consistent with such right to control the management of an investigation, containment or remediation. Seller must notify Buyer, within forty-five (45) days of receipt of notice of Buyer's claim for indemnification for such matter, that (i) it intends to undertake such responsibility or (ii) more information is needed from Buyer before Seller can reasonably determine that Buyer's claim is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall promptly respond to such requests for information (to the extent such information is reasonably available to Buyer) and, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such information, Seller shall notify Buyer as to whether it shall undertake the investigation, containment and/or remediation. Prior to a determination by Seller that it will undertake investigation, containment and/or remediation pursuant to this Section 7.6, Buyer shall take only those actions necessary to comply with applicable Environmental Laws and the requirements of governmental authorities or address conditions that pose an immediate and acute environmental or health risk.
 
(b) In undertaking an investigation, containment and/or remediation pursuant to this Section 7.6, Seller shall retain a qualified independent environmental consultant, which consultant shall be subject to Buyer's approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller shall undertake such investigation, containment and/or remediation in a prompt and expeditious fashion in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws and shall not cause, through its own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining written notice from the appropriate regulatory body that no further investigation, containment or remediation is necessary with respect to the matter that is the subject of the indemnification claim, or, if no regulatory body is involved in such matter, a good faith determination from its independent environmental consultant that no further investigation, containment or remediation is required to bring the property that is the subject of the remedial action into conformance with applicable Environmental Laws. Seller shall comply with all applicable laws, including all applicable Environmental Laws, with respect to its performance pursuant to this Section 7.6. In the event that Seller undertakes the performance of an investigation, containment and/or remediation pursuant to this Section 7.6, Seller shall have primary responsibility to interact and negotiate with any governmental authorities having jurisdiction over such investigation, containment and/or remediation. Seller shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give Buyer a reasonable opportunity (at Buyer's own expense) to comment on any submissions Seller intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to such submission. Buyer may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to monitor the investigation, containment and/or remediation, including any field work undertaken by Seller, and Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of the results of all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall not take any actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Seller's performance of the investigation, remediation and/or containment. Seller shall undertake any such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to the extent reasonably possible, with the conduct of operations at the applicable property. Buyer shall allow Seller reasonable access to conduct any of the work contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Seller in the performance of the investigation, remediation or containment, including, but not limited to, providing Seller with reasonable access to employees and documents as Seller reasonably deems necessary.
 
(c) If Seller declines to undertake the performance of an investigation, containment and/or remediation hereunder, Buyer shall be entitled to control the investigation, containment and/or remediation. Buyer shall promptly provide copies to Seller of all notices, correspondence, draft reports,
 
submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give Seller a reasonable opportunity (at Seller's own expense) to comment on any submissions Buyer intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to such submission. Seller may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to monitor the investigation containment and/or remediation, including any field work undertaken by Buyer, and Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of the results of all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, Seller shall not take any actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Buyer's performance of the investigation, containment and/or remediation. Seller's decision to allow Buyer to undertake any such investigation, containment and/or remediation hereunder shall not limit or affect Seller's obligation to indemnify Buyer for such investigation, containment and/or remediation as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer Indemnitees hereby agree that their sole and exclusive remedy against Seller, with respect to any and all matters arising under or related to Environmental Law or Hazardous Substances and with respect to the Business, the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property, shall be the indemnity set forth in Section 7.5. Except with respect to the remedy referred to in the preceding sentence, the Buyer Indemnitees hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, and forever release Seller (with respect to the Business), the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property from, any and all Claims or Seller Damages arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous Substances or the environment.
 
 
(a) .
Tax Indemnification
 
(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnities from and against any liability for Taxes (other than Buyer's share of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 1.10) relating to the Assets attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
 
(ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnities from and against any liability for Taxes (other than Seller's share of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 1.10) relating to the Assets attributable to any taxable period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
 
(iii) To the extent that an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Section 7.8 may overlap with any other indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article VII, the provisions of this Section 7.8 shall govern and control.
 
(iv) The parties hereto agree that any payments made pursuant to the indemnification provisions hereof are intended to be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price; , , that to the extent that any taxing authority successfully characterizes, in a final determination, that any indemnification payments shall be deemed to be income to the party receiving such payments, then the party making such payments shall pay an additional amount to the party receiving such payments to cover appropriate Taxes thereon.
provided
however
 
(b) . Any claim to be made pursuant to this Section 7.8 must be made before the expiration (with valid extensions) of the applicable statutes of limitations related to the Taxes at issue plus sixty (60) days. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.16 shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
