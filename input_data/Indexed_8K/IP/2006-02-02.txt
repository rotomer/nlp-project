 International Paper (NYSE: IP) today reported full-year 2005 net earnings of $1.1 billion ($2.21 per share) compared with a loss of $35 million ($0.07 per share) in 2004. The company posted a fourth quarter 2005 net loss of $77 million ($0.16 per share) compared with earnings of $169 million ($0.35 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $1.0 billion ($2.03 per share) in the third quarter of 2005. The above amounts include the effects of special items in all periods.
STAMFORD, Conn.  Feb. 2, 2006
 
 
Full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations and before special items were $524 million ($1.08 per share), compared with $618 million ($1.26 per share) for the 2004 full year. Earnings from continuing operations and before special items in the 2005 fourth quarter were $58 million ($0.12 per share), compared with $205 million ($0.42 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $139 million ($0.29 per share) in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Net sales increased in both the 2005 fourth quarter and full year. Fourth-quarter net sales rose to $6.1 billion from $6.0 billion in both the fourth quarter of 2004 and the third quarter 2005. Full-year 2005 net sales were $24.1 billion compared with $23.4 billion in 2004.
 
Operating profits of $397 million for the 2005 fourth quarter were lower than third-quarter 2005 operating profits of $489 million, mainly because of high input costs. Full-year 2005 operating profits were $1.9 billion versus $2.0 billion in 2004.
 
"Input costs skyrocketed in the fourth quarter, especially in October and November," said John Faraci, IP chairman and chief executive officer. "They were above the already high year-to-date levels  this put a big dent in our margins. Volumes, however, were better than we expected in the fourth quarter, especially in containerboard and printing papers.
 
"For 2005 in total, high costs for energy, wood and other raw materials had a $585 million negative impact on earnings versus 2004  that's about $0.87 per share. Volumes were also down in 2005, despite some fourth-quarter upturn. We took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in the year, including the closure of the Ft. Madison, Iowa, medium mill in third quarter and the permanent shutdown of three uncoated freesheet machines in the fourth quarter," Faraci said. "The good news is that we were able to partially offset some of the negative impacts through operational improvements and year-over-year pricing improvements. So while our results aren't yet where they need to be, we are taking the right steps to generate improved results long term."
 
Commenting on the first quarter of 2006, Faraci said, "We expect first quarter results to be flat with fourth quarter, with somewhat lower earnings from land sales. While natural gas prices are trending down, costs for chemicals and fuel oil are trending up from already high levels in fourth quarter, so we expect overall input costs to be about flat. Given this continued cost pressure, operational improvement remains a priority. We expect volumes to be seasonally slow early in the quarter, with some pick-up in March. However, I feel good about the dynamics of what's happening in our businesses right now, as we gained some price momentum late in the fourth quarter that we expect will carry into first quarter, particularly in our printing papers and packaging businesses."
