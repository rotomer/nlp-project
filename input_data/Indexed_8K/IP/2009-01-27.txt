[TITLE]
[ADDRESS]
Dear [First Name]:
International Paper Company (the "") considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In this connection, the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change of control may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among senior management, may result in the departure or distraction of senior management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Company's Board of Directors has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's senior management, including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change of control of the Company.
Company
