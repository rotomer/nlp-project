On March 12, 2009, International Paper Investments (Luxembourg) S. r.l. ("Borrower"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of International Paper Company ("IP"), entered into a Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") by and among the Borrower, IP as guarantor, the Lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") and BNP Paribas ("BNPP") as administrative agent.
On March 12, 2009 the Lenders provided a loan (the "Loan") to the Borrower in the principal amount of $468 million. The maturity date of the Loan is March 12, 2012.
Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Borrower, (a) the alternative base rate (defined as a rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate announced publicly by BNPP in New York, NY as BNPP's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) for a one-month interest period plus 1%), or (b) LIBOR; in either case plus a margin to be determined by reference to the long-term credit rating of IP issued by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
The Loan Agreement contains certain negative covenants (including a prohibition on fundamental changes of IP and a limitation on liens IP may incur) and financial covenants (including a covenant not to permit at any time the ratio of Total Debt to Total Capital to exceed 0.60 to 1, and a covenant not to permit at any time the Consolidated Net Worth to be less than $9 billion), with all such capitalized terms defined in the Loan Agreement. The affirmative covenants and events of default in the Loan Agreement are substantially similar to those contained in IP's $3 billion Credit Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2008, among IP, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
The foregoing description of the Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Loan Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On March 13, 2009, IP used the $468 million of proceeds from the Loan Agreement and cash of approximately $170 million to repay all of the Euro denominated 500 million five-year credit facility ("Euro Loan") that had a maturity date of August 6, 2009. The Euro Loan was among International Paper Investments (France) S.A.S. as borrower, IP as guarantor, BNPP, Barclays Capital and ABN AMRO N.V., as mandated lead arrangers, certain financial institutions named therein and BNPP as facility agent.

Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against any Obligor's rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Obligor in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
 
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to or , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Neither the Guarantor nor any of its Subsidiaries had on said dates any material contingent liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments, except as referred to or reflected or provided for in said balance sheets as at said date.

(iv) no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which the Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries is or will be named as a party, nor are any of them subject to any consent decree, or consent order or other orders or judgments under any Environmental Law;
(v) there has been no Release or threat of Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from any properties or facilities currently, or to the knowledge of the Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries, formerly, owned or operated by any of them which would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of or liability under any Environmental Laws on the part of any of them; and

(b) . In the ordinary course of its business, the Guarantor conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes or hazardous substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, the Guarantor has reasonably concluded that, except as expressly disclosed in the Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, such associated liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
