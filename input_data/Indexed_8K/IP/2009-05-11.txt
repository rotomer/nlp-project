Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, including any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an
 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus: under the caption "Underwriting": third and eighth paragraphs; provided, however, that the Underwriters shall not be liable for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's failure to perform its obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that the failure to so notify has materially prejudiced the rights of the indemnifying party under this Agreement. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified party and it shall have notified the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying person) to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying
 
party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, and any such separate firm for the Company and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person, from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
pro rata
 
damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes any persons substituted for a Underwriter under this Section 9. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or termination of this Agreement, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person,

If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated as contemplated herein for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or the occurrence of any event specified in the second sentence of Section 7(d), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

Section 2.07. .
Interest
(a) The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.07(c), from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year (each, an ""), commencing on November 15, 2009, to the Person in whose name such Note or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be the close of business on the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a
Interest Payment Date
 
Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, and at the foregoing respective rates on overdue principal.
(b) The amount of interest payable for any period less than a full interest period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual days elapsed in a partial month in such period. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was originally payable.
(c) The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes in the manner described below:
(i) If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate payable on the Notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth opposite that rating:
 
(ii) If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate payable on the Notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth opposite that rating:
 
(iii) If at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Notes will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date plus the percentage points set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the rating increase. If Moody's
 
 
(or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Notes will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date. In addition, the interest rates on the Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both such rating agencies) if the Notes become rated A3 (stable or better) and A- (stable or better) (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one such rating agency).
(iv) Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00 percentage points above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date.
(v) No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Notes. If at any time less than two rating agencies provide a rating of the Notes for a reason beyond the Company's control, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the tables above, (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Notes will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date plus the appropriate percentage points, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage points resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one rating agency provides a rating of the Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage points set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00 percentage points above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the Issue Date.
(vi) Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding a rating change which requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
(vii) Promptly after any change in the interest rate borne by the Notes as provided above, the Company shall give the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the interest
 
rate borne by the Notes has changed in accordance with this Section 2.07(c) and setting forth the amount of the related increase or decrease and the new interest rate borne by the Notes.
(viii) If the interest rate payable on the Notes is increased pursuant to this Section 2.07(c), the term "interest," as used in the Indenture with respect to the Notes, as supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires. If the Company defeases or discharges the Indenture in accordance with Section 4.1 of the Indenture, or the Notes or certain obligations related thereto in accordance with Sections 4.3 and 10.11 of the Indenture and Section 2.10 hereof, there will be no further adjustment in the interest rate on the Notes after such defeasance or discharge.
(ix) The following term has the meaning given to it in this Section 2.07(c)(ix):
"" means a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Company and delivered to the Trustee) as a replacement agency for Moody's, S&P or another Substitute Rating Agency, or all of them, as the case may be.
