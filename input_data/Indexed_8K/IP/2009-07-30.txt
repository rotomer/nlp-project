News Release
International Paper (NYSE: IP) today reported preliminary 2009 second-quarter net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $136 million ($0.32 per share) compared with $257 million ($0.61 per share) in the first quarter of 2009 and $227 million ($0.54 per share) in the second quarter of 2008. Amounts in all periods include special items.
MEMPHIS, Tenn.  July 30, 2009 
 
Earnings from continuing operations and before special items in the 2009 second quarter totaled $86 million ($0.20 per share), compared with $34 million ($0.08 per share) in the first quarter of 2009 and $235 million ($0.56 per share) in the second quarter of 2008.
Quarterly net sales were $5.8 billion in the second quarter compared with $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2009 and $5.8 billion reported in the second quarter of 2008.
Operating profits in the 2009 second quarter were $788 million, up from $779 million in the first quarter of 2009 and $393 million in the second quarter of 2008.
"Over the course of this recession, International Paper has consistently demonstrated our ability to execute well despite the economic environment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Faraci. "Our performance in the second quarter once again generated solid earnings and strong free cash flow. We're also well ahead of our announced plans to pay down debt.
"When we look at global economic conditions today, it appears the worst is behind us. We have not seen any signs of sustainable progress in North America, but it appears demand has stabilized at lower levels. We are seeing improvement in Latin American paper markets and solid packaging demand growth in China. The good news is that mill and channel inventories are lean for both paper and containerboard, which positions us well for the eventual upturn in demand."
 
At the end of the 2009 second quarter, International Paper had $4.2 billion in cash and committed liquidity facilities. The company also generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow (cash provided by operations less capital expenditures) during the quarter, reflecting its continued focus on reducing capital spending, managing working capital and decreasing overhead spending, as well as cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits. The company also repaid $600 million of debt.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
To measure the performance of the company's business segments from quarter to quarter without variations caused by special or unusual items, management focuses on business segment operating profits excluding those items. Second-quarter 2009 segment operating profits and business trends, excluding special items, compared with the prior quarter are as follows:
operating profits increased to $255 million, up from $188 million in the first quarter of 2009 as improved volume, favorable input costs, strong manufacturing operations and synergy benefits related to the CBPR acquisition offset weakened pricing.
Industrial Packaging
had operating profits of $86 million compared with an operating profit of $101 million in the first quarter of 2009. Benefits from improved volume, input cost relief and strong operations were offset by higher annual maintenance outages, mix and pricing pressure in global paper and pulp markets.
Printing Papers
had operating profits of $38 million, up from $22 million in the previous quarter due to improvements in volume and operating performance, as well as lower input costs, partially offset by higher annual maintenance outages.
Consumer Packaging
The company's distribution business, , reported operating profits of $10 million, up from a loss of $7 million in the previous quarter due to cost reductions and improved volumes.
xpedx
operating profits totaled $3 million, up from $2 million in the first quarter of 2009. The pending sale of 143,000 acres is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009, subject to the buyer's receipt of financing.
Forest Products
Net corporate expenses totaled $44 million for the 2009 second quarter, down from $51 million in the 2009 first quarter but up from $21 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decline compared with first-quarter levels principally reflects the finalization of full-year 2009 pension expense based on actual versus estimated year-end census data. The increase from the 2008 second quarter reflects higher pension expense, lower supply chain initiative costs and the effect of an $11 million gain on the sale of the former Natchez mill site in 2008.
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
The effective tax rate from continuing operations and before special items was 33 percent for both the second and first quarters of 2009 compared with 32.5 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
 
EFFECTS OF SPECIAL ITEMS
Special items in the second quarter of 2009 included a credit of $482 million before taxes ($294 million after taxes) for alternative fuel mixture credits earned under 2007 legislation enacted to provide a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses, a $48 million before and after-tax charge to write down the assets of the Etienne mill in France to estimated fair value, a $18 million pre-tax charge ($11 million after taxes) for integration costs associated with the Industrial Packaging business integration, and a pre-tax charge of $79 million ($55 million after taxes) for restructuring and other charges.

These statements reflect management's current views and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ relate to: (i) increases in interest rates and our ability to meet our debt service obligations; (ii) industry conditions, including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation costs, competition we face, cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences, demand and pricing for its products; (iii) global economic conditions and political changes, including but not limited to the impairment of financial institutions, changes in currency exchange rates, credit availability, credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations, the amount of our future pension funding obligation, changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs; (iv) unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation; and (v) whether we experience a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities and risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of this consolidated statement of operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes:
(1) The Company calculates Earnings Before Special Items by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(2) Diluted earnings per common share reflect the inclusion of contingently convertible securities in the computation.
(3) Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, six-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of the respective quarters.
