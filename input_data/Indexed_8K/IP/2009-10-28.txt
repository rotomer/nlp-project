MEMPHIS, Tenn.  Oct. 28, 2009 
 
Earnings from continuing operations and before special items in the 2009 third quarter totaled $157 million ($0.37 per share), compared with $86 million ($0.20 per share) in the second quarter of 2009 and $356 million ($0.84 per share) in the third quarter of 2008.
Quarterly net sales were $5.9 billion in the third quarter compared with $5.8 billion in the second quarter of 2009 and $6.8 billion reported in the third quarter of 2008.
Operating profits in the 2009 third quarter were $940 million, up from $788 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $536 million in the third quarter of 2008.
At the end of the 2009 third quarter, International Paper had $4.2 billion in cash and committed liquidity facilities. The company generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow (cash provided by operations less capital expenditures) during the quarter, reflecting its continued focus on reducing costs, managing capacity and working capital, and continued reduced capital spending, as well as cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits. The company also repaid $1.3 billion of debt during the quarter.
"At the end of the third quarter, we began to see some modest improvements in demand in some segments of our paper and packaging businesses," said Chairman and CEO John Faraci. "We expanded margins year-over-year and continued to deliver strong cash flow and pay down debt, and I'm confident we're in position to benefit as the economy continues to slowly recover."
 
SEGMENT INFORMATION
To measure the performance of the company's business segments from quarter to quarter without variations caused by special or unusual items, management focuses on business segment operating profits excluding those items. Third-quarter 2009 segment operating profits and business trends, excluding special items, compared with the prior quarter are as follows:
operating profits were $214 million, down from $255 million in the second quarter of 2009 as lower annual maintenance outages and modest volume improvement were offset by lower box prices.
Industrial Packaging
had operating profits of $138 million compared with operating profits of $86 million in the second quarter of 2009. Improved volume, lower input costs and favorable operations offset unfavorable mix as export sales increased.
Printing Papers
had operating profits of $68 million, up from $38 million in the previous quarter as lower annual maintenance outages, modest volume improvements and favorable input costs and operations offset pricing pressure.
Consumer Packaging
The company's distribution business, , reported operating profits of $21 million, up from $10 million in the previous quarter, due to improved volumes and cost reductions.
xpedx
operating profits totaled $2 million, down from $3 million in the second quarter of 2009. The pending sale of 143,000 acres is not expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009 although interested parties are continuing their due diligence efforts.
Forest Products
Net corporate expenses totaled $46 million for the 2009 third quarter compared with $44 million in the 2009 second quarter and $40 million in the third quarter of 2008. The slight increase versus the 2009 second quarter was due to slightly higher pension expense, while the increase from the 2008 third quarter reflects higher pension expense, partially offset by lower supply chain initiative costs.
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
The effective tax rate from continuing operations and before special items was 30 percent for the 2009 third quarter, lower than 33 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and 32.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008. The lower rate in the 2009 third quarter reflects adjustments of prior-year income tax estimates upon the filing of the company's 2008 income tax return.
EFFECTS OF SPECIAL ITEMS
Special items in the third quarter of 2009 included a $525 million pre-tax credit ($320 million after taxes) for alternative fuel mixture credits earned under 2007 legislation enacted to provide a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce renewable energy to operate their businesses, a $18 million pre-tax charge ($11 million after taxes) for integration costs associated with the Industrial Packaging business integration, and a pre-tax charge of $151 million ($95 million after taxes) for restructuring and other charges.

Notes:
The Company calculates Earnings Before Special Items by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(1)
Diluted earnings per common share reflect the inclusion of contingently convertible securities in the computation.
(2)
Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, nine-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of the respective quarters.
