On May 14, 2010, two executive officers of International Paper Company (the "Company"), John V. Faraci, Chairman and CEO, and Carol L. Roberts, Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging, each established a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (the "Trading Plan") to sell a portion of their respective holdings of Company common stock as part of their personal financial planning strategies for asset diversification and liquidity. Their individual Trading Plans are described below.
Mr. Faraci's Trading Plan provides for the sale of up to 285,000 shares of his Company stock and up to 37,000 shares that he may acquire upon exercise of employee stock options that expire on October 10, 2010. The exercise price of those options is currently above the Company's stock price. Planned sales under his Trading Plan will commence no earlier than June 14, 2010, provided that the price of Company stock achieves specified levels. His Trading Plan terminates on October 8, 2010, with regard to employee stock options, and on December 31, 2011, with regard to Company stock.
Ms. Roberts' Trading Plan provides for the sale of up to 50,010 shares of her Company stock. Planned sales under her Trading Plan will commence no earlier than June 14, 2010, provided that the price of Company stock achieves specified levels. Her Trading Plan terminates on June 14, 2011.
10b5-1 Plans Generally
Each of the Trading Plans described above were adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company's policies regarding transactions in its securities. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Once a plan is established, the individual retains no discretion over purchases or sales under the plan, and the transactions are executed through a broker on or after specified dates, whether or not the individual subsequently acquires material non-public information about the company.
Any transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission when due.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
