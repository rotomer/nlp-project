News Release
International Paper (NYSE: IP) today reported preliminary second-quarter 2010 net earnings attributable to common shareholders totaling $93 million ($0.21 per share) compared with a net loss of $162 million ($0.38 per share) in the first quarter of 2010 and net earnings of $136 million ($0.32 per share) in the second quarter of 2009. Amounts in all periods include special items.
MEMPHIS, Tenn.  July 28, 2010 
 
Earnings before special items in the 2010 second quarter totaled $181 million ($0.42 per share), compared with $16 million ($0.04 per share) in the first quarter of 2010 and $86 million ($0.20 per share) in the second quarter of 2009.
Quarterly net sales were $6.1 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2010 and $5.8 billion reported in the second quarter of 2009.
Operating profits in the second quarter were $353 million, up from $20 million in the first quarter of 2010. Both amounts reflect the inclusion of special items.
"Each of our businesses posted strong results in the second quarter, leading to the significant increase in earnings per share and solid free cash flow," said John Faraci, chairman and chief executive officer. "Operating rates are strong, inventories are low, and input costs are moderating. All of these factors position us well for a stronger third quarter."
 
SEGMENT INFORMATION
To measure the performance of the company's business segments from quarter to quarter without variations caused by special items, management focuses on business segment operating profits excluding those items. Second quarter 2010 business segment operating profits and business trends compared with the prior quarter are as follows:
operating profits (excluding special items) increased to $193 million as compared with $46 million in the first quarter of 2010. Earnings improved mainly from increases in linerboard and North America box demand, fewer mill outages and further realization of announced price increases. Operating profits after special items were $192 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $41 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Industrial Packaging
had an operating profit (excluding special items) of $158 million as compared with $126 million in the first quarter of 2010. Results were positively impacted by favorable pulp and paper pricing, and improved operations more than offsetting higher mill outage costs. Operating profits after special items were $47 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with a loss of $78 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Printing Papers
had an operating profit (excluding special items) of $49 million compared with $31 million in the first quarter of 2010. Results were positively impacted by higher volumes, further realization of announced coated paperboard price increases and stronger operations, partially offset by planned maintenance outages and relatively higher input costs. Operating profits after special items were $48 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $28 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Consumer Packaging
The company's distribution business, , reported operating profits of $26 million, up from $21 million in the first quarter of 2010. The earnings improvement was primarily driven by stronger volumes, lower costs and improved margins. There were no special items recorded in either quarter.
xpedx
operating profits totaled $40 million, up from $8 million in the prior quarter due to a mineral rights sale. There were no special items recorded in either quarter.
Forest Products
Net corporate expenses totaled $54 million for the 2010 second quarter, essentially in line with the $51 million recorded in the 2010 first quarter.
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
The effective tax rate before special items for the second quarter of 2010 was 31 percent, compared with 32 percent in the first quarter of 2010. The tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 is representative of the forecasted annual effective tax rate.

Notes:
(1) The Company calculates Earnings Before Special Items by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(2) Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, six-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of the respective quarters.
