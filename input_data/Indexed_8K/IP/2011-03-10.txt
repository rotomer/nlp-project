Three Senior Vice Presidents of International Paper Company (the "Company"), Mr. Tim S. Nicholls, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Tommy S. Joseph and Mr. Mark S.

Their individual Trading Plans are described below.
Mr. Nicholls' Trading Plan provides for the sale of up to 65,000 shares of his Company stock. Planned sales under his Trading Plan will commence no earlier than May 10, 2011, provided that the price of Company stock achieves specified levels.

10b5-1 Plans Generally
Each of the Trading Plans described above were adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company's policies regarding transactions in its securities. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Once a plan is established, the individual retains no discretion over purchases or sales under the plan, and the transactions are executed through a broker on or after specified dates, whether or not the individual subsequently acquires material non-public information about the Company.
Any transactions under these Trading Plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission when due.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
