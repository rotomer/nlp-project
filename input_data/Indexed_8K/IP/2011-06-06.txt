Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
 
 International Paper (NYSE: IP) today announced that it has proposed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Temple-Inland (NYSE: TIN) for $30.60 per share in cash. Under the terms of the proposal, the offer represents a 44% premium to Temple-Inland's price as of noon EDT, June 6
MEMPHIS, Tenn., June 6th, 2011
th
, 2011 ($21.21). International Paper's offer, which is backed by committed financing from UBS Investment Bank, is contingent on appropriate documentation and regulatory approval, which International Paper believes can be obtained.
International Paper first communicated its proposal verbally to the chairman of Temple-Inland on May 17th, 2011. Subsequently, there has been a call, a face-to-face meeting between the two sides and two letters of correspondence from the chairman of International Paper to the chairman of Temple-Inland. International Paper was informed in a letter from Temple-Inland's chairman dated June 4, 2011 that the Board of Temple-Inland has unanimously rejected International Paper's proposal. In response, International Paper today sent a letter to Temple-Inland expressing its continued interest in pursuing an acquisition (the full text of that letter is below).
International Paper chairman and CEO John Faraci said, "We are very disappointed with the response of Temple-Inland's Board of Directors. We believe that our proposal offers clearly superior and compelling value to Temple-Inland's shareholders. Our proposal reflects the future business plans and economic outlook for Temple-Inland and for the sector, and incorporates a significant portion of the cost savings resulting from the merger of International Paper and Temple-Inland, while at the same time creating value for International Paper shareholders."
The offer reflects the potential cyclical improvement in Temple-Inland's building products segment and International Paper's willingness to share a portion of the significant synergies available from the transaction with Temple-Inland shareholders. International Paper is prepared to consider all alternatives to successfully complete this transaction.

The letter sent to Temple Inland from International Paper is attached
June 6, 2011
Mr. Doyle R. Simons
Chairman & CEO
Temple-Inland, Inc.

Austin, TX 78746
Dear Doyle:
International Paper is very disappointed by your Board's rejection of our proposal to acquire Temple-Inland for $30.60 per share in cash, which represents a 44% premium to your market price at noon EDT today ($21.21). We continue to believe that our proposal represents a highly attractive offer for Temple-Inland and fairly rewards your shareholders for potential future operational and cyclical improvement as well as the potential synergies in a combination of our two businesses. Given the complete lack of interest expressed by your Board's unanimous rejection of our proposal, we are compelled to take our offer directly to your shareholders.
Following our initial proposal communicated by telephone on May 17
th
and our face-to-face discussion on May 26
th
, we did not receive a substantive response until June 4
th
- almost three weeks after our initial contact. We believe your refusal to engage in discussions with us reflects an unrealistic view of the outlook for your portfolio of businesses, especially given the slow growth of the packaging industry and the low likelihood of a meaningful rebound in building products for at least the next several years.
The Temple-Inland recovery program referenced in your letter, including your focus on ROI, Box Plant Transformation I & II, the current industry dynamics and the cost structure of your building products operation, are already, in our judgment, fully reflected in your share price. Our ability to provide a cash offer at more than a 40% premium to market reflects not only the quality and fundamentals of your existing business, but also a very substantial portion of the significant cost savings that would result from the combination of the businesses and that are not otherwise available to you  and it gives all of that value to your shareholders immediately in cash, while ensuring a fair return for our own stockholders. After all, based on the information available in the public domain, the highest analyst forecast for your share price in the next 12-18 months is $29 per share.
Our offer is also at a price well above other relevant data points. Based on analyst consensus estimates, the offer multiple of 9.2x 2011E EBITDA (including $385 million timber monetization liability as well as $828 million of net debt including minority interest, both of which we believe are correct) is materially above that paid by us to Weyerhaeuser for their corrugated packaging business and that paid by Rock-Tenn to Smurfit-Stone. As the two most recent transactions in this
sector, we disagree with your characterization that these two transactions are not comparable to our proposal. In fact, our valuation fully accounts for the fundamental differences between your company and these two other companies as reflected by the very significant premium in our proposal.
It is important to underscore that since January 2008 your return to shareholders, including reinvested dividends, has been only 6% per year. In that context, our proposal allows your shareholders to realize today, in cash, all of the potential future benefits that you may, or may not, deliver through cyclical and operational improvement.
This is the right time for you and the Temple-Inland Board to reconsider our proposed transaction. The economic recovery is slow. This in turn implies a slow recovery in packaging markets and box demand. In addition, the continued difficult housing market conditions mean that it is highly unlikely that your building products segment will be able to deliver significant earnings improvement, at least for the next few years. It would be in the best interests of Temple-Inland and your customers, employees, shareholders and other constituents for you to accept our proposal in a mutually beneficial negotiated transaction.
Your characterization of the regulatory issues in your letter is incorrect. We have studied these issues very thoroughly with the assistance of outside, independent experts. We believe we can obtain all required approvals, and we would be able to demonstrate this to you if you simply agreed to engage with us. We have also suggested repeatedly that a simple confirmatory due diligence process would lead to achieving the best price for your shareholders. We could complete our confirmatory due diligence and finalize the terms of a transaction in a few days.
In order to move forward quickly, we have retained Evercore Partners and UBS Investment Bank as our financial advisors and Debevoise & Plimpton as our legal advisor, which, alongside our senior management, have already completed extensive analysis and due diligence based on publicly available information. We have also obtained a debt financing commitment from UBS Investment Bank in an amount sufficient to consummate this transaction.
International Paper is committed to a transaction with Temple-Inland. Given the substantial value represented by our offer and the unique benefits of a transaction with us, we are confident that Temple-Inland's shareholders will support our proposal. We have taken the step of making this letter public to explain directly to your shareholders our proposal, our actions and our commitment. Your refusal to engage with us will only further delay the ability of your shareholders to receive the substantial value represented by our all-cash offer.
We are ready to meet with you and your team immediately to discuss next steps toward achieving a friendly, negotiated transaction.
Yours sincerely,

Dear John:
The Board of Directors of Temple-Inland has received your letters dated May 19 and May 27,2011 containing IP's proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Temple- Inland for $30.60 per share in cash. The Board has also considered the additional information you provided me at our meeting held at your request on May 26. Earlier today, the Temple- Inland Board of Directors convened and carefully reviewed your company's proposal with the assistance of its financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and its legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. After thorough consideration, it is the unanimous view of the Temple- Inland Board of Directors that your unsolicited proposal grossly undervalues Temple-Inland and its future prospects. Accordingly, the Temple-Inland Board unanimously rejects IP's proposal of $30.60 per share.
Since we launched the "new" Temple-Inland in January 2008, we have delivered superior results to our stockholders compared with our corrugated packaging peers (including IP), building products peers, and the S&P 500. Since that time, our total returns to stockholders of 22% greatly exceed the 5% total return that IP has achieved. Through our proven ability to execute our strategy focused on maximizing return on investment (ROI) and profitably growing our business, the Board believes the Company will continue to provide superior results for our stockholders.
A key part of our strategy is to maximize ROI, because we believe ROI is fundamental to driving stockholder value. In corrugated packaging, we generated record ROI of 16.5% in 2009 and 2010 and are positioned to generate significantly higher levels of ROI in 2011 and beyond due to fundamental changes in the industry and benefits from our box plant transformation. Indeed, we are now achieving the highest returns on assets in the corrugated packaging industry. Despite the worst housing markets since the Great Depression, our low-cost building products operation has continued to generate positive cash flow throughout the downturn and is positioned to generate very high levels of return for our stockholders when housing markets recover. As the economic recovery continues and the benefits from our strategy continue to be realized, it is the stockholders of Temple-Inland who should benefit from our company's very strong prospects, not the stockholders of IP.

We take issue with a number of claims in the materials you have provided to us. You have overstated our net debt by $91 million (which was $737 million as of March 31, 2011, rather than the $828 million stated in your proposal) and the net present value of our timber finance liability by at least $200 million. More significantly, the "comparable" transactions you cite are simply not comparable  those transactions involved troubled or struggling companies or operations rather than a company such as Temple-Inland with its industry-leading returns, high-quality assets and low-cost structure. Further, the retrospective focus of these "comparables" does not take account of the profound changes that are occurring in the corrugated packaging industry, which have led to reduced pricing volatility, higher average prices and widely-held expectations that these positive industry trends will continue.
Your own public statements acknowledge the changes in the industry and make clear that "looking back at history" is not the correct way to understand the corrugated packaging industry's future. If, as you so clearly state, the past is not prologue for your company, neither is it for ours. We believe that it is for this reason that your letter of May 27 insistently says "Timing and speed are important," and you have threatened us with a hostile bid if we do not respond by your deadline. The speed that is "important" to you underscores an opportunistic attempt to deprive our stockholders of the value in their company that we believe will become increasingly evident as the benefits of profound change in the corrugated packaging industry, Box Plant Transformation II and our extremely low-cost building products business accrue to the benefit of our stockholders. Finally, the "certain" value you refer to overlooks the serious regulatory issues of your proposal, an attempt to forcibly combine the #1 and #3 participants in the corrugated packaging industry with the result that your company would have an approximate 40% share of industry capacity, nearly double the next largest competitor.
Our Board of Directors, our management team and our employees are dedicated to creating value for all of our stockholders, which we expect to do by continuing to effectively execute on our strategic plan.

PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL
Mr. Doyle R. Simons
Chairman & CEO
Temple-Inland Inc.
1300 South Mopac Expressway
Austin, TX 78746
Dear Doyle:
Thanks for meeting me yesterday and reviewing our materials. As you can see, we believe our $30.60 all-cash proposal provides compelling value for Nickel's shareholders. I hope that your Board of Directors sees it the same way and I look forward to hearing back from you no later than Saturday, June 4th, which is the 10 days we discussed. Timing and speed are important. If the situation changes and we conclude that we are unable to wait for your response on June 4th, we'll let you know.
The critical issue here is the certainty of receiving a significant immediate cash premium for Nickel shareholders versus waiting years for a recovery in building products, and hoping that the industrial packaging business will maintain or improve during that same period of time. Your stock price would have to reach almost $43 per share in three years to equal the present value of our offer today, as shown on page 5 of our Discussion Materials. That is not likely.
Our proposal represents almost a 20% premium to the highest share price Nickel has seen since it became an independent company as shown on page 4 of the Discussion Materials (which happens to be the current 52-week high), more than a 33% premium to the current price, and a price well above other relevant data points. More specifically, the premium we are offering is in excess of the 27% premium paid by Rock-Tenn to Smurfit Stone and above the 29% average premium of all cash transactions in the sector. Furthermore, the implied multiple of 2011E EBITDA of 9.2x (including $385 million timber monetization liability, or 8.5x excluding) is well above that paid by us to Weyerhaeuser of 6.3x (which was an asset deal and had significant tax advantages which are not available here) and also well above that paid by Rock-Tenn to Smurfit Stone of 6.1x, giving full credit for the quality of Nickel's assets compared to those of SSCC. All of these comparable transactions are outlined on page 6 of the Discussion Materials.
You have done a good job of developing Nickel over the past 4 years. However, not only does our proposal provide your shareholders the certainty of realizing the future benefits that you may or may not be able to deliver to them through a cyclical housing recovery and operational improvements, it more importantly pays them for much of the very significant synergies of a combination that are not achievable on a standalone basis - and it gives it to them immediately in cash. We hope that your Board will evaluate all of these considerations when it meets next week.
In closing, we prefer to effect this transaction on a friendly basis and look forward to your response within the timeframe we discussed. But my Board has thoroughly reviewed this matter and we are resolute in our interest. If a friendly agreement is not possible, we intend to take our proposal directly to your shareholders. I look forward to hearing back from you soon about next steps in making this combination happen quickly and on a friendly basis.
Very truly yours,

North American containerboard supply/demand has been
tight in 2010-11, which could attract greenfield and converted
tonnage to the market. If this tonnage is greater than our
forecast, it could result in a weaker pricing environment and
lower earnings for Nickel and other containerboard
producers.
 Citi, April 2011
We rate [Nickel] shares as Neutral, but are positive about the
fundamentals of the company given [Nickel's] leverage to
containerboard and its strong execution and potential for free
cash flow to accelerate in 2012 as capex declines post the
completion of BPT II. However, we prefer exposure to
International Paper (IP) and Domtar (UFS)  rated Buy 
where we see more compelling FCF generation and capital
allocation in 2011.
 GS, February 2011
We remain cautious on the timing of a housing recovery,
which is an important element to the relative Nickel story;
and, with valuation at a premium to peers, we think that our
expected pace of recovery is appropriately priced in.

Dear Doyle:
Thank you for returning my call yesterday. I look forward to meeting with you next Thursday in Austin. As I said on the phone, I'm sending this letter to summarize International Paper's offer to acquire Temple-Inland and the strong rationale behind it. As discussed, IP is prepared to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Temple-Inland for $30.60 per share in cash, or a total of $4.2 billion, including the assumption of Temple-Inland's debt. Our strong preference is to reach a mutually beneficial, negotiated transaction promptly.
Our offer represents a 30% premium to Temple-Inland's closing share price yesterday, which is also very close to the average closing price of $23.40 for the past 30 days, and almost a 20% premium to its 52-week high.
We believe the combination of IP and Temple-Inland creates an exceptionally compelling opportunity to create value for both of our companies' stockholders. Temple-Inland's stockholders will benefit from immediate liquidity at a price and premium fully reflecting Temple-Inland's value. Furthermore, the significant premium we have proposed reflects our view that we can realize substantial cost savings from combining our businesses, particularly in operations, freight, logistics, selling expense and overhead. Our proposed price shares a meaningful amount of these synergies with Temple-Inland stockholders, while ensuring a fair return for our own stockholders.
Our offer price is based solely on publicly available information. As part of a private negotiation, we would conduct limited due diligence that we expect would take about five days. Our areas of focus would be segment P&L's so we can confirm potential cost savings and capital expenditure requirements.
As I mentioned, we have carefully reviewed the regulatory implications of this combination and are confident that we will receive all required approvals. We are willing to discuss appropriate contractual provisions that will reflect our commitment to completing the transaction.

We have obtained financing commitments in an amount sufficient to consummate this transaction. In addition, we have met with the rating agencies and believe we would remain investment grade with no change in outlook.
International Paper's board of directors fully supports and is committed to this proposal. In addition, we believe your stockholders will embrace this acquisition as a unique opportunity to realize certainty of value today and a premium price that your stock might otherwise take years to reach, if ever, as a stand-alone company.
I look forward to our meeting next week to discuss IP's proposal and next steps.
