actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 6.03. . Any indemnification under this Article VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 of this Article VI, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director, officer or employee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification

For purposes of any determination under Section 6.03 of this Article VI, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The terms "another enterprise" or "other enterprise" as used in this Article VI shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enter price of which such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 6.04 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 of this Article VI, as the case may be.

The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 of this Article VI, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 6.03 of this Article VI nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director, officer or employee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be given to the corporation promptly upon the filing of such application.
Section 6.06. . Expenses incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer or employee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.
Expenses Payable in Advance
Section 6.07. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of this Article VI shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 of this Article VI but whom the corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses

Certain Definitions
 
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees, so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director, officer or employee of such constituent corporation or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any such subsidiary or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

Section 6.10. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
Section 6.11. . The Bylaw amendments of November 2009 revised the previous sections of this Article VI to exclude references to Guaranty Bank (f/k/a Guaranty Federal Savings Bank) merely to remove references to an entity that, as of December 28, 2007, was no longer a subsidiary of the corporation. Such amendments were not intended to provide indemnification or advancement rights to anyone previously excluded from indemnification by the references to Guaranty Bank that were removed. The indemnification or advancement rights of persons who formerly served as officers, directors, or employees of any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the corporation under this Article VI do not apply to any person who served as an officer, director, or employee of Guaranty Bank or any of its subsidiaries regardless of when a claim or action may be threatened or brought against the person or the occurrence underlying the claim or action occurred.

Note to All Employees
A Message From The Chairman
Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to share the news today that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Temple-Inland for $32.00 per share, or approximately $4.3 billion in total, including assumed debt. We were able to negotiate directly with Temple Inland's leadership team to reach an agreement that adds value to both IP and Temple Inland shareholders.
As I've shared with you since we made the offer public on June 6, this combination is consistent with International Paper's focus on achieving and sustaining cost of capital returns throughout the cycle. Temple's low-cost mills and complementary converting system offer significant synergy savings opportunities, and this combination brings together two strong North American corrugated packaging businesses better positioned to compete in today's economic environment.
Please remember that although we have signed an agreement to purchase Temple-Inland, the transaction is still subject to the approval of Temple-Inland's shareholders and customary closing conditions, including antitrust approvals. Until these steps have taken place, and the transaction has been formally closed, International Paper and Temple must operate as separate companies.
As such, there should be no communication of any kind between IP and Temple at this time, beyond the limited group working to finalize the transaction. This policy includes contacts at the corporate level, as well as communication between employees of our mills and plants.
Moving into the future we remain dedicated to providing excellent service and value-added solutions to our customers. Please remember this does not affect day-to-day business operations at International Paper. Safety, customers and continued excellence should remain our top priorities.
We look forward to working with the employees of Temple-Inland as we integrate the businesses and create an even stronger company for our customers, employees and shareholders. We will continue to keep everyone informed of any significant developments as we move toward closing the transaction.
Sincerely,
John Faraci

Dear (Customer Name),
We are pleased to announce an exciting development in International Paper's Business. We have entered into a definitive merger agreement to purchase all outstanding shares of Temple-Inland, subject to normal closing conditions and appropriate regulatory approval.
We believe the combination of International Paper and Temple Inland will make a good existing corrugated packaging business an excellent one, merging two low-cost manufacturing systems and complementary converting systems.
This acquisition is consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow and achieving and sustaining above cost-of-capital returns, and further positions International Paper as your supplier of choice.
Please remember that although we have signed an agreement to purchase Temple-Inland, this transaction is pending normal closing conditions and applicable antitrust approvals by the federal government. Until these steps have taken place, and the transaction has been formally closed, International Paper and Temple-Inland must operate as separate companies.

Thanks, Glenn and as Glenn said, I have got Tim Nicholls and Carol here with me and between the three of us, we will take you through the material here, but then leave time for your questions.
I am just going to start  I think you've all seen the press release. Today, we reached an agreement to acquire Temple for $32 a share. That is a total consideration of $4.3 billion, including approximately $600 million of Temple's debt.
This is what we said at the outset. This is a compelling strategic transaction for International Paper, but it is also one that meets our financial criteria. It is consistent with International Paper's focus on paper and packaging and achieving and sustaining cost of capital returns in a tough business. This makes a good corrugated box business, which we have in International Paper, an excellent one. The strategic logic is  industrial logic is compelling and we have a shared focus on low-cost facilities, complementary converting systems and a high level of box integration. And we see this, when we put Temple together with International Paper, along with the synergies, which we will talk about, a very powerful cash flow engine to help make International Paper better and stronger.
There are significant synergies. We will talk to those. It is accretive in year one and that includes the one-time costs of merging the two companies and it is highly accretive over time. And I think International Paper has demonstrated that we have a good track record of success in integrating companies like Temple, most recently the Weyerhaeuser corrugated packaging business.
Temple-Inland at a glance on page 7, $4 billion in revenue, 2011 First Call EBITDA of approximately $450 million, seven facilities, containerboard mills, 59 box plants and also a building products business. But as you can see, 82% of Temple-Inland is corrugated packaging and that is really what is interesting to International Paper from a strategic standpoint.
The transaction highlights  it is an all-cash deal. The synergies we believe are in the $300 million range. We believe we can achieve those quite quickly and be at that run rate within 24 months. Timing on closing, we would expect to close early in the first quarter of 2012. Obviously, that is subject to a shareowner vote, which we think we will get in that period time and regulatory approval, as well as other customary approvals.
We have committed financing from a UBS-led bank syndicate. The purchase price of $4.3 billion is a 7.4 multiple without synergies and we think an attractive 4.9 multiple with synergies and that is looking at First Call for Temple on 2012 EBITDA.
The financing overview  we are going to put $1.5 billion in cash into the transaction. We will roll over $600 million of Temple debt and put new debt in place of $2.2 billion and we believe and are highly confident that as we look at this, there will be a rapid repayment of that debt and our debt to EBITDA will remain in the 3 times range or less going forward.
Page 11 I think is where we start to see why this is such a compelling strategic acquisition. It is also financially attractive and just looking at the combination of International Paper and Temple together, a $30 billion company in revenues. Again, this isn't about bigger is better; it is about making stronger, better, more competitive International Paper businesses. The $4.5 billion of EBITDA, this is the company level, EBITDA margins of close to 15% and free cash flow of close to $2.2 billion.

RANSCRIPT
 
Kind of peeling back one level, so you can see what does this do to the industrial packaging business because that is obviously the engine that is making all this happen. On the left-hand side, our current corrugated packaging business is about $9 million, $1.5 billion of EBITDA, 17% EBITDA margins, 10 million tons of capacity. Temple substantially increases the size of that business, the scale of that business to where it is, over on the far right, $12 billion of revenues, EBITDA with synergies, a full run rate of over $2.2 billion, improving margins, very important. We get a margin expansion out of this to 19%.
The external environment  there should be no surprises here. It feels to us, in looking at North America, that GDP is struggling to show some positive numbers. Box demand is basically flat. That is consistent with a 0% to 1% GDP growth environment. We wish it was better, but the reality is that is what it is right now.
If we look at the forecast, we expect box demand to improve consistent with the economy over time, but at these sluggish rates, and if we continue with this kind of rate, we will be back to prerecession levels of box demand by 2015, which you see on the next page, is page 14.
I would say the global containerboard markets are strong and we expect them to continue to grow. International Paper remains committed to having a multichannel strategy and access to market, which you have heard Carol talk about.
Moving on to page 15, there are significant synergies here. There are considerable supply chain synergies. We found that with Weyerhaeuser, lots of logistics optimization. We have lots of miles of containerboard traveling to mills and then boxes traveling from box plants to customers. We will re-sort all that and that will be one of the big synergy buckets.
There will be some great mix optimization and efficiency improvements across the mills. We found that out with Weyerhaeuser. We'll find that out again. We will be able to further take a run at putting the right products in the right mills and on the right machines and running those for longer periods of time.
There will be some duplication elimination around SG&A. There will also be an IT integration. We have gotten very good at that, know how to do it. Our corrugated packaging business is on one IT platform. So now we have got Weyerhaeuser and the IP mills on one. So moving Temple onto our system will take some time, but we know how to do that. We will get benefits from that. And then we will be looking at box plants to eliminate duplication where there is some, but also segmenting the customers and the segments to make sure we are serving the customers in the way they expect.
So I am on page 16 now. Just looking at the acquisition assessment and we certainly believe this creates shareowner value. It is very consistent with our focused global paper and packaging strategy. We always said that, in North America, those investments will be around consolidation, as Weyerhaeuser was and this is. It improves the competitive position of one of our core businesses, which is industrial packaging. Earns cost of capital returns, significant synergies, good cash flow generation. We see it having low integration risk.
One of our objectives of a friendly negotiated transaction was to be able to work with Temple at the appropriate time on integration and this enables us to start that process. And we have completed the sufficient due diligence on both Bogalusa and guaranty bank issues that we are comfortable that we know what those are. And it made accommodations for those in our valuation.
So the path forward is to attain regulatory approval, obtain Temple-Inland shareowner approval, which we have to do since we converted this from a tender offer to a merger, develop our integration plan and get focused on day one, but remain focused in the meantime on running International Paper through this uncertain and challenging time.
So just summing up, and then we will turn it over to questions for the three of us. This strengthens IP's portfolio, which I said at the outset, it makes a good industrial packaging business, which got much better with Weyerhaeuser and became a very good one. It gives us the opportunity to make it an excellent one, significant synergy opportunities and we are going to create some meaningful shareowner value out of this for our share owners. So Glenn, if you want to .

QUESTION AND ANSWER
 
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Anthony Pettinari.
 
 
Anthony Pettinari -
Citi - Analyst
Good morning. Since you announced your original bid, Temple has obviously had the Bogalusa and guaranty issues and you referenced due diligence. Can you tell us a little bit more about the due diligence activities? And with regards to accommodations for the valuation, can you give any detail there?
 
 
John Faraci -
International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
Well, what I can say, Anthony, is we had a team in Austin over the weekend. Temple had a dataroom that was populated with quite a bit of information around Bogalusa. They made all the people available that we asked to talk about that and we came to the conclusion, as I think Temple already had, that this was a contained issue. It was one that was unfortunate and both International Paper and Temple [wished that happened did]. Temple has a corrective action plan for Bogalusa, which we have looked at. They are operating under a consent order and we are comfortable that the financial implications and commercial operational implications of Bogalusa going forward are really not significant in the context of this deal.
As far as the bank goes, we are not banking experts, so we didn't try to make ourselves into subject matter experts, but we charged our external legal advisers with going off to meet with Temple's legal advisers to talk about the bank issue. And we think we have appropriately sized that in terms of what the exposure might be.
As you see, Temple has had disclosure all along on the bank issue and feels that it is  the financial exposure is de minimis and we took that, looked at it ourselves, formed our own conclusion and factored that into our valuation.
 
 
Anthony Pettinari -
Citi - Analyst
Okay. And with regards to regulatory approval, you are in a second request period. Do you have a timeframe for that approval and do you anticipate any divestitures?
 
 
John Faraci -
International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
We think by the end of the year, we will be in a position to have reached agreement with the Justice Department on the path forward. And at this point in time, I don't want to speculate on the outcome, but we are highly confident that we are going to get the regulatory approval that we need to proceed on a basis that we think this transaction still makes a whole lot of sense for International Paper and our shareowners.

George Staphos -
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning and best of luck to both companies' employees and shareowners and capital providers. I guess I have two questions generally. One, John, could you parse, if possible, the bucket for synergy in terms of how you would allocate that $300 million? And in a related way, how do you envision the two companies' management teams integrating? Do you have any views on that at this juncture?
 
 
John Faraci -
International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
I would say, George, the synergies are probably going to fall  be similar to [where ours are] in terms of where they fall. Some of the commercial synergies may be a little bit less, but the big buckets are going to be logistics, supply chain, purchasing, overhead, duplication elimination and some box plant rationalization. But this isn't really about requiring Temple not to have fewer facilities; we're acquiring to make both companies better and stronger.
 
 
George Staphos -
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Right.
 
 
John Faraci -
International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
And in terms of management, we will be starting those discussions when it is appropriate to start them with Temple and formulating our own views on the path forward. And it is important to us, as it was with Weyerhaeuser, and I think we demonstrated this. We need the Temple people to help us make this, our industrial packaging business, a better business. And so there will be places for high-performing Temple people in our organization and we are going to welcome them, but we have got some work to do to figure out what the management structure looks like.
 
 
George Staphos -
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Sure. John, one last question and I will turn it over. As we sit here today, and September versus June, you have obviously raised the offer moderately so. But as we look at the environment and how it has changed, obviously, at least from our vantage point, Temple maybe has some liabilities that perhaps we hadn't been or thinking about as regularly as the current time. The economy maybe has gotten a little bit softer versus June. I don't know if you would agree or disagree with that. Could you walk us through what gives you confidence and what the thought process was in actually taking the offer up a little bit further from here given that environment?
Thanks and good luck with the closing.
 
 
John Faraci -
International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
We improved the offer a little less than 5%, roughly $1.50 on where we started. We think that still is a very compelling return as we look at it on what we think are reasonable assumptions. There is no question the economy has slowed. It has not since June since the first part of the year and frankly, I said this to Weyerhaeuser, the more challenging the economy is the more important at the right price. We think this is the right price. Opportunities like Temple or like Weyerhaeuser are because they give us more levers to pull from an efficiency standpoint to expand our margins. So in a way, it sounds a little bit odd, but the tougher the economy gets the more strategic and important opportunities like this are, again, at the right price.
From a risk standpoint, we think Bogalusa is  it is an unfortunate event. As with Temple, we wish it hadn't happened. It did. They have got a corrective action plan. We think they are in the process of putting that in. We have got a good relationship with the state of Louisiana. We look forward to working with them on this going forward, but we think that the Bogalusa, with the plan they have, is behind Temple, not ahead of it and there will be some financial issues, but they are not significant in the scheme of things. We are comfortable with that.
The bank is another issue, but, as I said, we had a due diligence team, not of IP people, but of people who understand issues like this, going over the complaints thoroughly, talking to the Temple legal advisers and we believe Temple has made disclosures about this all along. You know what their view is and we formed a view on our own behalf and factored that into our valuation. So we think we have appropriately and adequately and maybe conservatively covered the bank issue in our $32 offer.

Hi, good morning. Can you give any insight  are there any conditions in the deal or a breakup fee?
 
 
John Faraci

Any what, Gail?
 
 
Gail Glazerman
- UBS - Analyst
Any conditions for the deal in terms of regulatory approval or anything else? And a breakup fee?
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
There is a breakup fee that is part of the merger agreement. And when that gets filed, you will see all that. There are customary closing conditions. We have got to get the Temple shareowners to vote on it. The poison pill obviously needs to be withdrawn as it relates to this transaction. But there are breakup fees both ways.
 
 
Gail Glazerman
- UBS - Analyst
Okay. And I don't know if it is too early if you were just starting due diligence over the weekend, but any thoughts on what incremental CapEx maybe, do you think it can be run at levels that Temple has been spending? I mean the last year has been a bit elevated.
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
We think the capital spending levels are probably, in aggregate, are about right, kind of plus or minus. We will have to see what the mix of spending looks like.

John, as we go back and look at the transformation plan and the logistics and supply chain stuff there, and then at Weyerhaeuser, the original supply chain project got off to a much slower start than you had originally expected. Should we assume that, through that experience and then through Weyerhaeuser, we can  that you are pretty confident that this is going to go much faster and that these synergy numbers are there for probably something we can bank on a little more than we might have back then?

John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
Absolutely. Our supply project across International Paper took three more years than we thought. The supply chain implementation within Weyerhaeuser took a lot shorter period of time. And I will just let Carol comment on that as you see it, Carol.
 
 
Carol Roberts
- International Paper Co. - SVP, Industrial Packaging
Yes, Mark. We have the supply chain system now fully installed inside the Weyerhaeuser facilities going well and we will have the ability to move forward quickly on this. The other thing that helps us is the rest of the company is done now, so we don't have any competing resource issues or priorities. So I feel very confident that we can do this and will do it well.
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
It is amazing, Mark, the incremental cost to put the same capabilities in the Weyerhaeuser facilities that now are all part of IP was a fraction of what it cost to do the initial industrial packaging mills because we had everything in place, we had to make a few modifications, people had been trained, had to train the trainers, train the people and so it went very quickly and very cost effectively without any significant interruptions to our customer base.
 
 
Mark Connelly
- Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst
Okay. So we should feel pretty good about this $300 million synergy number then.
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
You ought to feel good about the number and you ought to feel good about the timeframe.
 
 
Mark Connelly
- Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst
Right. And just one related question, is there a lot of headcount in this number?
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
We really haven't gotten to the point where we have got a specific headcount number associated with those synergies. We know there will be some duplication and there always is, but the real  our experience with Weyerhaeuser was the real merger benefits come in the mills and in logistics. I mean in International Paper, our freight costs are higher than our labor costs in the corrugated packaging business. So we are going to work on freight miles and logistics and warehouses. And that is not people and jobs; that is just costs that we don't need in the system.

Good morning, John. Just curious if you can expand a little bit more on kind of where we stand with the DOJ and whether the price of this deal could be adjusted depending on kind of what DOJ ultimately rolls here.
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
It is still early days with the Department of Justice. We have got a scheduled plan to be engaging with them over the next several weeks. We are in the document production. We have agreed on when that is going to be completed. DOJ has agreed on when they are going to come back and give us their view and they will be sharing that with us along the way. I don't want to speculate on how that is going to come out. And as I said, in the contract and the merger agreement, there is a breakup fee either way for International Paper or for Temple. But we are comfortable that we understand the transaction. We believe we are highly confident we can do the deal and we are confident that we will work through the regulatory approval in a way that won't impact the fundamental value of the deal to International Paper.
 
 
Mark Wilde

Okay. And a smaller matter with regulatory, but I think both IP and Temple have decent sized box businesses down in Mexico. Do you need to get any kind of approvals down there?
 
 
John Faraci

Yes, we do.
 
 
Mark Wilde
- Deutsche Bank - Analyst
Okay. And then John, Temple has been in the middle of this capital program they call Box Plant Transformation II. Will that process, that capital investment be completed now? Are they going to put that on hold as you kind of wait to put the two companies together?
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
Carol can take that one, Mark.
 
 
Carol Roberts
- International Paper Co. - SVP, Industrial Packaging
Mark, my understanding of that is that obviously 2010 was a big year of investment for Temple-Inland and there is work going on this year. And actually one of the things that is exciting about it is the opportunity we have to take the good work that has been done there and leverage that further into a larger box system. So I think the timing is great. If we are closing our deal at the beginning of 12, we get an opportunity to really leverage off and pick up that momentum.
 
 
Mark Wilde

Okay. So it sounds like that plan will probably pretty much run through to fruition.

John Faraci

We thought we had. No, not at this point in time, Mark. It goes, and I think we said this before, the building product business is not part of International Paper's global paper and packaging strategy. Having said that, it is a business that we need to better understand before we come to any conclusions. And that is  I don't want to speculate how that is going to turn out. We need to evaluate what we have first, but I think we have been very clear that we got out of the building products business. We weren't in gypsum, but we were in some of the other businesses Temple is in and they are tough businesses, but I think Temple is doing a good job managing that tough business in that tough environment.

Yes, I think we would all agree on that. Well, listen, good luck on the transaction.

Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
Good morning and congratulations. I was thinking about the comparison of this acquisition with the Weyerhaeuser one a few years ago. And it seems like that Temple is a bit more forward integrated into boxes than Weyerhaeuser was. Does that mean that you may be able to get more synergies out of the box network in this case than you probably did in the Weyerhaeuser situation?
 
 
Carol Roberts
- International Paper Co. - SVP, Industrial Packaging
Chip, I think that is a fairly logical conclusion. That combined with the Box Plant Transformation work that has been done. It does appear that there should be some very good opportunities out of the box business.
 
 
Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
Got you. And then in terms of just the  you mentioned the overhead. Do you sense that the overhead situation at Temple is as big as it was or opportunity as it was at Weyerhaeuser or maybe a little smaller? My impression was that the Weyerhaeuser business was maybe a little bit top-heavier than Temple's is in terms of just the administration aspects.
 
 
Carol Roberts
- International Paper Co. - SVP, Industrial Packaging
Our going in thinking on Temple-Inland is  our impression is that they run fairly lean, definitely at the business level. You still have the often impact of a corporate overhead structure. So that is the difference between the Weyerhaeuser and Temple-Inland, but our thinking is that the business side is going to be leaner than what we found at Weyerhaeuser. They are smaller and a different structure of a company.
 
 
Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
Okay. And then the last question is, and I think, Tim, if I (multiple speakers)  I'm sorry?

RANSCRIPT
 
 
John Faraci
- International Paper Co. - Chairman & CEO
Chip, remember, with Weyerhaeuser, we bought assets and so some of the functions that were providing services to the corrugated packaging business stayed in Tacoma. They didn't come with the asset purchase we made. Since we are acquiring all of Temple, we are going to get all of Temple, including all the building products business, all the corrugated packaging business, which is almost 85% of the company, plus all the support organizations that run Temple.
 
 
Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
Got you. So it might be true that they were leaner, but then you have these other areas you have to deal with. And then the last question, I think Tim mentioned when you all first announced the bid back in early June, late May that you could borrow money I guess 10 to 30 years at roughly 4% to 5%. If you could sort of update us on how to think about the financing. I know it is in place, but are you in a position just to confirm where you don't have to go to the market to term it out? Is it already in essence termed out through the bank process?
 
 
Timothy Nicholls
- International Paper Co. - SVP & CFO
Well, we have a bridge facility that is available to us and we also have a term loan, a five-year term loan and today, if we were going to the market today, we could probably issue 10-year money at 5% or maybe slightly above 5%; 30 year, a little bit more than 6%. So it has moved around since the time we announced, but it hasn't changed in a material way.
 
 
Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
And again, if you did not want to go to market, you could actually wait up to five years if I heard you right. Is that correct for the full amount that you are borrowing to do the deal?
 
 
Timothy Nicholls
- International Paper Co. - SVP & CFO
Well, no. The bridge has  it is a 12-month bridge. So if you remember the Weyerhaeuser transaction, we went to market ahead of the close and went ahead and issued and never had to really draw on the bridge. So it would be a similar thought process that we go through this time.
 
 
Chip Dillon
- Citi - Analyst
Got you. Thank you.
 
 
Timothy Nicholls
- International Paper Co. - SVP & CFO
What the five-year term does is it allows us to pay down debt quickly as we get into the first year of the combined business.

Timothy Nicholls
- International Paper Co. - SVP & CFO
Just generally speaking, we have assumed dollar for dollar. As you know, in the Weyerhaeuser case, we did better not only in terms of realizing synergies faster and getting more of them, we did better in terms of what we had originally thought the costs would be to achieve those synergies. So it is assumed dollar for dollar and then to the extent we can do better, that is what we are going to try to do.
 
 
Mark Weintraub

Right. And then just lastly  and that presumably is tax deductible, the money spent to achieve the synergies, is that correct?

I think Temple management has done a great job building their company. I think Doyle Simons and Pat Maley have done a good job leading the company.
And I think getting clarity for our shareowners and for Temple shareowners and getting International Paper, while this wasn't a distraction, we can now be 100% planning for running the businesses we have and getting ready for making Temple part of International Paper once we get the regulatory approvals. And I think that is a big plus and we are very happy at this level of financial commitment to get to make Temple part of International Paper because it's got a great return and it is going to create a lot of shareowner value and be highly accretive, all which we have been telling investors are our criteria to allocating capital for things like this.
