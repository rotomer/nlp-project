        (g)   Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
        (h)   Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
        (i)    The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act at or before 5:30 P.M., New York City time, on the second full Business Day after the date
of the Terms Agreement and any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement required in connection with the offering and sale of the Underwritten Securities shall have been filed and become effective no later than 10:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the Terms Agreement.
        If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
        The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 will be delivered at the office of counsel for the Underwriters, Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, prior to 9 A.M. on the Closing Date.
        6.
    .    If the sale of the Underwritten Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9(i) hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will promptly reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Underwritten Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
        (a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein; , that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by

a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (w) the Company had previously furnished copies of the relevant Prospectus to the Representatives, (x) delivery of the Prospectus was required by the Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and (z) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
        (b)   Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.
        (c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 Business Days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or
provided
however
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
        (d)   In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Underwritten Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions in each case set forth on the cover of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter
        (a)   If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite
their names in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Underwritten Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Underwritten Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
        (b)   Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Underwritten Securities hereunder unless all of the Underwritten Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by the Company with the approval of the Representatives). The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.

    .    This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal, Delaware or New York State authorities or there shall have occurred a material disruption in clearance or settlement systems; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Underwritten Securities as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement).

[                        ] As Representatives of the Underwriters c/o [                        ]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[            ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [                        ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [            ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [            ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [            ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                        ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)() under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus." This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [            ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement. The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement."
  
        In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
(a)
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
(b)
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(c)
the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(d)
a copy of the Securities in global form as executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee;
(e)
an executed copy of the Indenture;
(f)
an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture; and
(g)
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                        ] and [                        ], respectively, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
        In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified (i) the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement) and (ii) that the Securities conform to the forms thereof that we have reviewed and will be duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
        Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
1.
The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.
The Company has corporate power to issue the Securities, to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
3.
The execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly executed and delivered by the Company; and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
4.
The execution and delivery of the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, will be the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5.
The statements set forth under the headings "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions, and the statements made in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal income tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities.
6.
The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
7.
The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities will not, (a) require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any federal governmental authority or governmental authority of the State of Delaware or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the Trust Indenture Act (but we express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws), (b) result in a violation of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company, or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal law, General Corporation law of the State of Delaware or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance (but we express no opinion relating to the anti-fraud provisions of the United States federal securities law or any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
8.
No registration of the Company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, is required for the offer and sale of the Securities by the Company in the manner contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus.
        Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Company, they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and on a telephonic confirmation from such Secretary of State. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation law of the State of Delaware, that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation), and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
        The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
        We are furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose except that paragraphs 3 and 4 of this opinion letter may be relied upon by the Trustee in its capacity as such. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

[                        ] As Representatives of the Underwriters c/o [                        ]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[            ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [                        ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [                        ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [                        ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [                        ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                        ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)() under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus." This letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [          ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement. The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement."
  
        Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein (except to the extent expressly set forth in numbered paragraph 5 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith) and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid).
        However, in the course of our acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, your representatives and representatives of your counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, portions of certain of the documents incorporated by reference therein and related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company.
        Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such records and documents as described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a)
The Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, we do not know of any contracts of other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not filed or described as required.
(b)
The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(c)
No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date of the Terms Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d)
No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
        We confirm to you that (based solely upon a telephonic confirmation from a representative of the Commission) that the Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission. To the best of our knowledge, no order directed to any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and remains in effect, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
        We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any
investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the views expressed herein.

[                        ] As Representatives of the Underwriters c/o [                        ]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I, Nicholas J. Camera, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), have served as counsel for the Company in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[            ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [                        ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [                  ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [                  ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [                  ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Terms Agreement, including The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions attached as Annex A thereto, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement". Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                        ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)() under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus." This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(b) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [            ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement. The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
  
        In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have reviewed the following documents:
(a)
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
(b)
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(c)
the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(d)
a copy of the Securities in global form as executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee;
(e)
an executed copy of the Indenture;
(f)
an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture; and
(g)
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                        ] and [                        ], respectively, certified
by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, I have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and I have made such investigations of law, as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
        In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement).
        Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
2.
Each significant subsidiary, as defined in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, ("Subsidiary") of the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so incorporated or qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3.
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity and except as rights to indemnification and contribution under the Underwriting Agreement may be limited under applicable law.
4.
The Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when executed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Underwritten Securities are to be issued.
5.
The Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
6.
The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and the consummation of the transactions or actions contemplated by the Prospectus will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, to the best of my knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary.
7.
I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject other than proceedings fairly summarized in all material respects in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Prospectus.
        Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, I have assumed that each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it.
        The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York, and, where necessary, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware.
        I am furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities. This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
Nicholas J. Camera

provided
that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the immediately following paragraph. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date;
provided
that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
        (f)    The Trustee shall set a record date, which shall not be more than 15 days prior to the date of commencement of solicitation of such action contemplated by this section 1.04(f), for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 5.02, (iii) any direction referred to in Section 5.12, (iv) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 5.07(2), or (v) any waiver of past defaults pursuant to Section 5.13, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If such a record date is fixed pursuant to this paragraph, the relevant action may be taken or given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be holders of Securities of a series for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of such series have authorized or agreed or consented to such action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be computed as of such record date;
provided
that no such action by Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities
of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date and the proposed action by Holders to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.06.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders or the validity of the proceedings to which such notice relates.
        In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

    The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or any Vice President of the Corporation under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
        Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
        At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and make such Securities available for delivery. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Sections 315(a) through (d) of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
        (a)   if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.01, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
        (b)   if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 3.01, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
        (c)   that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
        If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, or in the written opinion of counsel to the Trustee (which
counsel may be an employee of the Trustee) such authentication may not lawfully be made or would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
        Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of the immediately preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution and the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to the second preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
        If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Company Order with respect to the authentication and delivery of such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities of such series in global form that (i) shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by such Security or Securities in global form, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Security or Securities in global form or its nominee, and (iii) shall be made available for delivery by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction.
        Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01 for a Security in global form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if the Depositary is so registered. Each Depositary shall enter into an agreement with the Trustee and the Company governing the respective duties and rights of such Depositary, the Company and the Trustee with regard to Securities issued in global form.
        Unless otherwise provided for in the form of Security, each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
        No Security shall be entitled to any benefits under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.09 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
        SECTION 3.04.
    Temporary Securities.
    Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, temporary Securities of such series which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
        In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing all or a portion of the Outstanding Securities of such series.
        Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
        SECTION 3.05.
    Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
    The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with Section 10.02 in a Place of Payment a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the
"Security Register"
) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of registration of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed
"Security Registrar"
for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
        Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity.
        At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Security in global form) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
        Each Security issued in global form authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such series or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Security issued in global form shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in certificated form in the circumstances described below, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
        If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 3.03, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's selection pursuant to Section 3.01(17) shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities of such series and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of
a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor in certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities of such series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
        The Company may at any time in its sole discretion determine that Securities issued in global form shall no longer be represented by such a Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series of like tenor in certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities of such series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
        If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series may surrender a Security in global form of such series in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in certificated form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
        (i)    to each Person specified by such Depositary a new certified Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Security in global form; and
        (ii)   to such Depositary a new Security in global form of like tenor in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of certificated Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
        Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in certificated form, such Security in global form shall be canceled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
        Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
        All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
        Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
        Unless otherwise provided in the Securities to be transferred or exchanged, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06 or 11.07 not involving any transfer.
        If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of such series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 11.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
        The foregoing provisions relating to registration, transfer and exchange may be modified, supplemented or superseded with respect to any series of Securities by a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto.
        SECTION 3.06.
    Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
    If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
        If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
        In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
        Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
        Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
        The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
        SECTION 3.07.
    Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
    Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
        Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called
"Defaulted Interest"
) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
        (1)   The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment (which shall be not less than 25 days after the receipt by the Trustee of such notice, unless such Trustee shall consent to an earlier date), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
        (2)   The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause (2), such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
        Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
        SECTION 3.08.
    Persons Deemed Owners
.    Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be
overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
        None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest of a Security in global form, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Security in global form, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Security in global form or impair, as between such Depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such Security in global form, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the right of such Depositary (or its nominee) as holder of such Security in global form.
        SECTION 3.09.
    Cancellation
.    All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities shall be held by the Trustee and may be destroyed (and, if so destroyed, certification of their destruction shall be delivered to the Company, unless, by a Company Order, the Company shall direct that canceled Securities be returned to it).
        SECTION 3.10.
    Computation of Interest
.    Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
        SECTION 3.11.
    CUSIP Number
.    The Company in issuing Securities of any series may use a "CUSIP" number, and if so, the Trustee may use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders of such series;
provided
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed on the notice or on the Securities of such series, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP number of any series of Securities.
        SECTION 3.12.
    Wire Transfers
.    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company may make any payment of moneys required to be deposited with the Trustee on account of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities (whether pursuant to optional or mandatory redemption payments, interest payments or otherwise) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Trustee on or before the date and time such moneys are to be paid to the Holders of the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof.
        SECTION 3.13.
    Original Issue Discount
.    The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
        SECTION 4.01.
    Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
.    This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to Securities of a particular series (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities and replacement of such Securities which may have been lost, stolen or mutilated as herein expressly provided for or in the form of Security for such series), when the Trustee, upon Company Request and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such Securities, when
        (1)   either (a) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.08) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (b)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount, in the currency or currencies or currency unit or units in which the Securities of such series are payable, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
        (2)   the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable with respect to the Securities of such series hereunder by the Company; and
        (3)   the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with.
        Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of any series, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.07, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last paragraph of Section 10.08 shall survive.
        SECTION 4.02.
    Application of Trust Money
.    Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.08, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
        Section 5.01.
    Events of Default
.    
"Event of Default,"
wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or to be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
        (1)   the Company defaults in the payment of interest on any Security of that series when such interest becomes due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 days; or
        (2)   the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable at Maturity or on redemption or otherwise; or
        (3)   the Company fails to deposit any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or
        (4)   the Company fails to observe or perform in any material respect any of its other covenants, agreements or warranties in the Securities of that series or this Indenture (other than a covenant, agreement or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than that series), and the failure to observe or perform continues for the period and after the notice specified in the last paragraph of this Section; or
        (5)   an event of default, as defined in any mortgage, indenture, or instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any Indebtedness of the Company (including Securities of another series) (other than the Securities of such series) (whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created or incurred) shall occur and shall result in Indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become due and payable, and such default in payment is not cured or such acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled within 10 days after written notice to the Company from the Trustee or to the Company and to the Trustee from the Holders of at least twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series specifying such event of default and requiring the Company to cure such default in payment or cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled and stating that such notice is a
"Notice of Default"
hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that it shall not be an Event of Default if the principal amount of Indebtedness which is not paid at maturity or the maturity of which is accelerated is equal to or less than $20,000,000;
provided further
that if, prior to a declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of that series or the entry of judgment in favor of the Trustee in a suit pursuant to Section 5.03, such default shall be remedied or cured by the Company or waived by the holders of such Indebtedness, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the Holders of the Securities of that series, and
provided further
, that, subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such default unless written notice of such default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company, by a holder or an agent of a holder of any such Indebtedness, by the trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such default shall have occurred, or by the Holders of at least five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time outstanding; or
        (6)   the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law (A) commences a voluntary case or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law
with respect to itself, (B) consents to the entry of a judgment, decree or order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, (C) consents to or acquiesces in the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, (D) applies for, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of or taking possession by a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, (E) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (F) takes any corporate action in furtherance of or to facilitate, conditionally or otherwise, any of the foregoing; or
        (7)   (i) a court of competent jurisdiction enters a judgment, decree or order for relief in an involuntary case or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law which shall (A) approve as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition in respect of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, (B) appoint a Custodian of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of its property or (C) order the winding-up or liquidation of affairs of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and such judgment, decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (ii) any bankruptcy or insolvency petition or application is filed, or any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced, against the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and such petition, application or proceeding is not dismissed or stayed within 60 days; or (iii) a warrant of attachment is issued against any material portion of the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which is not released within 60 days of service; or
        (8)   any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
        A Default under clause (4) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure the Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a
"Notice of Default."
When a Default under clause (4) above is cured within such 60-day period, it ceases to be a Default.
        SECTION 5.02.
    Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
.    If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (6) or (7) of Section 5.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice in writing to the Company, or the Holders of at least twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series by notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of acceleration (or, if the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) on all the Outstanding Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Outstanding Securities of that series (or specified principal amount) shall become and be immediately due and payable.
        If an Event of Default specified in clause (6) or (7) of Section 5.01 occurs, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on the Outstanding Securities of that series (or specified principal amount) shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of any Security of that series.
        Upon payment of all such principal and interest, all of the Company's obligations under the Securities of that series and (upon payment of the Securities of all series) this Indenture shall terminate, except obligations under Section 6.07.
        At any time after a declaration of acceleration of Maturity with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its
consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of and interest on the Securities of that series that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, (ii) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration have been paid, (iii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (iv) all payments due to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.07 have been made.
        SECTION 5.03.
    Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
.    The Company covenants that if:
        (1)   default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
        (2)   default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of any series at the Maturity thereof, or
        (3)   default is made in the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due by the terms of the Securities of any series, and any such default continues for any period of grace provided with respect to the Securities of such series,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
        If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
        If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to secure any other proper remedy.

        (i)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceedings, and
        (ii)   to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07.
        Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
        SECTION 5.05.

        (5)   no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of Holders of Securities of any series shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all Holders of Securities of the affected series.

    Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
    Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

    Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
    No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

    The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may by written notice to the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default
        (1)   in respect of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series, or
        (2)   in respect of a covenant or other provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
        Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture and the Securities of such series; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
        SECTION 5.14.
    Undertaking for Costs.
    All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than ten percent in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

provided
,
however
, that, except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series.

        (d)   the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and may rely on the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith unless such reliance by the Trustee constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct;

        (i)    the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default of Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture;
        (j)    the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder; and

Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
        SECTION 6.05.

    The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.08 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

Neither the Company nor any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company may serve as Trustee. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
        SECTION 6.10.
    Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
    (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11.
        (b)   The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
        (c)   The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
        (d)   If at any time:
        (1)   the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months; or
        (2)   the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months; or
        (3)   the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
        If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction, for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
        (e)   If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company with respect to such Securities. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
        (f)    The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
        SECTION 6.11.    
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor
.    (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
        (b)   In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such
Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
        (c)   Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
        (d)   No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under the Trust Indenture Act.
        SECTION 6.12.

.    Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided
such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor (by merger, conversion, consolidation or otherwise as permitted hereunder) to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
        SECTION 6.13.    
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company
.    The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated therein.
        SECTION 6.14.    
Appointment of Authenticating Agent
.    At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of, and subject to the direction of, the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.06, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
        Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent,
provided
such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
        An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
        The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation as negotiated between the Company and such Authenticating Agent for its services under this Section.
        If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
Dated:                    
        This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
        SECTION 6.15.    
Compliance with Tax Laws
.    The Trustee hereby agrees to comply with all U.S. Federal income tax information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it with respect to payments of premium (if any) and interest on the Securities of any series, whether acting as Trustee, Security Registrar, Paying Agent or otherwise with respect to the Securities of any series.
        Section 7.01.    
Company to Furnish Trustee Names and Addresses of Holders
.    The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:
        (a)   semi-annually, not later than 15 days after the Regular Record Date for each series of Securities, a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities as of such Regular Record Date (unless the Trustee has such information), or if there is no Regular Record Date for interest for such series of Securities, semi-annually, upon such dates as are set forth in the Board Resolution or indenture supplemental hereto authorizing such series, and
        (b)   at such other times as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished;
provided
,
however
, that so long as the Trustee is the Security Registrar, no such list shall be required to be furnished.
        SECTION 7.02.    
Preservation of Information; Communications to Holders
.    (a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 7.01 and the names and addresses of Holders received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 7.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
        (b)   If three or more Holders (herein referred to as
"applicants"
) apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either
        (i)    afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a); or
        (ii)   inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
        If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a) a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interest of the Holders or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all objections so sustained have
been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
        (c)   Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with Section 7.02(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section 7.02(b).
        SECTION 7.03.    
Reports by Trustee
.    (a) Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with the year 2004, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities as provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, a brief report dated as of May 15, if required by and in compliance with Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Trustee shall also comply with Section 313(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
        (b)   A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which any Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on any stock exchange.
        SECTION 7.04.    
Reports by Company
.    The Company shall:
        (1)   file with the Trustee, within 15 days after the Company files the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of said Sections, then it shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations;
        (2)   file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and

For purposes of this paragraph, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture. Such certificate need not comply with Section 1.02.
        Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
        Section 8.01.

provided
,
however
, that (a) the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise or the corporate existence of any of its Subsidiaries if the Board of Directors, or the board of directors of the Subsidiary concerned, as the case may be, shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (b) nothing herein contained shall prevent any Subsidiary of the Company from liquidating or dissolving, or merging into, or consolidating with the Company (
provided
that the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation) or with any one or more other Subsidiaries if the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the Subsidiary concerned, as the case may be, shall so determine.

provided
,
however
, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate provision has been made.

provided
,
however
, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties, or disposing of any of them, if such discontinuance or disposal is, in the judgment of the Board of Directors or of the board of directors of the Subsidiary concerned, as the case may be, desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
        SECTION 10.06.    
Compliance Certificates
.    (a) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (which fiscal year currently ends on December 31), an Officers' Certificate stating whether or not the signer knows of any Default or Event of Default by the Company that occurred prior to the end of the fiscal year and is then continuing.

        (b)   The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 10 days after the occurrence thereof, notice of any acceleration which with the giving of notice and the lapse of time would be an Event of Default within the meaning of Section 5.01(5) hereof.

Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
.    The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim, and will actively resist any and all efforts to be compelled to take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law, which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of and/or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
        SECTION 10.08.    
Money for Securities Payments to be Held in Trust
.    If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
        Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to 10:00 a.m. at each Place of Payment on each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure to so act.
        The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities (other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
        (1)   hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
        (2)   give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series; and
        (3)   at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
        The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
        Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for one year after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided

        SECTION 10.09.    
Limitations on Liens
.    Unless the terms of a particular series of Securities otherwise provide, so long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee any Indebtedness secured by a mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien, charge or other encumbrance (mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens, charges and other encumbrances being hereinafter in this Article 10 referred to as
"lien"
or
"liens"
) upon any assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether such assets are now existing or owned or hereafter created or acquired) without in any such case effectively providing concurrently with the issuance, incurrence, creation, assumption or guaranty of any such Indebtedness that the Securities of such series (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of or guarantee by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities of such series and then existing or thereafter created)
shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the Company's option, prior to) such secured Indebtedness until such time as such Indebtedness is no longer secured by a lien. The preceding sentence shall not require the Company to secure any Securities of such series if the lien consists of either of the following:
        (a)   Permitted Liens; or
        (b)   liens securing Indebtedness if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence, creation, assumption or guaranty of such Indebtedness (and the receipt and application of the proceeds thereof) or the securing of outstanding Indebtedness, the sum of (without duplication) (i) the aggregate principal amount of all such Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon the assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or, if less, the fair market value of the property subject to such lien, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and (ii) all Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions not otherwise permitted under the first sentence of Section 10.11, at the time of determination does not exceed fifteen percent of Consolidated Net Worth.
        SECTION 10.10.    
Limitations on Sale and Lease-back Transactions
.    Unless the terms of a particular series of Securities otherwise provide, so long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction for a term of more than three years unless (a) the assets subject to the Sale and Lease-back Transaction have not been owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or have not been in full operation for more than one year prior to the Sale and Lease-back Transaction or (b) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a lien on such assets in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction without equally and ratably securing the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 10.10 or (c) the Company, within 180 days after the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, applies an amount equal to the value of such assets to the defeasance or retirement (other than any mandatory retirement, mandatory prepayment or sinking fund payment or by way of payment at maturity) of Securities or other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that matures more than one year after the creation of such Indebtedness or to the purchase, construction or development of other comparable property or (d) the transaction is between the Company and one of its Restricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be allowed to enter into Sale and Lease-back Transactions if, after giving pro forma effect to such Sale and Lease-back Transaction (and the receipt and application of proceeds thereof) the sum of (without duplication) (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries secured by liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon the assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or, if less, the fair market value of the property subject to such lien, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and (ii) all Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions not otherwise permitted under the first sentence of this Section 10.11, at the time of determination does not exceed fifteen percent of Consolidated Net Worth.
        SECTION 10.11.    
Waiver of Certain Covenants
.    The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.09 or 10.10 with respect to the Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act or such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
        SECTION 11.01.    
Applicability of Article
.    Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
        SECTION 11.02.    
Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee
.    The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
        SECTION 11.03.    
Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed
.    If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not less than 90 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, substantially pro rata, by lot or by any other method as the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and that complies with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such Securities are listed, and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series;
provided
that in case the Securities of such series have different terms and maturities, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Company and the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee.
        The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
        For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of the Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
        SECTION 11.04.    
Notice of Redemption
.    Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register.
        All notices of redemption shall state:
        (1)   the Redemption Date;
        (2)   the Redemption Price;
        (3)   if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
        (4)   that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
        (5)   the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
        (6)   that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
        (7)   the CUSIP number, if any, of the Securities to be redeemed.
        Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request made at least five Business Days prior to the date upon which such notice is to be mailed, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
        SECTION 11.05.    
Deposit of Redemption Price
.    Prior to 10:00 a.m. at each Place of Payment on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.08) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
        Unless any Security by its terms prohibits any sinking fund payment obligation from being satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities (including Securities redeemed otherwise than through a sinking fund), the Company may deliver such Securities to the Trustee for crediting against such payment obligation in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
        SECTION 11.06.    
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
.    Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date;
provided
,
however
, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular or Special Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07.
        If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
        SECTION 11.07.    
Securities Redeemed in Part
.    Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency of the Company at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and Stated Maturity, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
        SECTION 12.01.    
Applicability of Article
.    The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
        The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a
"mandatory sinking fund payment,"
and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an
"optional sinking fund payment."
If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
        SECTION 12.02.    
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
.    The Company (1) may deliver Securities of a series (other than any Securities previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series;
provided
that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
        SECTION 12.03.    
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
.    Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered (which have not been previously delivered). Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.06 and 11.07.
        SECTION 13.01.    
Applicability of Article; Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
.    Unless pursuant to Section 3.01 provision is made for the inapplicability of either or both of (a) defeasance of the Securities of a series under Section 13.02 or (b) covenant defeasance of the Securities of a series under Section 13.03, then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the other provisions of this Article, shall be applicable to the Securities of such series, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to the Securities of such series, elect to have either Section 13.02 (unless inapplicable) or Section 13.03 (unless inapplicable) be applied to the Outstanding Securities of such series upon compliance with the applicable conditions set forth below in this Article.
        SECTION 13.02.    
Defeasance and Discharge
.    Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 13.01 to defease the Outstanding Securities of a particular series, the Company shall be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on the date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 13.04 are satisfied (hereinafter,
"defeasance"
). Defeasance shall mean that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the
Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same);
provided
,
however
, that the following rights, obligations, powers, trusts, duties and immunities shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund provided for in Section 13.04, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 6.07, 10.02 and 10.08, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article.

        SECTION 13.03.    
Covenant Defeasance
.    Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 13.01 to obtain a covenant defeasance with respect to the Outstanding Securities of a particular series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under this Indenture (except its obligations under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 5.06, 5.09, 6.07, 6.10, 10.01, 10.02, 10.06, 10.07 and 10.08) with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on and after the date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 13.04 are satisfied (hereinafter,
"covenant defeasance"
). Covenant defeasance shall mean that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in this Indenture (except its obligations under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 5.06, 5.09, 6.07, 6.10, 10.01, 10.02, 10.06, 10.07 and 10.08), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein or by reason of any reference to any other provision herein or in any other document, and such omission to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5.01(4) with respect to Outstanding Securities of such series, and the remainder of this Indenture and of the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.
        SECTION 13.04.

(it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).
        (3)   Such deposit, defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

"Trustee"
) pursuant to Section 13.04 in respect of the Outstanding Securities of a particular series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
        The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 13.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof, other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series.
        Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 13.04 with respect to Securities of any series which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited for the purpose for which such money or Government Obligations were deposited.

provided
,
however
, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations, as the case may be, so held in trust.
