(f)            The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for sale by the Underwriters under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the sale of the Underwritten Securities; that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Underwritten Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.  The Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

The Company will cooperate with the Representatives and use its best efforts to permit the Underwritten Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.
(h)          
During the period beginning on the Execution Time and continuing to and including the respective Closing Date, the Company shall not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company or warrants to purchase debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Underwritten Securities (other than (i) the Underwritten Securities and (ii) commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business), without the prior written consent of the Underwriters.
(i)           
(j)            The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or which has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Underwritten Securities.

(l)            The Company will apply the proceeds from the sale of the Underwritten Securities in the manner described in the Prospectus.
(m)          Prior to the completion of the distribution of the Underwritten Securities, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives of any material development relating to any investigation of the Company conducted by the Commission, including the discovery of any new or additional information that in the opinion of the Company may reasonably be expected to affect the outcome of such investigation.
5.             .  The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein at the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters
(a)           The Company shall have requested and caused Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, counsel for the Company, to furnish to the Representatives its opinion and letter, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially to the effect set forth in Exhibit A1.
(b)           The Company shall have requested and caused Nicholas J. Camera, Esq., the General Counsel of the Company, to furnish to the Representatives his opinion and letter, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially to the effect set forth in Exhibit A2.
(c)           The Representatives shall have received from Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to certain of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Exhibit A-1, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon such matters.
In addition, such counsel shall state that (A) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, and the Prospectus, as of its date, appear on their faces to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (B) such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the documents incorporated by reference) were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, on the basis of the foregoing, no fact has come to the attention of such counsel that gave such counsel reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Prospectus, as of its date and the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or
omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(d)           The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the chief financial officer of the Company and the treasurer or the controller of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, the Terms Agreement and this Agreement and that:
(i)            the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and the Terms Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date; and
(ii)           since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement).
(e)           The Underwriters shall have received on (i) the date of the Terms Agreement, and (ii) the Closing Date, a letter, dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, independent public accountants, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each such letter shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than three days prior to the date of such letter.
(f)            Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement), there shall not have been (i) any change in the capital stock, any increase in long-term debt (excluding the Underwritten Securities) or any decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or stockholders' equity, or any decreases in total consolidated net sales, income from operations or net income, of the Company with respect to the period subsequent to the end of the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter, other than as set forth in the letter referred to in Section 5(e) hereof; or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except
as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date of the Terms Agreement).
(g)           Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(h)           Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act at or before 5:30 P.M., New York City time, on the second full Business Day after the date of the Terms Agreement and any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement required in connection with the offering and sale of the Underwritten Securities shall have been filed and become effective no later than 10:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the Terms Agreement.
(i)           
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 will be delivered at the office of counsel for the Underwriters, Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, prior to 9 A.M. on the Closing Date.
6.             .  If the sale of the Underwritten Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9(i) hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will promptly reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Underwritten Securities.
Reimbursement of Expenses

Indemnification and Contribution
(a)           The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein; , that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (w) the Company had previously furnished copies of the relevant Prospectus to the Representatives, (x) delivery of the Prospectus was required by the Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and (z) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
provided further
(b)           Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically
 
for inclusion in the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 Business Days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be
provided
however
sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d)           In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Underwritten Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions in each case set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter
(a)           If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Underwritten Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Underwritten Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
(b)           Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Underwritten Securities hereunder unless all of the Underwritten Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by the Company with the approval of the Representatives).  The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.
9.             .  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal, Delaware or New York State authorities or there shall have occurred a material disruption in clearance or settlement systems; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or

(g)
                                
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                 ] and [                 ], respectively, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.  In addition, we have assumed and have not verified (i) the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement) and (ii) that the Securities conform to the forms thereof that we have reviewed and will be duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
 
1.             The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.             The Company has corporate power to issue the Securities, to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
3.            
The execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly executed and delivered by the Company; and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
 
4.            
The execution and delivery of the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, will be the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5.            
The statements set forth under the headings "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions, and the statements made in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal income tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities.
6.             The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
7.             The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture
, the Supplemental Indenture
and the Securities will not, (a) require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any federal governmental authority or governmental authority of the State of Delaware or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be  applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Trust Indenture Act (but we express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws), (b) result in a violation of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company, or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal law, General Corporation law of the State of Delaware or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance (but we express no opinion relating to the anti-fraud provisions of the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
8.             No registration of the Company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, is required for the offer and sale of the Securities by the Company in the manner contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus.
                                Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Company, they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and on a telephonic confirmation from such Secretary of State.  Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other
party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation), and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
 
                                The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
                We are furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose except that paragraphs 3 and 4 of this opinion letter may be relied upon by the Trustee in its capacity as such.  We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

As Representatives of the Underwriters c/o [                               ]
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[              ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [      ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [      ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.  Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(_) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus."  This letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [           ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.  The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein (except to the extent expressly set forth in numbered paragraph 5 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith), and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid).
However, in the course of our acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, your representatives and representatives of your counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus, portions of certain of the documents incorporated by reference therein and related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company.
Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such records and documents as described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a)           The Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  In addition, we do not know of any contracts of other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not filed or described as required.
(b)           The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(c)           No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date of the Terms Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d)           No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We confirm to you that (based solely upon a telephonic confirmation from a representative of the Commission) that the Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.  To the best of our knowledge, no order directed to any documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and remains in effect, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.  We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the views expressed herein.

As Representatives of the Underwriters c/o [                                       ]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I, Nicholas J. Camera, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), have served as counsel for the Company in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[              ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [      ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [      ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.  Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(_) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus."  This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(b) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [           ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.  The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have reviewed the following documents:
(a)
                                 
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
(b)
                                
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(c)
                                 
the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(d)
                                
a copy of the Securities in global form as executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee;
(e)
                                 
an executed copy of the Indenture;
(f)
                                   
an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture; and
(g)
                                
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                    ] and [                    ], respectively, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, I have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and I have made such investigations of law, as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.  In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement).
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
              
The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
2.
              
Each significant subsidiary, as defined in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, ("Subsidiary") of the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so incorporated or qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3.
              
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity and except as rights to indemnification and contribution under the Underwriting Agreement may be limited under applicable law.
4.
              
The Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when executed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued.
5.
              
The Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
6.
              
The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and the consummation of the transactions or actions contemplated by the Prospectus will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, to the best of my knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary.
7.
              
I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject other than proceedings fairly summarized in all material respects in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Prospectus.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, I have assumed that each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York, and, where necessary, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware.
I am furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
Nicholas J. Camera

The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 Business Days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be
provided
however
sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d)           In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Underwritten Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions in each case set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Default by an Underwriter
(a)           If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Underwritten Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Underwritten Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

(b)           Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Underwritten Securities hereunder unless all of the Underwritten Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by the Company with the approval of the Representatives).  The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.

This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal, Delaware or New York State authorities or there shall have occurred a material disruption in clearance or settlement systems; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[              ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [      ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [      ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.  Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(_) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus."  This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [           ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.  The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
(a)
                                 
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
(b)
                                
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(c)
                                 
the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(d)
                                
a copy of the Securities in global form as executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee;
(e)
                                 
an executed copy of the Indenture;
(f)
                                   
an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture; and
(g)
                                
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                 ] and [                 ], respectively, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.  In addition, we have assumed and have not verified (i) the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement) and (ii) that the Securities conform to the forms thereof that we have reviewed and will be duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
 
1.             The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.             The Company has corporate power to issue the Securities, to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
3.            
The execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have each been duly executed and delivered by the Company; and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
 
4.            
The execution and delivery of the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, will be the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5.            
The statements set forth under the headings "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions, and the statements made in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal income tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities.
6.             The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
7.             The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture
, the Supplemental Indenture
and the Securities will not, (a) require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any federal governmental authority or governmental authority of the State of Delaware or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be  applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Trust Indenture Act (but we express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws), (b) result in a violation of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company, or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal law, General Corporation law of the State of Delaware or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance (but we express no opinion relating to the anti-fraud provisions of the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
8.             No registration of the Company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, is required for the offer and sale of the Securities by the Company in the manner contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus.
                                Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Company, they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and on a telephonic confirmation from such Secretary of State.  Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other
party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation), and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
 
                                The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
                We are furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose except that paragraphs 3 and 4 of this opinion letter may be relied upon by the Trustee in its capacity as such.  We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[              ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [      ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [      ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.  Such registration statement, as amended when it became effective but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated November 20, 2003, as first filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the prospectus supplement dated [                ], as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(_) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Prospectus Supplement;" and the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Prospectus."  This letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.Debt SecuritiesUnderwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Basic Provisions") attached as Annex A to the Terms Agreement dated [           ] (the "Terms Agreement") between the Company and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") listed in Schedule I to the Terms Agreement.  The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein (except to the extent expressly set forth in numbered paragraph 5 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith), and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid).
However, in the course of our acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, your representatives and representatives of your counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus, portions of certain of the documents incorporated by reference therein and related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company.
Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such records and documents as described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a)           The Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  In addition, we do not know of any contracts of other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not filed or described as required.
(b)           The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(c)           No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date of the Terms Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d)           No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We confirm to you that (based solely upon a telephonic confirmation from a representative of the Commission) that the Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.  To the best of our knowledge, no order directed to any documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and remains in effect, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.  We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the views expressed herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I, Nicholas J. Camera, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), have served as counsel for the Company in connection with the Company's issuance and sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-109384) of $[              ] principal amount of its [    ]% Senior Notes due [      ] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and [      ] as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of [      ], 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.

The Terms Agreement, including the Basic Provisions, is herein referred to as the "Underwriting Agreement".
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have reviewed the following documents:
(a)
                                 
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
(b)
                                
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(c)
                                 
the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(d)
                                
a copy of the Securities in global form as executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee;
(e)
                                 
an executed copy of the Indenture;
(f)
                                   
        an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture; and
(g)
                                
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended through [                    ] and [                    ], respectively, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
In addition, I have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and I have made such investigations of law, as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.  In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement).
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
              
The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
2.
              
Each significant subsidiary, as defined in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, ("Subsidiary") of the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so incorporated or qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3.
              
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity and except as rights to indemnification and contribution under the Underwriting Agreement may be limited under applicable law.
4.
              
The Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when executed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued.
5.
              
The Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and the Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of, the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
6.
              
The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and the consummation of the transactions or actions contemplated by the Prospectus will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, each as amended, of the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, to the best of my knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary.
7.
              
I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject other than proceedings fairly summarized in all material respects in the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Securities, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Prospectus.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, I have assumed that each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York, and, where necessary, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware.
I am furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
Nicholas J. Camera
