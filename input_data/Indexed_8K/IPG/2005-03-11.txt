FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York, NY (March 11, 2005)  Interpublic indicated today that it would require additional time to file its annual report on Form 10-K and to release fourth quarter and full year 2004 earnings. The company has previously disclosed that it has a number of material weaknesses in internal control, including the documentation and control of the financial results reporting process. The delay will extend past March 31, the latest due date for filing the Form 10-K. The company attributed the delay to the breadth of internal work and analysis required given its material control weaknesses and in order to complete management's report on internal controls, as required by section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
     The company has recently identified items that may require adjustments to prior period financial statements. Currently, the most significant of these items concerns acquisitions during the period from 1996 through 2001, for which the company may have improperly consolidated the results of acquired companies. The company is in the early stages of its review, but has identified preliminary amounts of approximately $145 million in revenue and $25 million of net income that may have been improperly recognized from 1996 through 2001. This review also encompasses several other matters that may also require adjustment to prior period financial statements, but the company has not yet determined the amounts and periods affected.
     "Since assuming my new role, I have been clear that the control environment is our most immediate priority," said Interpublic Chairman and CEO, Michael Roth. "The extensive review process we have undertaken is appropriate given the material control weaknesses we face. We were unable to provide details concerning the timing of our earnings release until having come to this point in our process. We regret this, as well as the delay to our filing that will result. But the actions we are taking are consistent
with our stated desire to thoroughly address internal controls and move beyond our financial reporting issues. These actions are not related to and should not impede the professional performance of our operating units, many of which continue to make great strides and deliver outstanding work and results to their clients."
     The company intends to seek waivers and amendments of its covenants and indentures from its bank syndicate and its bondholders. On March 17, the company will update timing and status for both its 10-K filing and earnings release.
