FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York, NY (March 29, 2005)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) (the "Company") today announced developments in its solicitation of consents to proposed amendments relating to the following series of debt securities (the "Securities"):
The proposed amendments provide, pursuant to the terms of the Company's consent solicitation dated March 18, 2005, that failure to comply with certain reporting covenants will not constitute a default under the indentures.
For the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2005, the 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 and the 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014, the Company announced that Supplemental Indentures with respect to each such series have been executed and the Effective Time was 9:00 p.m. on March 28, 2005. Consents delivered to the Company by record holders of Securities of these Series are irrevocable unless the Company fails to pay such holders pursuant to the terms of the solicitation. The Company's acceptance of consents for these Series is, however, conditioned on receipt of the requisite consents for all Series subject to the solicitation, subject to the Company's right to waive this condition.

The Company also extended the expiration date for the consent solicitation, which was March 28, 2005, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 29, 2005, unless extended by the Company with respect to any series. Record holders may provide their consents to the Company at any time before the expiration date with respect to the series of securities they hold.
The solicitation is subject to certain conditions and presents certain risks for holders who consent, as set forth more fully in the consent solicitation statement and related consent form. These documents contain important information, and holders should read them carefully before making any decision.
The Company has retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC to serve as solicitation agents for the solicitation, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the information agent.
Copies of the solicitation statement and related consent form may be obtained at no charge by contacting the information agent by telephone at (866) 470-3900 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774, or in writing at 65 Broadway - Suite 704, New York, NY 10006.
