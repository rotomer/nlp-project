FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York, NY (March 30, 2005)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) (the "Company") today announced further developments in its solicitation of consents to proposed amendments relating to the following series of debt securities (the "Securities"):
The proposed amendments provide, pursuant to the terms of the Company's consent solicitation dated March 18, 2005, that failure to comply with certain reporting covenants will not constitute a default under the indentures.
The Company announced that a Supplemental Indenture with respect to the 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 has been executed and that the Effective Time for that Series was 9:00 p.m. on March 29, 2005. The Company had previously announced the execution of Supplemental Indentures with respect to the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2005, 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 and 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014. Consents delivered to the Company by record holders of Securities of these four series are irrevocable unless the Company fails to pay such holders pursuant to the terms of the solicitation. The Company's acceptance of consents for these series is, however, conditioned

on receipt of the requisite consents for all series subject to the solicitation, subject to the Company's right to waive this condition.
Concerning the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Convertible Notes"), the Company announced that it is amending the terms of the consent solicitation and expects to receive additional consents sufficient to attain the requisite majority. Upon receipt of the requisite consents, the supplemental indenture for the Convertible Notes will include, in addition to the proposed amendments previously described: (1) an extension from March 15, 2008 to September 15, 2009 of the date before which the Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes and (2) an additional "make-whole" adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions, which is an element of event risk protection that has become more common in the convertible bond market since the Convertible Notes were issued. The amendment is fully described in a supplement dated today to the consent solicitation dated March 18, 2005, copies of which are available from the Company or from the Solicitation Agents or the Information Agent for the Solicitation.
Finally, the Company also extended the expiration date for the consent solicitation, which was March 29, 2005, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 31, 2005, unless extended by the Company with respect to any series. Record holders may provide their consents to the Company at any time before the expiration date with respect to the series of securities they hold.
The solicitation is subject to certain conditions and presents certain risks for holders who consent, as set forth more fully in the consent solicitation statement, as supplemented, and related consent form. These documents contain important information, and holders should read them carefully before making any decision.
The Company has retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC to serve as solicitation agents for the solicitation, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the information agent.
Copies of the solicitation statement and related consent form may be obtained at no charge by contacting the information agent by telephone at (866) 470-3900 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774, or in writing at 65 Broadway - Suite 704, New York, NY 10006.
 
Interpublic Group 1114 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036 212-704-1200 tel 212-704-1201 fax

In any jurisdiction where the laws require solicitations to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the solicitation will be deemed to be made on behalf of the Company by the solicitation agents, or one or more registered broker dealers under the laws of such
jurisdiction.
