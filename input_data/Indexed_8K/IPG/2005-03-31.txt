New York, NY (March 31, 2005)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) (the "Company") today announced that it had successfully obtained the requisite consents to
amendments relating to each of the following series of debt securities (the "Securities"):
The amendments provide, pursuant to the terms of the Company's consent solicitation dated March 18, 2005, that failure to comply with certain reporting covenants will not constitute a default under the indentures. With respect to the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
"Convertible Notes"), the amendments further provide: (1) an extension from March 15, 2008 to September 15, 2009 of the date before which the Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes and (2) an additional "make-whole" adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a
change of control meeting specified conditions, which is an element of event risk protection that has become more common in the convertible bond market since the Convertible Notes were issued.
The Company further announced that a Supplemental Indenture with respect to the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Convertible Notes") has been executed and that the Effective Time for that series was 1:00 p.m. on March 30, 2005. The Company had previously

announced the execution of Supplemental Indentures with respect to each other series of Securities pursuant to the consent solicitation. Consents delivered to the Company by record
holders of Securities of all series are irrevocable unless the Company fails to pay such holders pursuant to the terms of the solicitation.
The expiration date for the consent solicitation for all series of Securities is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 31, 2005, unless extended by the Company with respect to any series. Record holders may provide their consents to the Company at any time before the expiration date with respect to the series of Securities they hold.
The solicitation presents certain risks for holders who consent, as set forth more fully in the
consent solicitation statement, as supplemented, and related consent form. These documents contain important information, and holders should read them carefully before making any decision.
The Company has retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC to serve as solicitation agents for the solicitation, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the information agent.

solicitation is being made solely by the consent solicitation statement and related consent form. In any jurisdiction where the laws require solicitations to be made by a licensed broker or
dealer, the solicitation will be deemed to be made on behalf of the Company by the solicitation agents, or one or more registered broker dealers under the laws of such jurisdiction
