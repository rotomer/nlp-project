Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 22, 2005, The Interpublic Group of Companies ("we" or the "Company") entered into a waiver and an amendment to the $450 million 3-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2004, as amended as of September 29, 2004 and March 31, 2005 (the "Three-Year Credit Agreement") and a waiver and an amendment to the $250 million 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2004, as amended as of September 29, 2004 and March 31, 2005 (the "364-Day Credit Agreement" and, together with the Three-Year Credit Agreement, the "Credit Agreements") (respectively, the "Waivers" and the "Amendments"), each as attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.4.
The Waivers and Amendments primarily extend the relief and related conditions included in the waivers and amendments entered into by the Company on March 31, 2005. The Waivers to the Credit Agreements waive any breach or condition to borrowing related to (i) the Company's inability to provide audited 2004 financial statements and to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004 until September 30, 2005, and (ii) the Company's inability to provide unaudited financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2005 and to file its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ending March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 until September 30, 2005. The Amendments to the Credit Agreements, among other things, (i) require the Company to maintain a daily ending balance of $225,000,000 of cash and securities in domestic accounts with its lenders as a condition to using the facilities, (ii) restrict the Company's ability to make cash acquisitions in excess of $7,500,000 in the aggregate until September 30, 2005, (iii) restrict the Company's ability to make certain restricted payments such as dividends until September 30, 2005 except that the Company may pay dividends on its preferred stock and repurchase capital stock in connection with employees' exercise of options, (iv) restrict the Company's use of borrowings under the Credit Agreements to funding known cash requirements of the Company in the ordinary course of business (excluding any payments of principal on public debt) within fifteen days of such requirements becoming due, and (v) amend financial covenants with respect to the Company's interest coverage ratio, debt to EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA. The Amendment to the 364-Day Credit Agreement also extends the termination date under that agreement from July 11, 2005 to September 30, 2005.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
The Employment Agreement dated October 1, 2003 (filed on March 15, 2004 as Exhibit 10(vii)(a) to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K as amended by a Supplemental Agreement, dated June 30, 2004, filed on August 9, 2004 as Exhibit 10(III)(A)(14) to the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q), between the Company and Robert Thompson, has been terminated pursuant to Mr. Thompson's resignation on June 22, 2005. The termination will take effect 90 days from the date of his resignation. See Item 5.02 of this report which is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Update on Interim Results
We are not yet able to provide preliminary financial information for interim periods in 2005, or any information for the full year 2004 beyond what we provided in our report on Form 8-K dated March 31, 2005 and filed on April 5, 2005 (the "April 5, 2005 Form 8-K"). We continue to gather information from our operating entities and to review it using the intensive manual processes referred to in our previous filings and described under Item 8.01 below. The consolidated financial statements for 2004 and the first and second quarters of 2005 will be prepared after that review is complete.
 
 
 
 
 
 
We are also reviewing a number of items that may require restatement of financial statements for prior periods, as described in the April 5, 2005 Form 8-K and under Item 8.01 below. A particular element of uncertainty relates to the timing of revenue recognition under our customer contracts, which could significantly affect results in a given quarter, and thus affect year-on-year comparisons. We believe that the impact of the timing of revenue recognition on comparisons of full years will likely be less significant.
For all these reasons, we are not able to report results for the first quarter of 2005 with reasonable assurance. It is particularly difficult to analyze how the first quarter of 2005 compared with the first quarter of 2004, since we are still reviewing whether we must restate our previously reported figures for the first quarter of 2004 as well as completing our work on the first quarter of 2005.
Based on preliminary information, however, we currently believe that in the first quarter of 2005 revenue declined moderately compared to the first quarter of 2004, but at this point in our analysis we cannot rule out that this revenue change will increase or decrease. We also believe that our operating margin in the first quarter was adversely affected by higher operating expenses compared to the first quarter of 2004. The increase in operating expenses can be attributed in part to continued increases in professional fees primarily relating to the ongoing work on our financial reporting process, an increase in salary costs and higher incentive costs due to a change in the quarterly attribution of incentive expense accruals, reflecting a revised compensation plan introduced in mid-2004. While this preliminary information will change as we complete our analysis, we currently expect that the apparent decrease in organic revenue and operating margin in the first quarter should be confirmed when we complete our review process.
Update on Liquidity
At March 31, 2005, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents was $1,553.0 million and debt was $2,256.1 million. The following table sets forth our estimated short-term and long-term debt as of March 31, 2005.
 
We have $250,000,000 of our 7 7/8% Senior Unsecured Notes (the "Notes") maturing on October 15, 2005. We could repay these Notes at maturity from cash on hand, but we are considering refinancing them by engaging in one or more financings and redeeming, or otherwise retiring, the Notes. After these Notes mature, the next scheduled maturity of our long-term debt is in 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our ability to draw under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Three-Year Credit Agreement at any time is subject to compliance with all our applicable covenants and obligations under the Credit Agreements, including financial covenants with respect to our interest coverage ratio, debt to EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA. We have amended the financial covenants as they apply to year-end 2004 and the first and second quarters of 2005. We will evaluate compliance with the financial covenants for those periods once we publish annual financial statements for 2004 and quarterly financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2005. Beginning with the third quarter of 2005, the financial covenants revert to the levels previously agreed, and there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants.
We plan to negotiate with lenders so as to be able, by September 30, 2005, to replace the 364-Day Credit Agreement (which will expire on September 30, 2005) with one or more new syndicated credit agreements and to amend or replace the Three-Year Credit Agreement.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
On June 22, 2005, Robert Thompson, our Chief Financial Officer, resigned. Mr. Thompson has agreed to continue acting as Chief Financial Officer until a successor takes office, for up to 90 days. A copy of the June 28, 2005 press release announcing Mr. Thompson's resignation is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 8.01 Other Events
Financial Reporting Update
We have previously disclosed delays in (i) completing our financial statements for 2004, and filing our annual report on Form 10-K for 2004 with the SEC, (ii) distributing to shareholders our 2004 annual report and our 2005 proxy statement, and (iii) completing our financial statements, and filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for the first quarter of 2005. We now expect that we will also be unable to complete our financial statements, and file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for the second quarter of 2005 by the time the quarterly report is due on August 9, 2005. We have previously described these matters in (i) our current report on Form 8-K dated March 17, 2005 (Item 8.01 of which is incorporated by reference herein) and (ii) our April 5, 2005 Form 8-K, Items 1.01 and 8.01 of which are incorporated by reference herein. The April 5, 2005 Form 8-K also describes certain consequences and risks that we face as a result of our difficulties in financial reporting.
We are now planning to be current in our SEC filings and other financial reporting obligations by September 30, 2005. By that date, we plan to file our annual report on Form 10-K for 2004 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2005 and to provide the corresponding financial statements to the lenders under our credit agreements and the trustees under the indentures governing our debt securities. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that we will complete these filings in time to meet this target because extensive work remains to be done.
The delays in financial reporting are attributable to the additional work and analysis required due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the potential need to restate financial statements for prior periods:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because we will not file our annual report on Form 10-K for 2004 by June 30, 2005, we will be required to pay an additional consent fee to some record holders of our public debt. In March 2005, we obtained amendments to the indentures governing five public debt issues, under which there is no default resulting from our delay in reporting for 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005. This relief expires on September 30, 2005. We agreed to pay an additional consent fee of $1.25 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of bonds outstanding to holders of record as of March 9, 2005 who consented to the amendments if we have not filed our annual report on Form 10-K by June 30, 2005.
As we have previously disclosed, there would be serious consequences if we are not current in our financial reporting by September 30, 2005. These include default under the indentures governing our debt securities, which could result in re-classifying our long-term debt as short-term, and potentially in exposure to acceleration and cross-acceleration following a notice of default and a 60-day cure period. These matters are described in more detail in our April 5, 2005 Form 8-K.
If we do not meet our financial reporting obligations by September 30, 2005, we would be unable to meet the conditions precedent to drawing under the Credit Agreements or to the issuance of additional letters of credit under the Three-Year Credit Agreement. The lenders under each Credit Agreement would also have the right to terminate that Credit Agreement and to accelerate any outstanding principal. The lenders under the Three-Year Credit Agreement would also have the right to require us to provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of outstanding letters of credit. The same consequences could also result if a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods results from intentional misstatements that have a material negative impact on our financial condition. At present, we have no outstanding principal amounts under either Credit Agreement, and consistent with our recent practice we do not currently expect to draw under either Credit Agreement. A total of approximately $165 million in letters of credit is outstanding under the Three-Year Credit Agreement, no amount of which has been drawn upon by a beneficiary.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other possible consequences of failing to meet the September 30 filing date might include reduced availability of advances under uncommitted credit lines, which we use for working capital needs in some of our operations outside the United States. This would require us to provide funding directly to some overseas operations. Our credit ratings could also be downgraded. These developments, and the effect on our actual or perceived liquidity and credit standing, could have further adverse effects on our business or our liquidity that we cannot predict.
Internal Control Reporting Update
As we have previously disclosed, when we file our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K, it will include our report on internal control over financial reporting stating that at December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and disclosing the material weaknesses we have identified in our internal control over financial reporting. Management will, however, be unable to determine whether the elements of internal control over financial reporting related directly to preparing the annual financial statements for external purposes, as well as the processes related to income taxes, were operating effectively as of December 31, 2004, as a result of extensive modification of the system in place at year-end which can no longer be observed or assessed.
We continue to expect that our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K will also include a report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on our internal control over financial reporting that will include a disclaimer of opinion. The SEC staff may take the position that, as a result, our annual report does not comply with the requirements of the SEC's rules under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and in that event, the consequences of late filing under the federal securities laws described in the April 5, 2005 Form 8-K may persist until we file an annual report or amended annual report containing an audit report on internal control over financial reporting that does not disclaim an opinion (and, with respect to eligibility to use "short-form" registration, for 12 months thereafter). Also in that event, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") might take the position that we continue to be in violation of its rules requiring that we provide an annual report to the NYSE and to shareholders. Under the publicly announced policy of the NYSE, such a continuing failure would result in the commencement of delisting proceedings nine months after our 2004 Form 10-K was required to be filed, with an additional three-month trading period at the NYSE's discretion.
Status of Potential Restatement Items
As discussed above, our work on the items we have identified that may require adjustments to prior period financial statements has not yet been completed. It is still possible that we will identify new matters that may require restatement, and we still expect new information to come to light. Accordingly, any matters that we identify at this stage, and any assessments of the nature, scope or amount of restatements, are necessarily preliminary and subject to change. We still expect to conclude that restatements of prior period financial statements are required, although we still have not yet concluded that the effects on those period are so material that our financial statements for those periods can no longer be relied upon.
As we have previously disclosed, we are the subject of an SEC enforcement investigation, which remains unresolved. The scope of the investigation, including subpoenas requesting documents, has expanded to cover the potential restatement items identified in the April 5, 2005 Form 8-K.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cautionary Statement

If at any time the Agent reasonably determines that any funds held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account are subject to any right or interest of any Person other than the Agent and the Lenders or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the Borrowers will, forthwith upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Available Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account that are free and clear of any such right and interest. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit, to the extent funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law, and if so applied, then such reimbursement shall be deemed a repayment of the corresponding Advance in respect of such Letter of Credit. To the extent that any such Letter of Credit expires or otherwise terminates, and to the extent the applicable Issuing Bank's liability has ceased to exist under such Letter of Credit, and funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account in respect of such Letter of Credit, an amount equal to the undrawn amounts under such Letter of Credit shall be promptly returned from such L/C Cash Deposit Account to the Company. If any Event of Default has been waived or otherwise cured and no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
 
 
 
 
 
 
the balance, if any, in the L/C Cash Deposit Account shall be promptly returned to the Company. If, in accordance with this Section 6.02, the balance in the L/C Cash Deposit Account has not been otherwise returned, then after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon and all other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the Notes shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such L/C Cash Deposit Account shall be promptly returned to the Company."

Lenders
")     parties to the Credit Agreement     referred to below and to Citibank, N.A.,     as agent (the "

") for the Lenders
     
We refer to the

") and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "
Agent
") for the Lenders. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used with the meanings given to those terms in the Credit Agreement.
     A.   
Filing Events
     
We have advised you that the Company would be unable (a) to complete the preparation of, and to deliver, the audited financial statements of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 by April 5, 2005, and to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("

"). Any or all of the Filing Events may constitute a breach of the Company's obligations under Sections 5.01(h)(ii) and 5.01(h)(i) of the Credit Agreement, respectively. The Filing Events may also constitute a breach of Sections 5.01(a), 5.01(f) and other provisions of the Credit Agreement and may result in a breach of the other credit or ISDA agreements entered into by the Company and/or its Consolidated Subsidiaries, each of which may constitute a Default under the Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the Filing Events may result in the Company's inability to make the representation and warranty contained in the last sentence of Section 4.01(e).
     
The Company requests that the Lenders waive until September 30, 2005 with respect to the Filing Events, any breach, Default and related Event of Default in connection with the matters described in the preceding paragraph and any conditions precedent to borrowing contained in Section 3.03 of the Credit Agreement to the extent that the Company's inability to meet any such conditions relates to the Filing Events or any such breach, Default or Event of Default, in each case, solely to the extent related to the Filing Events.

As a result of this decline, (x) the Company may be in violation of Sections 5.03(a), 5.03(b) and 5.03(c) of the Credit Agreement and (y) the Company may not be able to make the representation and warranty contained in the last sentence of Section 4.01(e) of the Credit Agreement in connection with Borrowings made on or after the date hereof. To avoid any such violation or misrepresentation, the Company requests that the Lenders amend Section 5.03, as set forth in the accompanying Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement (the "
Amendment
") by executing and delivering such amendment.
     
The Credit Agreement, the Notes and the March 31 Waiver Letter (except as expressly superseded hereby) are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this letter agreement shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender or the Agent under the Credit Agreement, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Credit Agreement.

This letter agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this letter agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this letter agreement.
     
In accordance with Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement, this waiver will become effective as of the date when the Agent has received counterparts of this letter agreement executed by the Company and the Required Lenders or, as to any of the Lenders, advice satisfactory to the Agent that such Lender has executed this letter agreement.
     
This letter agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

INTERPUBLIC TO REPLACE DEPARTING CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Company Will File Financials by September 30;
Secures Waivers and Agreements to Credit Amendments
 
New York, NY (June 28, 2005)  The Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) today announced a number of important developments in the area of finance. Chief Financial Officer Robert Thompson has decided to leave the company. Interpublic has reached tentative agreement with an external candidate to serve as its new Chief Financial Officer. For reasons having to do with that individual's current professional situation, Interpublic is unable to formally announce his arrival at this time, but expects to do so during the second half of July.
 
The company further indicated that it expects to file its 2004 annual report on Form 10-K, as well as reports on Form 10-Q for both the first and second quarters of this year, by September 30, 2005. The company also said that it has secured from its bank syndicate waivers and amendments to its 364-day and three-year credit facilities. These waivers and amendments extend the company's financial filing deadline to September 30, extend the termination date of the 364-day facility through September 30 and make certain additional modifications to the terms of the credit agreements. In a Form 8-K regarding these developments to be filed today, the company also disclosed that its preliminary financial analysis currently indicated a likely moderate drop in revenue in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and higher operating expenses in the quarter than in the same period last year.
 
"Bob and I have independently come to the conclusion that the next steps in our company's progress will require new financial leadership," said Michael Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO. "Bob came to me late last week to indicate his desire to leave. Separately, the company had begun the process of seeking new financial leadership and we have reached tentative agreement with an external candidate who we look forward to having join us in early August. That person has
 
 
 
experience in senior finance roles in related industries  I look forward to having him as my new partner. The strong management teams at a number of our agencies, together with new players recently put into place at Lowe, FCB and Interpublic media, lead me to believe that we can succeed in getting Interpublic back on track. We thank Bob for his contributions and wish him well in the future." Effective immediately, Mr. Roth and Mr. Thompson will jointly manage the finance function to ensure a smooth transition until the arrival of the new CFO.
 
As regards the company's filing situation, Mr. Roth added, "I have always been clear that the control environment is our company's most pressing priority. We are making progress in addressing this key issue. We are confident that we will resolve the filing delay and be current with all our financial reporting by September 30. We appreciate the continued support from our bank syndicate. We also remain focused on serving our clients. The internal financial control situation has not had an effect on our ability to create and deliver world-class marketing programs that help clients build their brands and their business."
 
Interpublic indicated that its extensive financial analysis and review process continues to be substantially manual and broad, in both accounting and geographic scope. As previously disclosed, this review process has identified items that may require adjustments to prior period financial statements. Going forward, the company's plan to remediate internal control weaknesses includes rolling out an SAP information technology platform and continuing to develop shared services centers for financial reporting, as well as hiring and integrating new accounting personnel.
 
As agreed in its March 2005 amendments to indentures governing its five public debt issues, Interpublic will pay an additional fee of $1.25 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount to consenting bondholders due to the fact that that its financial filings will be made by September 30, 2005 but not by June 30, 2005.
