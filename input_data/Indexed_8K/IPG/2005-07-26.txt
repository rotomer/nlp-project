On July 25, 2005, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a fifth supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, to the senior debt indenture dated as of November 12, 2004 (attached as Exhibit 4.1 to The Company's current report on Form 8-K dated November 15, 2004)  (the "Senior Debt Indenture," together with the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Sun Trust Bank as trustee (the "Trustee") with respect to the issuance of $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "Notes").
 
The Notes were offered pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Notes were sold only to qualified institutional buyers as defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under, or applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
The Notes will mature on July 25, 2008 and will bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on the Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on January 25, April 25, July 25 and October 25 of each year, beginning October 25, 2005. The interest rate for the Notes for each interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points. The Notes will be the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations ranking equally with our other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
The Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring certain secured indebtedness and entering into sale and lease-back transactions and, with certain exceptions, prohibit the Company from merging into another person, or conveying, transferring or leasing all or substantially all of the Company's properties or assets.  If an event of default as specified in the Indenture shall occur and be continuing, either the Trustee or holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may accelerate the maturity of the Notes. The covenants, events of default and acceleration rights discussed in this paragraph are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the Indenture.
 
Interpublic received net proceeds of approximately $244.6 million from the offering.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale, together with cash on hand, to redeem or otherwise retire its outstanding $250 million 7 7/8% Notes due 2005 which mature on October 15, 2005.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the offering is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

(1)
           
The form of the Notes, including the form of the certificate of authentication, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
(2)
           
The Trustee shall authenticate or deliver the Notes for original issue in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000 upon a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of the Notes. The Company may from time to time issue additional Notes in accordance with Section 3.01 of the Base Indenture. The Notes issued originally hereunder, together with any additional Notes subsequently issued, shall be treated as a single class for purposes of the Indenture.
(3)
           
The aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes shall be due and payable at the Stated Maturity unless earlier repaid in accordance with this Supplemental Indenture.
(4)
           
The outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes shall bear interest for each Interest Period at a rate per annum as set forth in the Form of Note in Exhibit A hereto, as determined by the Calculation Agent, subject to the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on October 25, 2005, and at Maturity, to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on the Notes will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in an Interest Period and a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
(5)
           
If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity date is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest, as applicable, will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, except that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. No interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after the Maturity date to the date payment is made.
(6)
           
All amounts payable in connection with the Notes shall be denominated and payable in the lawful currency of the United States.
(7)
           
The Notes shall be payable and may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange, without service charge, at the office of the Company maintained for such purpose in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be the office or agency of the Trustee.
(8)
           
The Company may appoint and change any Calculation Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee, except that the Company will maintain at least one Paying Agent in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any agent not a party to the Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of the
 
 
 
 
 
Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent and any change in the address of such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Calculation Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar and/or agent for service of notices and demands, the Trustee shall act as such Calculation Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or agent for service of notices and demands. The Company may remove any Calculation Agent, Paying Agent or Security Registrar upon written notice to such Calculation Agent, Paying Agent or Security Registrar and the Trustee;
provided
that no such removal shall become effective until (i) the acceptance of an appointment by a successor Calculation Agent, Paying Agent or Security Registrar as evidenced by an appropriate agency agreement entered into by the Company and such successor and delivered to the Trustee or (ii) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as such Paying Agent or Security Registrar until the appointment of a successor agent in accordance with clause (i) of this proviso. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Calculation Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar.
(9)
           
Article 12 of the Base Indenture shall have no force or effect in respect of, or application to, the Notes.
(10)
         
The Base Indenture is hereby amended, with respect to the Notes only, by replacing the words, "other than the Securities of such series" with the words "other than the Floating Rate Notes due 2008" in paragraph (5) of Section 5.01.
(11)

"
L/C Cash Deposit Account
" means any interest bearing cash deposit account established and maintained for the benefit of any lender under any credit agreement entered into by and among the Company and such lender, over which the lender or its agent shall have sole dominion and control, upon terms as may be satisfactory to such lender or its agent.
(1)
           
Payments
. Payments of principal and interest on the Notes shall be made in the manner provided for in the Notes.
(2)
           
Holder Lists
. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Security Registrar, the Company shall furnish, or cause the Security Registrar to furnish, to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.

Quarterly interest on the Notes that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Notes

Each installment of quarterly interest on the Notes shall be paid in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States.
(b)
           
Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Notes, any quarterly interest on the Notes that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any applicable payment date (herein called "
Defaulted Interest
"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Company as provided for in Section 3.07 of the Base Indenture.
(c)

ARTICLE 3
GLOBAL SECURITIES
SECTION 3.01.
  
Form.
The Notes shall initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities. The Company shall execute and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver such Global Security or Securities in the manner provided for in Article 2 of the Base Indenture.
SECTION 3.02.
  
Transfer
.  Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes in certificated form, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture, only to a nominee of the Depositary for such Global Security, or to the Depositary, or a successor Depositary for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company, or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
(1) If at any time the Depositary for a Global Security notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Global Security. If a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent, upon receipt of a written request by the Company for the authentication and delivery of Notes in certificated form in exchange for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver, Notes in
 
 
 
 
 
certificated form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the outstanding Principal Amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.
(2) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Notes or any portion thereof issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent, upon receipt of a written request by the Company for the authentication and delivery of Notes in certificated form in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver Notes in certificated form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the outstanding Principal Amount of such Global Security or Securities representing such series or portion thereof in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
(3) If specified by the Company with respect to Notes issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Notes in certificated form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, without service-charge, (a) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Note or Notes of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (b) to such Depositary a new Global Security in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the Principal Amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate Principal Amount of Notes delivered to the Holders thereof.
(4) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company shall execute and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver Notes in certificated form in authorized denominations. Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of a Global Security for Notes in certificated form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee or the Security Registrar. Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, Notes issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or the Security Registrar. The Trustee or the Security Registrar shall deliver such Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are so registered.
SECTION 3.04.
  
Transfer Restrictions
. (1) Notes shall be stamped or otherwise be imprinted with the Restricted Securities Legend. The Restricted Securities Legend may be removed from such Notes, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order, (i) two years from the later of issuance of the Note or the date such Note (or any Predecessor Note) was last acquired from an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (ii) in connection with a sale made pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act following one year from such time, or (iii) in connection with any sale in a transaction registered under the Securities Act, provided that, if the legend is removed and the Note is subsequently held by such an affiliate of the Company, the legend shall be reinstated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) Upon the transfer of beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Security under circumstances permitting the removal of the Restricted Securities Legend contemplated in Section 3.04(1) if the Notes represented by such beneficial interest were not in the form of a Global Security, such transferred beneficial interests shall be represented by a beneficial interest in a Global Security that is not a Restricted Global Security.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The Notes shall bear interest for each Interest Period at a rate per annum determined by the Calculation Agent, subject to the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law. The rate at which interest on the Notes shall be payable during each quarterly Interest Period shall be equal to Three-Month LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date for such Interest Period plus 325 basis point. Promptly upon determination of the rate, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next Interest Period.

Upon request from any Holder, the Calculation Agent will provide notice of the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period. Interest on the Notes will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in an Interest Period and a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan;

If at any time the Notes of this series are no longer represented by global
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes and are issued in definitive certificated form, then the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each certificated Note at Maturity shall be paid in same day funds to the Holder upon surrender of such certificated Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other place or places as may be designated in or pursuant to the Indenture;
provided
that such certificated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or at such other place or places as may be designated in or pursuant to the Indenture, in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Payments of interest with respect to such certificated Notes other than at Maturity may, at the option of the Company, be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears on the Security Register on the relevant Regular or Special Record Date or by wire transfer in same day funds to such account as may have been appropriately designated to the Paying Agent by such Person in writing not later than such relevant Regular or Special Record Date.

Such interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date of each year, commencing on October 25, 2005, to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall make payments in respect of the Notes to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes as of the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Maturity date, as the case may be. Holders must surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Notes.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or property held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Notes that remains unclaimed for two years;
provided, however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such return, shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money or property remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed money or property then remaining shall be returned to the Company.

Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which shall result in the Notes being declared due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
Events of Default in respect of the Notes are set forth in Section 5.01 of the Base Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (i) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
The Company's failure to comply with Section 7.04(1) of the Base Indenture prior to 5:30 p.m., September 30, 2005, New York City time, shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Notes.

Exhibit 99.1  
 
INTERPUBLIC COMPLETES NOTES OFFERING
 
New York, NY (July 26, 2005)  The Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) announced today that on July 25, 2005, it had completed its previously announced offering of an aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "Notes"). The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in a private placement in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Interpublic received net proceeds of approximately $244.6 million from the offering.
 
The Notes will mature on July 25, 2008 and will bear interest at a floating rate. The interest rate for the Notes for each interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on January 25, April 25, July 25 and October 25 of each year, beginning October 25, 2005. The Notes will be Interpublic's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations ranking equally with its other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The terms of the Notes are otherwise similar to those terms governing Interpublic's current debt securities.
 
Interpublic intends to use the net proceeds from the sale, together with cash on hand, to redeem or otherwise retire its outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7 7/8% Notes due 2005 which mature on October 15, 2005. After those notes mature, the next scheduled maturity of Interpublic's long-term debt (other than the Notes themselves) is in 2009.
 
"We appreciate the support of all of our investors, and are pleased to have completed this transaction, which further demonstrates their confidence in our company," said Interpublic's Chairman and CEO Michael Roth. "This financing continues our conservative approach to financial management, appropriate at this stage of our company's turnaround. After addressing the October maturity with these proceeds, we have no significant debt maturities for the next three years."
