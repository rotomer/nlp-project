Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York, NY (September 30, 2005)  The Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) today released results for 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005. The company also provided detail on its restatement of results for periods from 2000 and prior through the nine months ended 2004. Interpublic has completed a comprehensive six-month internal management review of its previously disclosed material control weaknesses. These were the result of the company's extensive global presence, a highly decentralized structure and poor integration of past acquisitions. By filing today, the company became current with its federal financial filing requirements and the requirements of its bond indentures. Separately, the company indicated that it has successfully amended the terms of its $450 million, three-year credit facility with its bank syndicate.
Key results contained in the filings include:
 
"I've been clear for some time that addressing control issues is our top priority. The results of the financial review and restatement process demonstrate our commitment to the integrity of our financial statements and to a new level of transparency, in terms of both our disclosure and the way in which we do business," said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic Chairman and CEO. "I am pleased that our organic revenue trend stabilized in 2004 and continues to be positive in 2005. This is a testament to the great work and the value that our agencies and our people continue to deliver to clients. However, we are clearly not yet where we need to be on revenue or on the expense side. We have identified a number of areas that could drive significant improvement and we will pursue them vigorously. The investments we are making in bringing top talent and new management teams to many of our companies should also begin to yield continued and improved top line performance."
First Half 2005 Operating Results
Revenue
Revenue increased 1.5% in the first six months of 2005 to $2.95 billion, compared with the year-ago period. This reflects the benefit of foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth. Currency effect was 1.4%. Net divestitures had a negative impact of 1.2% on revenue. Organic revenue was 1.3% over the first half of 2004.
In the United States, reported revenue increased 0.4% and organic revenue growth was 1.0% over the same period in 2004. Non-U.S. reported revenue increased 3.0% in the first half of 2005 compared to 2004. Currency effect was 3.2%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 2.0% and the resulting organic revenue change was 1.8%.
 
Operating Expenses
During the first half of 2005, salary and related expenses were $1.93 billion, an increase of 8.1%, or 6.7% in constant currency, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase reflects hiring of global finance personnel and increased headcount at certain units.
Compared to the same period in 2004, first half 2005 office and general expenses increased 0.2% to $1.07 billion. Adjusted for currency, office and general expenses decreased 1.2%. This decrease reflects an increase in professional fees, offset largely by lower occupancy costs and some benefits from the company's initiative to consolidate purchasing of major services and supplies.
Non-Operating and Tax
Other income of $19.1 million in the first half of 2005 was largely attributable to the sale of minority interests in several small, non-core, non-U.S. operations in Europe.
In the first six months of 2005, provision for income taxes was $44.7 million as compared to $1.6 million in the same period of 2004. The company's tax rate was adversely affected by losses incurred in non-U.S. jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than U.S. statutory rates or no tax benefit to the company.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2005, cash and equivalents totaled $1.58 billion, up from $1.55 billion at the same point in 2004. At the end of the first half of 2005, Interpublic's total debt was $2.3 billion, the same level as at June 30, 2004. The company's debt maturity schedule provides it with significant financial flexibility, as no maturities are due until 2008.
Restatement Detail
 
As part of the financial review necessitated by material weaknesses in internal controls, begun in March 2005, the company determined in September 2005 that a restatement of results of prior periods was required. This review was overseen by the Audit Committee of the company's Board of Directors.
The restatement will reduce retained earnings at September 30, 2004 by $514 million plus a $36 million adjustment through comprehensive income for a reduction in shareholder's equity at September 30, 2004 of approximately $550 million. Approximately 50% of the reduction in shareholders' equity relates to periods prior to 2002. An estimated $250 million will result in cash payments over the next 24 months.
As previously disclosed, the major restatement categories include revenue recognition, acquisition accounting, internal investigations and international compensation arrangements. Adjustments related to revenue recognition involved vendor credits for volume and cash discounts, principally for the purchase of media in international markets, as well as timing of revenue recognition and the decision to account for certain types of business on a gross versus net revenue basis. Acquisition accounting included improper accounting for pre-acquisition earnings, as well as consideration paid to previous owners of acquired companies as a component of purchase price (e.g. goodwill) when it should have been treated as compensation.
The effect on retained earnings at September 30, 2004 of the major restatement items was as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Adjustments related to the timing of revenue recognition reduced retained earnings by $256.6 million, as the company's review of more than 20,000 contracts found that some has been inconsistently followed, while other were unclear or did not exist.
Adjustments related to vendor discounts or credits reduced retained earnings by $184.5 million. The company has indicated that, as part of the new management's commitment to a higher level of scrutiny and transparency, it has sought to reconcile proper GAAP accounting with local practices, particularly in the media buying business in certain international markets.
 
Acquisition Accounting
Adjustments for future obligations ("earn-outs") related to prior acquisitions reduced retained earnings by $70.4 million. Adjustments for improper pre-acquisition accounting, in which the company incorrectly recorded the revenue and expenses of acquired businesses prior to the closing date of the acquisition, reduced retained earnings by $34.8 million.
Internal Investigations
Adjustments related to internal investigations reduced retained earnings by $55.9 million. These investigations were launched as a result of instances that came to the attention of management due to the company's anti-fraud program and the extended scope of financial review. As previously indicated, instances in which the company believes there was malfeasance do not involve current senior level employees at any of our operating units or within the corporate group. These cases took place primarily outside of the United States. Seven instances of employee misconduct account for approximately 80% of the adjustment in this category.
International Compensation Agreements
Adjustments related to international compensation agreements reduced retained earnings by $33.3 million. Although these practices for compensating employees are common in international markets, they do not meet the standard of transparency required by Interpublic.
Other Adjustments
Adjustments relating to goodwill and investment impairment charges increased retained earnings by $145.2 million. The largest of these was the reversal of a portion of a third quarter 2004 goodwill impairment charge. Adjustments related to all other restatement items, of which improper accounting for leases was the largest, reduced retained earnings by $23.7 million.
2004 Operating Results
Revenue
Compared with 2003, revenue increased 3.7% in 2004 to $6.4 billion. This reflects the benefit of foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth. Currency impacted revenue by 3.9%.
 
Net divestitures had a negative impact of 1.4% on revenue. Organic revenue growth was 1.2% over 2003.
For 2004, reported revenue in the United States increased 1.5%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 1.0% and organic revenue growth was 2.5% over 2003. Non-U.S. reported revenue increased 6.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. Currency effect was 8.8%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 1.9% and the resulting organic revenue change was negative 0.4%.
Operating Expenses
During 2004, salary and related expenses were $3.7 billion, an increase of 6.7%, or 2.9% in constant currency, compared to 2003. The increase reflects hiring of global finance personnel, increased headcount at certain units to support new business.
Compared to 2003, office and general expenses in 2004 increased 1.1% to $2.2 billion. Adjusted for currency, office and general expenses decreased 3.4%. This decrease was driven largely by the company's 2003 restructuring program, offset partially by higher professional fees.
Restructuring and Other Charges
During 2004, the company incurred restructuring charges of $62.2 million, relating primarily to the completion of the 2003 restructuring program. Restructuring charges in 2003 were $172.9 million. Long-lived asset impairment charges in 2004 totaled $322.2 million, principally related to a goodwill impairment at the company's The Partnership and CMG units as a result of the annual impairment test. Long-lived asset impairment charges in 2003 totaled $294.0 million. In 2004, the company also incurred a charge of $113.6 million related to its termination of its Motorspots contracts.
Non-Operating and Tax
Investment impairments of $63.4 million in 2004 related principally to an unconsolidated investment in a German advertising agency as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Investment impairments in 2003 were $71.5 million.
 
For 2004, provision for income taxes was $262.2 million, as compared to $242.7 million in 2003. The company's tax rate was adversely affected by losses incurred in non-U.S. jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than U.S. statutory rates or no tax benefit to the company.
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion, as compared to $2.1 billion at the same point in 2003. At the end of 2004, Interpublic's total debt was $2.3 billion, down from $2.5 billion at the same point in 2003.
