Item 3.02           Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities.
     
On October 24, 2005, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. completed a private offering of 525,000 shares of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Shares") at an aggregate offering price of $525,000,000. The Shares were sold on October 18, 2005 in a private placement to a syndicate of initial purchasers at an aggregate discount of $15,750,000 and may be resold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The initial purchasers have an overallotment option to purchase an additional 75,000 Shares. Interpublic intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.
     
Each Share is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into 73.1904 shares of Interpublic common stock, subject to adjustment, which represents a conversion price of approximately $13.66, representing a conversion premium of approximately 30% over Interpublic's closing stock price on October 18, 2005 of $10.51 per share. On or after October 15, 2010, the Shares may be converted at Interpublic's option if the closing price of Interpublic's common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period. Holders of the Shares will be entitled to an adjustment to the conversion rate if they convert their Shares in connection with a fundamental change meeting certain specified conditions.
     
Dividends of 5.25% per year are payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at Interpublic's option on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year. The dividend rate will be increased by 1.0% and all the series of preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to elect two additional directors to the board in the event Interpublic does not pay dividends on the Shares for six quarterly periods. The dividend rate will be similarly increased if Interpublic does not file its periodic reports with the SEC within the 15 days of the required filing date.
     
The certificate of designations governing the rights of the Shares is filed as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated by referenced herein. A copy of the press release published in connection with the completion of the offering is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 4.1
 
CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF
5% SERIES B CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK
OF THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.
Pursuant to Section 151 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), certifies that pursuant to the authority contained in Article 4 of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Restated Certificate of Incorporation"), and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the Pricing Committee designated by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") by resolution adopted by unanimous written consent, pursuant to Section 141(f) of the DGCL, on October 18, 2005, duly approved and adopted the following resolution, which resolution remains in full force and effect on the date hereof:
RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Pricing Committee by the Board of Directors, and in the Board of Directors by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the Pricing Committee designated by the Board of Directors does hereby designate, create, authorize and provide for the issue of a series of the Company's preferred stock without par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount equal to the sum of all accumulated and unpaid dividends, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 19(ii) hereof, which shall be designated as 5% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") consisting of 600,000 shares, no shares of which have heretofore been issued by the Company, having the following powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof:
Section 1.
Ranking
. The Series B Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company: (i) senior to all Junior Stock, (ii) on parity with all Parity Stock and (iii) junior to all Senior Stock. The Company's ability to issue Capital Stock that ranks senior to its Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof.
Section 2.
Dividends
.
(i) Each holder of shares of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock (together, the "Holders") shall be entitled, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of assets of the Company legally available therefor, to receive cumulative dividends at the initial rate per annum of 5.25% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 19(ii) hereof (such liquidation preference, as adjusted from time to time, the "Liquidation Preference") (initially equivalent to $52.50 per annum per share) payable quarterly in arrears (such rate, as the same may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section 2(ii) and Section 13, the "Dividend
 
 
 
 
 
Rate"). Dividends payable for each full dividend period will be computed by dividing the Dividend Rate by four and shall be payable in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date (commencing January 15, 2006) for the quarterly period ending immediately prior to such Dividend Payment Date, to the holders of record of Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business on the Dividend Record Date applicable to such Dividend Payment Date. Such dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as to which dividends shall have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the Issue Date (whether or not in any dividend period or periods there shall be assets of the Company legally available for the payment of such dividends in whole or in part). The initial dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, for the period commencing on October 24, 2005, to but excluding January 15, 2006, shall be $11.8125 per share and shall be payable, when, as and if declared, on January 15, 2006. Each subsequent quarterly dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared, shall be $13.125 per share. Dividends payable for any partial dividend period, including the initial dividend period ending immediately prior to January 15, 2006, shall be computed on the basis of days elapsed over a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(ii) If and whenever six full quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, payable on the Series B Preferred Stock (such period, the "Initial Six-Quarter Period") are not paid, then the Dividend Rate shall increase by one percentage point (100 basis points), and at such date as the Company has paid in full all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to such date, the Dividend Rate shall decrease by one percentage point (100 basis points). After the Initial Six-Quarter Period and the taking of action by the Company to cause a decrease in the Dividend Rate as provided in the prior sentence, if and whenever one full quarterly dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock is not paid, the Dividend Rate shall increase by one percentage point (100 basis points) until the Company has paid in full all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to the date on which the accumulated and unpaid dividends are paid in full.
(iii) No dividend will be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart or shares of Common Stock distributed for the payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to any dividend period unless all dividends for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid or declared and a sufficient sum of money or number of shares of Common Stock have been set apart or shares of Common Stock distributed for the payment of such dividend, upon all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
(iv) No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 17 hereof) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or are
 
 
 
 
 
declared and a sum of cash or number of shares of Common Stock sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid pro rata so that the amounts of dividends declared per share on the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.
(v) Holders shall not be entitled to any dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends calculated pursuant to this Section 2. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series B Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.
(vi) With respect to dividends that have been declared for payment, a Holder at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payment on its Series B Preferred Stock on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the Company's default in payment of the dividend due on that Dividend Payment Date.
(vii) Dividends in arrears on the Series B Preferred Stock in respect of a dividend period not declared for payment ("Delayed Dividends") may be declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and paid on any date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, whether or not a Dividend Payment Date, to the Holders of record as they appear on the stock register of the Company on a record date selected by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, which shall (a) not precede the date the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof declares the dividend payable and (b) not be more than 60 days prior to the date the dividend is paid.
Section 2A.
Method of Payment of Dividends
.
(i) Subject to restrictions set forth herein, dividends on Series B Preferred Stock may be paid, at the sole discretion of the Company, (a) in cash; (b) by delivery of shares of Common Stock; or (c) through any combination of cash or Common Stock.

(iii) Dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock will be made in cash, except to the extent the Company elects to make all or any portion of such payment in Common Stock by giving notice to Holders and issuing a press release, each in accordance with Section 2A(v) and Section 14 hereof, of such election at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to the Dividend Record Date for such dividend.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(iv) During the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Issue Date, no payment or partial payment of a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock may be made by delivery of Common Stock unless:
(a) an effective registration statement exists at the time of delivery of such shares of Common Stock; or
(b) in the case of dividends paid by delivery of shares of Common Stock issued on or after the first anniversary of the Issue Date, at the time of delivery of such shares, the Company satisfies the requirements of Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act.
(v) The notice and press release specified in Section 2A(iii) will set forth the portion of such payment that will be made in cash and the portion that will be made in shares of Common Stock. In addition, with respect to any such payment to be made during the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Issue Date, such notice will:
(a) with respect to delivery of shares of Common Stock for which the Company relies on Section 2A(iv)(a) above, state whether an effective registration statement exists and is available for resales of shares of Common Stock that are issued in respect of dividends; and
(b) with respect to delivery of shares of Common Stock for which the Company relies on Section 2A(iv)(b) above:

(4) include a statement that investors may be required to make certain filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and other regulatory authorities in relation to any resales of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
(vi) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be delivered to Holders in payment or partial payment of a dividend. In lieu of delivery of a fractional share, a cash adjustment will be paid to each Holder in accordance with Section 17 hereof. Any portion of any
 
 
 
 
 
such payment that is declared and not paid through the delivery of Common Stock will be paid in cash.
Section 3.
Liquidation Preference
.
(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company, each Holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders of the Company, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of the Common Stock or any other Junior Stock but after any distribution on the indebtedness of the Company or Senior Stock, the Liquidation Preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) thereon for the then-current dividend period to the date fixed for liquidation, winding up or dissolution and all dividend periods prior thereto.
(ii) Neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the assets or business of the Company (other than in connection with the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of its business) nor the merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person shall be deemed to be a liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 3.
(iii) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to Holders upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such Holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3(i), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which Holders and holders of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, with the amount allocable to each series of such stock determined on a pro rata basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and accumulated and unpaid dividends to which each series is entitled.
(iv) After the payment to the Holders of full preferential amounts provided for in Sections 3(i), 3(ii) and 3(iii) hereof, the Holders as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.
Section 4.
Voting Rights
.
(i) Holders shall have no voting rights, except as set forth in this Section 4 or as expressly required by applicable state law from time to time.
(ii) If and whenever six full quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, on any series of preferred stock of the Company, including the Series B Preferred Stock, are not paid, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be increased by two and the holders of all series of the preferred stock of the Company (including the Series B Preferred Stock) then outstanding, voting together as a class, shall have a right to elect those additional directors to the Board of Directors until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the cumulative
 
 
 
 
 
preferred stock of the Company have been paid in full or, to the extent that any series of non-cumulative preferred stock of the Company is outstanding, until non-cumulative dividends have been paid regularly for at least a year. To exercise this right, any holder of any series of the Company's preferred stock then outstanding, including the Series B Preferred Stock, may by written notice request that the Company call a special meeting of the holders of the Company's preferred stock for the purpose of electing the additional directors and, if such non-payment of dividends is continuing, the Company shall call such meeting within 35 days after such written request. If the Company fails to call such a meeting upon request, any holder at such time of any series of the Company's preferred stock then outstanding, including the Series B Preferred Stock, may call a meeting. At such time as all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the cumulative preferred stock of the Company are paid and, in the case of any series of non-cumulative preferred stock of the Company, all non-cumulative dividends have been paid regularly for at least one year, the holders of the Company's preferred stock then outstanding will no longer have the right to vote on directors and the term of office of each director so elected will terminate and the number of directors will, without further action, be reduced by two.
(iii) So long as any Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding, in addition to any other vote of stockholders of the Company required under applicable law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will be required (a) for any amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Holders so as to affect them adversely, (b) to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any class or series of Senior Stock, or (c) to reclassify by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any authorized stock of the Company into any class or series of, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Senior Stock;
provided
that no such vote shall be required for the Company to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock.
(iv) In any case where the Holders are entitled to vote as a class with holders of Parity Stock, each holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such preferred stock (including the Series B Preferred Stock) held by such holder. In any case where the Holders are entitled to vote as a class, each Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of the Series B Preferred Stock held by such Holder.
Section 5.
Forced Conversion
.
(i) At any time on or after October 15, 2010, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to cause the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, to be automatically converted into a number of whole shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate then in effect, with any resulting fractional shares of Common Stock to be settled in accordance with Section 17 hereof (a "Forced Conversion"). The Company may exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion pursuant to this Section 5 only if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock multiplied by the Conversion Rate equals or exceeds 130% of the Liquidation Preference for at least 20 Trading Days in any consecutive 30 Trading Day period, including the last
 
 
 
 
 
Trading Day of such 30 Trading Day period, ending on the Trading Day prior to the Company's issuance of a press release, as described in Section 5(ii) hereof, announcing the Company's exercise of its right to cause Forced Conversion.
(ii) To exercise its right to call a Forced Conversion described in Section 5(i) hereof, the Company must issue a press release, in compliance with Section 14(i) hereof, prior to the close of business on the first Trading Day following any date on which the conditions described in Section 5(i) hereof are met, announcing such a Forced Conversion. The Company shall also give notice by mail or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by mail), in either case in accordance with Section 14(ii) hereof, to the Holders (not more than four Business Days after the date of the press release) of the election to call a Forced Conversion. The conversion date will be a date selected by the Company (the "Forced Conversion Date") and will be no more than 15 days after the date on which the Company issues the press release described in this Section 5(ii).
(iii) In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the press release and
notice of a Forced Conversion described in Section 5(ii) shall state, as appropriate: (a) the Forced
Conversion Date; (b) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock; (c) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted; and (d) that dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock to be converted will cease to accumulate on the Forced Conversion Date.
(iv) On and after the Forced Conversion Date, dividends will cease to accumulate on the Series B Preferred Stock called for a Forced Conversion and all rights of Holders will terminate except for the right to receive the whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof at the Conversion Rate then in effect and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock, settled in accordance with Section 17 hereof. If the Forced Conversion Date occurs between the period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date and the close of business on any Dividend Payment Date, the dividend payment with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock will be payable to the record holder of such share on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to a Forced Conversion pursuant to Section 5(i) hereof, the Company shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock or for dividends with respect to the Common Stock issued upon such conversion.
(v) The Company may not authorize, issue a press release or give notice of any Forced Conversion pursuant to Section 5(i) hereof unless, prior to giving the notice of Forced Conversion, all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for periods ended prior to the date of such notice shall have been paid.
(vi) In addition to the Company's right to call a Forced Conversion described in Section 5(i) hereof, if there are fewer than 39,375 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Company shall have the right, at any time on or after October 15, 2010, at its option, to cause the Series B Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (a) the Liquidation Preference divided by (b) the lesser of (1) the Conversion Price then in effect and (2) the Market Value as of the second Trading Day immediately prior to the Forced Conversion Date, with any resulting fractional shares of
 
 
 
 
 
Common Stock to be settled in cash in accordance with Section 17 hereof. The provisions of Sections 5(ii), 5(iii), 5(iv) and 5(v) shall apply to any such forced conversion pursuant to this Section 5(vi);
provided, however,
that to exercise the right described in this Section 5(vi), the Company must issue a press release at any time following satisfaction of the condition described in this Section 5(vi).
Section 6.
Conversion at the Option of the Holder
.
(i) Each Holder shall have the right, at any time, at its option, from the Issue Date to convert any or all of such Holder's shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 73.1904 shares of Common Stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 7 hereof (such rate, the "Conversion Rate").
(ii) Shares of Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion during the period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by a payment in cash equal to the dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock on that Dividend Payment Date. A Holder on a Dividend Record Date who (or whose transferee) tenders any shares for conversion on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall receive the dividend payable by the Company on the Series B Preferred Stock on that date, and the converting holder shall not be required to include payment in the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion. Except as provided in this Section 6(ii), upon a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to this Section 6, the Company shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock or for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion.
(iii) Subject to Section 19(i) hereof, the conversion right of a Holder shall be exercised by the Holder by the surrender to the Company of the certificates representing shares of Series B Preferred Shares to be converted at any time during usual business hours at its principal place of business or the offices of its duly appointed Transfer Agent to be maintained by it, accompanied by written notice to the Company in the form of Exhibit A that the Holder elects to convert all or a portion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented by such certificate and specifying the name or names (with address) in which a certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued and (if so required by the Company or its duly appointed Transfer Agent) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company or its duly appointed Transfer Agent duly executed by the Holder or its duly authorized legal representative and transfer tax stamps or funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section 19(vii) hereof. Immediately prior to the close of business on the date of receipt by the Company or its duly appointed Transfer Agent of notice of conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, each converting Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holder's Series B Preferred Stock notwithstanding that the share register of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such Holder. On the date of any conversion, all rights with respect to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices, will terminate, except the rights of Holders thereof to: (a) receive certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock into
 
 
 
 
 
which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been converted and cash, in lieu of any fractional shares, in accordance with Section 17 hereof; (b) receive a Make-Whole Premium, if any, payable upon a Fundamental Change, in accordance with Section 8A; and (c) exercise the rights to which they are entitled as holders of Common Stock.
Section 7.
Anti-dilution Adjustments
.
(i)
Anti-Dilution Adjustments
. The Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments from time to time:
(a)
Stock Dividends
. In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
(b)
Stock Purchase Rights
. In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock rights, options or warrants, entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants at a price per share of Common Stock less than the Market Value as of the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such rights, options or warrants (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;
provided, however
, that no such adjustment of Conversion Rate shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants upon conversion at any time of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into
 
 
 
 
 
Common Stock;
provided further, however
, that
if any of the foregoing rights, options or warrants is only exercisable upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, then the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted until such Triggering Event occurs.
(c)
Stock Splits; Reverse Splits; and Combinations
. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination becomes effective.
(d)
Cash Distributions
. In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, make distributions to all holders of its Common Stock exclusively in cash (excluding any distribution consisting of cash in part which is provided for in Section 7(i)(f) hereof) immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Market Value as of the date fixed for such determination and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Market Value as of the date fixed for such determination less the per share amount of the distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will an adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(i)(d) result in a Conversion Rate of more than 95.1475, subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 7(i)(a), 7(i)(b), 7(i)(c), 7(i)(e) and 7(i)(f) hereof.
(e)
Common Stock Repurchase Premiums
. In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate consideration having a Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of the Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the last day (such day, the "Expiration Time") tenders
 
 
 
 
 
could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the Conversion Rate shall be increased by dividing the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the Expiration Time by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Market Value as of the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares (as defined below)) on the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the Fair Market Value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below)), and (2) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Market Value as of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares (as defined below)) on the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the Expiration Time (such validly tendered shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares").
(f)
Debt, Asset or Security Distributions
. In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any dividend or distributions referred to in Section 7(i)(a), (i)(b) or (i)(d)), the Conversion Rate shall be increased by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date fixed for such determination less the then Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date fixed for such determination, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution.
(ii)
Right and Warrants
.
If the Company distributes rights or warrants (other than those referred to above in Section 7(i)(b) hereof) pro rata to the holders of Common Stock, so long as such rights or warrants have not expired or been redeemed by the Company, the Holder of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock then issuable upon such conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number of rights or warrants to be determined as follows:
(a) if such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the distribution to the holders of rights or warrants of separate certificates evidencing such rights or warrants (the "Distribution Date"), the same number of rights or
 
 
 
 
 
warrants to which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions applicable to the rights or warrants; and
(b) if such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same number of rights or warrants to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series B Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such Distribution Date would have been entitled on such Distribution Date had such Series B Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to such Distribution Date in accordance with the terms and provisions applicable to the rights and warrants.
The Conversion Rate shall not be subject to adjustment on account of any declaration, distribution or exercise of such rights or warrants.
(iii)
De Minimis Adjustments
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 7 need be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1.0%) of the Conversion Rate then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1.0%) of such Conversion Rate;
provided, however
, that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Conversion Rate in connection with cash dividends paid by the Company, the Company shall make such adjustments, regardless of whether such aggregate adjustments amount to one percent (1.0%) or more of the Conversion Rate, no later than October 15 of each calendar year. No adjustment under this Section 7 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a Conversion Price that is less than the par value of the Common Stock. All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).
(iv)
Tax-Related Adjustments
. The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 7, as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. In the event the Company elects to make such an increase in the Conversion Rate, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the increase of the Conversion Rate.
(v)
Stockholder Rights Plans
. Upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Holders shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock and any cash for fractional shares in accordance with Section 17 hereof, if any, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company may establish whether or not such rights are separated from the Common Stock prior to conversion. A distribution of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan will not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7(i)(b) or 7(i)(f) provided that the Company has provided for the Holders to receive such rights upon conversion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(vi)
Notice of Adjustment
. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted in accordance with this Section 7, the Company shall (a) compute the Conversion Rate in accordance with this Section 7 and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (b) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 7 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Transfer Agent shall provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate.
(vii)
Reversal of Adjustment
. If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Rate then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.
(viii)
Exceptions to Adjustment
. The applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(a) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(b) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date;
(d) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
(e) for accumulated and unpaid dividends.
Section 8.
Fundamental Change
.
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, each Holder that converts its Series B Preferred Stock at any time beginning at the opening of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change described in paragraph (b)
 
 
 
 
 
of the definition of Fundamental Change and ending at the close of business on the 30th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date, shall receive:
(a) Common Stock, in accordance with Section 6 hereof, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with Section 17 hereof; and
(b) a Make-Whole Premium (as defined below), if any, in accordance with Section 8A.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, in the event that the Market Value as of the Effective Date of any Fundamental Change multiplied by the Conversion Rate then in effect is less than the Liquidation Preference, each Holder shall have a one-time option (the "Fundamental Change Option") to convert all of such Holder's outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at an adjusted Conversion Rate equal to the lesser of (x) the Liquidation Preference, divided by the Market Value as of the Effective Date and (y) 146.3808. The Fundamental Change Option must be exercised, if at all, during the period of not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the Fundamental Change Notice Date. In lieu of issuing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion in the event of a Fundamental Change, the Company may, at its option, make a cash payment equal to the Market Value as of such Effective Date for each share of such Common Stock otherwise issuable.
(iii) In the event of a Fundamental Change, within ten (10) Trading Days after the Effective Date, the Company shall give notice of such Fundamental Change, in accordance with Section 14(ii) hereof, to each record holder (such date of notice, the "Fundamental Change Notice Date"). Each such notice shall state: (a) that a Fundamental Change has occurred; (b) the last day on which the Make-Whole Premium (as defined below), if any, can be received upon conversion and the last day on which the Fundamental Change Option may be exercised (each such date, an "Expiration Date") pursuant to the terms hereof; (c) the procedures that Holders must follow to exercise the Fundamental Change Option; (d) the name and address of the Transfer Agent; and (e) any additional information as may be required to be included in such notice pursuant to Section 8A(iv) or Section 9(ii) hereof.
(iv) Subject to Section 19(i) hereof, on or before the applicable Expiration Date, each Holder wishing to exercise its conversion right pursuant to Section 8(i) and (ii) shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted, in the manner and at the place designated in the notice described in Section 8(iii), and the cash or shares of Common Stock due to such Holder shall be delivered promptly to the Person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and the shares represented by each surrendered certificate shall be returned to authorized but unissued shares. Upon surrender (in accordance with the notice described in Section 8(iii) hereof) of the certificate or certificates representing any shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be so converted (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be converted by the Company at the adjusted Conversion Rate, if applicable, as described in Section 8(ii) hereof. Each converting Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holder's Series B Preferred Stock notwithstanding that the share register of the Company shall then be closed or
 
 
 
 
 
that certificates representing such Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such Holder.
(v) The rights of Holders pursuant to this Section 8 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the rights of Holders provided for in Section 6 and Section 8A hereof.
Section 8A.
Payment of Make-Whole Premium
.
(i) If a Holder elects to convert its Series B Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change as described in paragraph (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Company shall deliver to such Holder upon conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, in accordance with Section 6 hereof, and cash for fractional shares, in accordance with Section 17 hereof, a make-whole premium (the "Make-Whole Premium"):
(a) equal to a percentage of the Liquidation Preference as determined by reference to the table in Section 8A(viii) hereof, based on the Effective Date and the price (the "Stock Price") paid, or deemed to be paid, per share of Common Stock in the transaction constituting the Fundamental Change, subject to adjustment as described below; and
(b) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any cash, securities or other assets otherwise due to Holders upon conversion.
(ii) The Make-Whole Premium will be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, which will be settled in accordance with Section 17) or in the same form of consideration into which all or substantially all of the Common Stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with the Fundamental Change (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional interests in any security or pursuant to dissenters' rights), subject, in the case of delivery of Common Stock, to the Company's satisfaction of the conditions described in Section 8A(iii).
(iii) During the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Issue Date, a payment or partial payment of a Make-Whole Premium on the Series B Preferred Stock may be made by delivery of shares of Common Stock only if:
(a) an effective registration statement exists at the time of delivery of such shares of Common Stock; or
(b) in the case of Common Stock issued as payment of a Make-Whole Premium on or after the first anniversary of the Issue Date, at the time of delivery of such shares, the Company satisfies the requirements of Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act.
(iv) Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change for which a Make-Whole Premium is payable, the Company shall include in the notice required to be issued pursuant to Section 8(iii) the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) a calculation of the portion of the Make-Whole Premium payment that will be made in cash and the portion of such payment that will be made in shares of Common Stock;
(b) with respect to delivery of shares of Common Stock for which the Company relies on Section 8A(iii)(a) above, a statement of whether an effective registration statement exists and is available for resales of shares of Common Stock that are issued in respect of the Make-Whole Premium payment; and
(c) with respect to delivery of shares of Common Stock for which the Company relies on Section 8A(iii)(b) above:
(1) a statement as to whether the Company is in compliance and will be in compliance with Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act on the date of payment of the Make-Whole Premium in the form of Common Stock;
(2) the relevant text of Rule 144(e) under the Securities Act regarding the calculation methods of volume limitations;
(3) a statement that investors must make their own determination as to whether they are entitled to rely on Rule 144 under the Securities Act in respect of resales of shares of Common Stock that are issued as payment for the Make-Whole Premium; and
(4) a statement that investors may be required to make certain filings with the SEC and other regulatory authorities in relation to any resales of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
(v) The Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional interests in any security, or other property delivered in connection with a Fundamental Change. The Make-Whole Premium shall be payable on the 35th Trading Day following the Effective Date for Series B Preferred Stock converted in connection with a Fundamental Change.
(vi) The Stock Price paid, or deemed paid, per share of Common Stock in the transaction constituting the Fundamental Change will be as follows:
(a) if the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory approval rights) for the Common Stock consists solely of cash, 100% of the cash amount paid per share for such Common Stock; and
(b) in all other cases, the average of the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Effective Date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(vii) The value of Common Stock for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in respect of the Make-Whole Premium will be the Stock Price, as calculated pursuant to Section 8(A)(vi), multiplied by 95%.
(viii) The following table sets forth the Stock Price paid, or deemed paid, per share of Common Stock in the transaction constituting a Fundamental Change as described in paragraph (b) of the definition thereof, the Effective Date and Make-Whole Premium (expressed as a percentage of the Liquidation Preference) upon a conversion in connection with such a Fundamental Change:
Value as % of Liquidation Preference
 
The Stock Prices set forth in the table will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Price of the Series B Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant an adjustment to the Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 7 hereof. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to the adjustment divided by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Price immediately prior to the adjustment to the Conversion Price and the denominator of which is the Conversion Price as so adjusted.
The exact Stock Price and Effective Date may not be set forth in the table, in which case:
(a) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Make-Whole Premium will be determined by straight-line interpolation between Make-Whole Premium amounts set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) if the Stock Price is in excess of $55.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price) the payment corresponding to row $55.00 will be paid; and
(c) if the Stock Price is less than $10.51 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price), no Make-Whole Premium will be paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion under Section 8A exceed 95.1475 shares of Common Stock per Liquidation Preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7 hereof.
Section 9.
Conversion After a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change
.
(i) In the event of a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, the Company may, in lieu of paying the Make-Whole Premium described in Section 8A hereof, elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and related conversion obligation such that, from and after the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, the Holders who elect to convert shall be entitled to convert their shares of Series B Preferred Stock into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock that have been registered, or the resale of which will be registered, under the Securities Act, by adjusting the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Fundamental Change by a fraction:
(a) the numerator of which shall be (i) in the case of a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property, the Fair Market Value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be conclusive) paid or payable per share of Common Stock or (ii) in the case of any other Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, the average of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change; and
(b) the denominator of which shall be the average of the Closing Sale Price of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change.
(ii) The Company shall state, in the notice of a Fundamental Change required to be issued pursuant to Section 8(iii), whether it has elected to adjust the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9(i), rather than pay the Make-Whole Premium pursuant to Section 8A(i). With respect to each Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, the Company shall make only one election, and the Company shall not change that election once it has first mailed any such notice or made any such public announcement or publication. However, if the Company elects to change the conversion right in connection with a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change as
 
 
 
 
 
described in this Section 9 and that such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change ultimately is not consummated, then the Company shall not be obligated to give effect to that particular election.
Section 10.
Registration Procedures
.
(i) In the event the Company elects to make a dividend or Make-Whole Premium payment on the Series B Preferred Stock by delivery of Common Stock (the "Registrable Securities") in reliance on Section 2A(iv)(a) or Section 8A(iii)(a) hereof, the Company shall, subject to Section 10(ii) hereof, use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the related registration statement (the "Resale Registration Statement"):
(a) in the case of a payment of a dividend by delivery of Common Stock in reliance on Section 2A(iv)(a), for ten (10) consecutive days immediately following the time of delivery of such shares; and
(b) in the case of a payment of a Make-Whole Premium by delivery of Common Stock in reliance on Section 8A(iii)(a) hereof, for 45 days immediately following the time of delivery of such shares,
provided
that the Company shall have the right to defer the availability of the Resale Registration Statement pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sections 10(ii)(a)(2) and 10(ii)(c) hereof for a maximum of 21 days in the aggregate, commencing on or after the 22nd day after the time of delivery of shares of Common Stock.
(ii) If the Company has filed a Resale Registration Statement and such Resale Registration Statement has become effective, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) Each Holder of Registrable Securities that wishes to sell its Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement must give written notice to the Company at least two Business Days prior to any intended resale of Registrable Securities under the Resale Registration Statement, which notice shall specify the date on which such Holder intends to begin such distribution and such information with respect to such Holder and the intended distribution as may be reasonably required to amend the Resale Registration Statement or supplement the prospectus included therein with respect to such intended distribution (each Holder providing the notice described in this sentence and with respect to which the related Selling Period is continuing or has been deferred, a "Notice Holder" each such notice, a "Selling Notice"). As soon as practicable after receipt of a Selling Notice by the Company, and in any event within two Business Days after such date, the Company shall either (1) provide a Selling Confirmation to such Notice Holder or (2) subject to Section 10(ii)(b), deliver a notice to such Notice Holder containing an instruction to defer the use by the Holder of the prospectus included in the Resale Registration Statement until the Company delivers a Selling Confirmation (such notice, a "Deferral Notice"), whereupon the Selling Period shall be deferred and shall commence upon the delivery of the aforementioned Selling Confirmation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) The Company shall issue a Deferral Notice pursuant to Section 10(ii)(a) only if:
(1) a Deferral Event has occurred and is continuing;
(2) the Selling Notice received by the Company relates to shares of Common Stock delivered in reliance on Section 8A(iii)(a) hereof; and
(3) the distribution of the shares of Common Stock to which the Selling Notice relates is intended to begin on or after the 22nd day after the time of delivery of such shares to the Notice Holder by the Company.
(c)
With respect to shares of Common Stock delivered in reliance on Section 8A(iii)(a) hereof, in the event a Deferral Event occurs during any existing Selling Period, the Company may elect to deliver a Deferral Notice to the relevant Holders, whereupon such Selling Period or Selling Periods shall be deferred until such later date as the Company delivers a Selling Confirmation (such period, the "Deferral Period");
provided
that
deferrals may not exceed 21 days in the aggregate.
(d) A Notice Holder may sell all or any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein only during its Selling Period, and a Notice Holder shall not sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein during a Deferral Period or after the expiration of such Selling Period.
(e) If, notwithstanding the Company's use of its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement in accordance with Section 10(i) hereof, the Resale Registration Statement ceases to be effective, the Company shall notify all Notice Holders thereof and upon receipt of such notice, such Notice Holders shall cease use of the Resale Registration Statement until such Notice Holders have received a subsequent Selling Confirmation from the Company.
Section 11.
Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes in the Company's Stock
.
(i) In the event of any reclassification of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or any consolidation or merger of the Company (other than with a Subsidiary of a Company) with or into another Person or any merger of another Person with or into the Company (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the resulting or surviving Person and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding Common Stock), or any sale or other disposition to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (computed on a consolidated basis) (any of the foregoing, a
 
 
 
 
 
"Transaction"), upon conversion of its shares of Series B Preferred Stock, a Holder will be entitled to receive the kind and amount of securities (of the Company or another issuer), cash and other property receivable upon such Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock was convertible into immediately prior to such Transaction, after giving effect to any adjustment event (the "reference property"). At and after the Effective Date of such Transaction, the Conversion Rate will be calculated based on the Fair Market Value of the reference property. The provisions of this Section 11(i) and any equivalent thereof in any such securities similarly shall apply to successive Transactions.
(ii) In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in any Transaction, the Company shall make adequate provision whereby the Holders shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the Series B Preferred Stock, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the effective date of such Transaction. The determination: (a) will be made by Holders representing a plurality of shares of Series B Preferred Stock participating in such determination, (b) will be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common Stock are subject, including, but not limited to, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Transaction and (c) will be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earlier of: (1) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock, and (2) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of such Transaction.
(iii) This provision does not limit the rights of Holders or of the Company in the event of a Fundamental Change, including a Holder's right to receive a Make-Whole Premium in connection with a conversion or the ability of the Company to elect to adjust the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9 hereof.
Section 12.
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
.
(i) The Company, without the consent of the Holders, may consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or may permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties to, the Company;
provided, however
, that (a) the successor, transferee or lessee is organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; (b) the shares of Series B Preferred Stock will become shares of such successor, transferee or lessee, having in respect of such successor, transferee or lessee the same powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualification, limitations or restrictions thereon, the Series B Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; and (c) the Company delivers to the Transfer Agent an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, acceptable to the Transfer Agent, stating that such transaction complies with this Certificate of Designations.
(ii) Upon any consolidation by the Company with, or merger by the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company as described in Section 12(i) hereof, the successor resulting from such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the transferee or lessee to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made, will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and
 
 
 
 
 
thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor (if still in existence) will be released from its obligations and covenants with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock. Nothing in this Section 12 limits the rights of Holders set out in Section 8 and Section 8A hereof.
Section 13.
SEC Reports
.
During the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Issue Date, if the Company shall have failed to file any annual reports on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC within 15 days after the deadline prescribed under the Exchange Act or the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder for the filing of such report, the Dividend Rate shall increase by one percentage point (100 basis points) for the period beginning on and including the 16th day after the applicable deadline and ending on but excluding the day on which all such reports have been filed with the SEC and shall thereafter decrease by one percentage point (100 basis points) beginning on and including the day on which all such reports have been filed with the SEC.
Section 14.
Notices
.
(i) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders by issuing a press release, rather than directly to holders, the Company shall do so in a public medium that is customary for such press release;
provided, however
, that in such cases, publication of a press release through the Dow Jones News Service shall be considered sufficient to comply with such notice obligation.
(ii) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders without specifying the method of giving such notice, the Company shall do so by sending notice via first class mail or by overnight courier to the Holders of record as of a reasonably current date or by publication, as provided in Section 14(iii) hereof.
(iii) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice by publication, the Company shall do so by publishing a notice in the national edition of
The Wall Street Journal
,
The New York Times
or a newspaper of national circulation chosen in good faith by the Company.
(iv) When the Company is required to give notice herein to any Holder within a specified number of Trading Days prior to a specified event, the Company will identify such Trading Days in good faith based on its reasonable expectations for the application of the definition of "Trading Days" set forth herein. Any notice issued in reliance on such identification will satisfy the Company's obligation with respect to the timing of such notice, notwithstanding any subsequent events that may cause such days to fail to be Trading Days.
Section 15.

This will allow us to focus on operational and strategic issues going forward."
