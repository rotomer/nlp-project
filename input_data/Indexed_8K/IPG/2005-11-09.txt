AND YEAR TO DATE RESULTS
 
Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Organic revenue performance for the first nine months of 2005 was flat and we expect a modest decline for the full year. We have taken steps to improve our growth prospects by making management changes and upgrades at a number of key operating units," said Michael I. Roth, Chairman and CEO of Interpublic. "However, client losses that took place during the past 12 months will continue to affect our comparative results over the next few quarters."
 
Mr. Roth added, "We continued to see the very high level of professional fees that we have been incurring throughout this year. These are a necessary investment to remediate the company's financial control environment and build effective shared services solutions. Those levels of spending should step down substantially in 2006 and then again in 2007. Improving organic growth and improving margins will be our top priorities as we head into the new year."
 
 
Third Quarter 2005 Operating Results
 
Revenue
Revenue decreased 5.1% in the third quarter of 2005 to $1.44 billion, compared with the year-ago period. This reflects a benefit of foreign currency translation of 0.9%, net divestitures of 3.3% and organic decline in revenue of 2.6%. The organic revenue change was due to two major factors: client losses and deferrals of revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to application of new revenue recognition policies, which the company implemented as part of its recent restatement.
 
In the United States, reported revenue declined 5.5%, including an organic decrease of 5.0%, compared to the third quarter in 2004. Non-U.S. reported revenue decreased 4.4% in the third quarter of 2005 compared to 2004. Currency effect was 2.1%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 7.0% and the resulting organic revenue growth was 0.5%.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Operating Expenses
During the third quarter of 2005, salary and related expense was $963.8 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to the same period in 2004. Adjusted for currency and the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures, salary and related expenses increased 4.1%. This increase reflects hiring of global finance staff to improve the accounting and control environment, shared services personnel, as well as increased headcount at certain units to support revenue gains. Additionally, higher severance expense also contributed to this increase, but was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.
 
Compared to the same period in 2004, third quarter 2005 office and general expense increased 3.4% to $575.4 million. Adjusted for currency and the effect of net divestitures, office and general expenses increased 10.0%. This increase reflects a significant increase in professional fees related to the restatement process and shared services initiatives.
 
Non-Operating and Tax
Benefit for income taxes in the third quarter of 2005 was $29.9 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of $130.0 million in the same period of 2004. The company's tax rate in both periods was adversely affected by losses incurred in non-U.S. jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than U.S. statutory rates or no tax benefit to the company.
 
Balance Sheet
At September 30, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.35 billion, compared to $1.46 billion at the same point in 2004. At the end of the third quarter of 2005, total debt was $2.3 billion, the same level as at September 30, 2004. In keeping with its stated commitment to a conservative approach to financial management, after the end of this year's third quarter, the company completed an offering of $525 million of convertible preferred stock. The company's debt maturity schedule provides it with significant financial flexibility, as no maturities are due until 2008.
 
 
 
 
Year-to-Date 2005 Operating Results
 
Revenue
Compared with the first nine months of 2004, revenue decreased 0.7% in 2005 to $4.39 billion. This reflects a 1.2% benefit of foreign currency translation, offset by net divestitures of 1.9% and organic change in revenue that was essentially flat compared to 2004.
 
For 2005, reported revenue in the United States decreased 1.6%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 0.5% and the resulting organic decline in revenue was 1.1% compared to 2004. Non-U.S. reported revenue increased 0.4% in 2005 year to date compared to the same period in 2004. Currency effect was 2.8%, net divestitures had a negative impact of 3.7% and the resulting organic growth in revenue was 1.4%.
 
Operating Expenses

Adjusted for currency and the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures, salary and related expenses increased 6.6%. The increase reflects the hiring of global finance staff to improve the accounting and control environment, shared services personnel, as well as increased headcount at certain units to support new business.
 
Compared to 2004, office and general expense year-to-date in 2005 increased 1.3% to $1.64 billion. Adjusted for currency and the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures, office and general expenses increased 4.7%, reflecting a significant increase in professional fees related to the restatement process and shared services initiatives.
