On March 22, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. ("Interpublic") established the performance objectives that will be used to determine 2006 management incentive compensation awards ("MICP Awards") payable in 2007 to the named executive officers of Interpublic under Interpublic's 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (filed as Appendix B to Interpublic's 2004 proxy statement on April 23, 2004 and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10(iii)(A)(1) to Interpublic's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, filed on August 9, 2004) (the "2004 PIP").
Pursuant to the 2004 PIP, the Committee is authorized to grant MICP Awards based on the achievement of performance objectives relating to one or more of the "Performance Criteria" (as defined in the 2004 PIP). The Committee has determined that the applicable Performance Criteria for 2006 will be operating income before impairments, litigation settlements and other non-operating items for the 2006 fiscal year. Depending on actual performance in 2006, an executive officer's 2006 MICP Award could range from zero to 200% of his or her target bonus. The Committee will determine the form and timing of MICP Awards based on the Committee's judgment regarding Interpublic's and the executive officer's performance in 2006 against the performance objectives. As contemplated by the 2004 PIP, in no event will any executive officer's MICP Award exceed $5,000,000.
