This Current Report on Form 8-K/A corrects an error in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 29, 2006 (the "March 29 Form 8-K"), by The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company"). The March 29 Form 8-K incorrectly indicated that Mr. Goldstein's election as Presiding Director was effective immediately. The report should have stated that Mr. Goldstein's election as Presiding Director by the Company's Board of Directors would be effective immediately after the next meeting of the Company's shareholders, expected to be held in May 2006.
 
On March 29, 2006, the Company issued a press release reflecting this correction, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
In addition, the press release originally filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the March 29 Form 8-K incorrectly indicated that Mr. Goldstein had been a director of the Company since 1995. In fact, Mr. Goldstein's service as director commenced in 2001.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
INTERPUBLIC CLARIFIES EARLIER ANNOUNCEMENT
 
New York, NY (March 29, 2006)  Frank Borelli, the current Presiding Director of Interpublic (NYSE: IPG), will be leaving this position at the 2006 shareholder meeting in May, when his term concludes. At that point, Richard Goldstein will commence as the new Presiding Director of the Company. This move is not immediate, as previously implied.
 
"At Interpublic's annual meeting, Frank will be completing his term as Presiding Director. We have been fortunate to have him available to serve in this capacity during these challenging times. And we thank him for his dedication and his continued service," said Michael Roth. Frank Borelli added, "The timing for this change could not be better. Interpublic is entering another stage in its turnaround, and the annual meeting, when my term ends, presents a great opportunity for Dick with his many skills and years of experience to step in and help Interpublic return to a preeminent position in the media and marketing services industry."
 
As previously noted, Mr. Borelli will continue to serve as a Director of the Company.
