INTERPUBLIC WILL BRING TOGETHER FCB AND DRAFT UNITS
 
New Organization Will Deliver Full Range of Creative, Integrated and Accountable Marketing Programs
Howard Draft to Lead Combined Operations
 
New York, NY (June 1, 2006)  The Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) announced today that it will bring its Draft and FCB units together to create a global integrated marketing organization with a single management team and P&L. Draft FCB Group, the new entity that will emerge, represents a communications model designed to address the needs of clients in today's dynamic, consumer-driven marketing environment.
 
"Clients are increasingly looking to us to deliver more personalized, creative and accountable communications programs, with best-in-class capabilities across the marketing spectrum," said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO. "Steve Blamer and Howard Draft each came forward to propose linking these two strong companies with highly complementary capabilities. We carefully considered the potential of a combination and believe that the resulting organization will be highly responsive to the new realities that are transforming the consumer and media landscape. There is still a great deal of work to be done by the full leadership teams of both companies to develop a comprehensive plan and definitive timeline for integration. We are, however, all of one mind  the resulting agency will be uniquely positioned to deliver marketing programs that connect with consumers through powerful creative ideas that drive measurable ROI."
 
"We're confident that Howard and the management team he assembles can create a world-class organization," adds Mr. Roth. "During his time at FCB, Steve has streamlined the FCB operation and put the company on firm ground. He has also made great strides in moving the company to a more holistic and contemporary offering.
 
 
 
 
Having helped turbo-charge this process by means of a combination with Draft, he has decided to move on to other challenges. We appreciate Steve's leadership and the selfless role he played in making a great strategic idea into a reality."
 
Effective immediately, Howard Draft, 52, has been named Chairman and CEO of the joint Draft and FCB operations. After a transitional period, Steve Blamer, 50, will be leaving FCB and Interpublic. FCB's Jonathan Harries, 53, has been named Worldwide Chief Creative Officer for the new company.
 
Integration teams are being formed with equal representation from both companies to develop plans for integrating key areas such as geographic market alignment, professional competencies and capabilities (business development, creative services, research, strategic planning, media), human resources and communications, as well as finance and operations. These teams will report to an Integration Committee led by Draft's Laurence Boschetto and Mr. Harries. It is expected that the work of the Integration Committee will be completed in approximately 90 days, at which time the new agency's organizational and management structure will be announced. Full implementation of the merger will begin at that point and last for six to twelve months. As with any merger, the company expects that there will be certain related costs. Although this is not a cost-driven combination, the integration teams will also be examining potential cost savings.
 
The Integration Committee will report to Mr. Draft and meet regularly with a Transition Board made up of Mr. Draft and Interpublic's EVP, CFO Frank Mergenthaler and its EVP, Strategy, Philippe Krakowsky. Independent or separately-branded units currently grouped with either FCB or Draft, which include FCB
i
, Marketing Drive, R/GA and Zipatoni will continue to operate independently, serving their existing client rosters and collaborating across Interpublic.
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Bringing together FCB and Draft, two strong and highly complementary organizations, positions us perfectly to address evolving client demand," said Mr. Draft. "Unlike other models, in which one discipline dominates, our approach has the revolutionary potential of being grounded in creativity, fueled by insights into consumer behavior. This strategy  and the joint contributions of Draft and FCB to developing it  will be the cornerstone of our new company."
 
"In making this recommendation to Michael several months ago, I firmly believed that this merger would give FCB the shot in the arm the agency needs to reach new heights," said Mr. Blamer. "It's about creating a powerful offering that will allow clients to get precisely the resources they want."
 
Post-integration, the new organization will have a pioneering go-to-market strategy; at the same time, it will maintain the core competencies that existing clients chose in making the decision to work with Draft or FCB. Clients satisfied with their current relationships with either brand will, of course, have the option of not engaging the new combined offering. Despite the flexibility that the new organization will provide clients and the extended period before full integration, the possibility of certain client conflicts cannot be ruled out. The management of both agencies has and will continue to communicate regularly with all clients as it relates to the benefits of the merger.
 
FCB brings excellence in the critical areas of branding, creative, digital and media planning and particular strength in India and Brazil, two key growth markets. Draft is known for its outstanding work in behavioral strategic development and the creation of profitable customer experiences through data and CRM, retail and promotions, accountability and ROI discipline. The merged company will offer services in brand advertising development, CRM, interactive marketing, promotions, retail, healthcare (professional, DTC and OTC), as well as media capabilities in direct TV, interactive and mass communications.
