On June 6, 2006, the Company entered into a capped call option agreement (together, the "
Agreements
") with each of four derivatives dealers (the "
Banks
"). Copies of the Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.01.
The Agreements were entered into in connection with a capital markets transaction that will provide the Company with a new source of committed stand-by liquidity and a new letter of credit facility (the "
ELF Financing
"). The ELF Financing was priced on June 6, 2006 and is expected to close on June 13, 2006. The Agreements provide that they will be unwound if the closing of the ELF Financing does not occur by June 13, 2006. In the ELF Financing, a special-purpose entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd. has agreed with a group of initial purchasers to sell units consisting of notes linked to the credit of the Company and warrants to purchase common stock of the Company. At closing, ELF will provide the Company with a $750 million revolving stand-by credit facility under which the Company can receive advances and cause letters of credit to be issued.
As part of the ELF Financing, the Company will issue 38,826,875 uncapped warrants (the "
Uncapped Warrants
"), with an exercise price of $11.91 per warrant. (The Company will also issue capped warrants in the ELF Financing, and the Agreements do not relate to these capped warrants.) Each Uncapped Warrant will entitle the holder to receive, following expiration of the warrant on June 15, 2009, an amount in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, at the Company's option. The amount will be based, subject to customary adjustments, on the difference between the market price of one share of the Company's common stock (over 30 trading days following expiration) and the stated exercise price of the warrant.
The Agreements are intended to reduce the potential dilution of the Company's common stock upon the exercise of the Uncapped Warrants.
Each Agreement gives the Company the right to receive, upon expiration of the options thereunder, an amount in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, at the Company's option. The amount will be based, subject to customary adjustments, on the difference between the market price of one share of the Company's common stock (over 30 trading days following expiration) and $11.91, the exercise price of the Uncapped Warrants, with the amount deliverable upon exercise capped so the Company will not receive any amount relating to appreciation of its common stock above $14.38 per share. The four Agreements cover an aggregate notional amount of 38,826,875 shares, equivalent to the full amount of the Uncapped Warrants. The aggregate cost of the four Agreements to the Company will be approximately $29 million, payable upon closing of the ELF Transaction.

Opening Transaction  Call
 
Re: Capped Call Transaction
Reference: Bank to provide.
Dear Sir/Madam:
The purpose of this letter agreement (this "
Confirmation
") is to confirm the terms and conditions of the Transaction entered into between Citibank, N.A. ("
Bank
") and you ("
Counterparty
") on the Trade Date specified below (the "
Transaction
"). This Confirmation constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below. This Confirmation shall replace any previous letter and serve as the final documentation for this Transaction. The Transaction is subject to early unwind if the closing of the Units offering consisting of Warrants issued by Counterparty and Floating Rate Credit Linked Notes issued by ELF Special Financing Ltd. due June 15, 2009 (the "
Units
") is not consummated for any reason, as set forth below in Section 9(i). "
Warrant Agreement
" means the Warrant Agreement, to be dated as of the Effective Date, between Counterparty and the Warrant Agent named therein, and shall not reflect any amendment, modification, supplement or waiver thereto following the issuance of the Units. Counterparty shall provide Bank with a copy of the executed Warrant Agreement on the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, references herein to provisions of the Warrant Agreement are based on the description of the Warrant Agreement set forth in the Offering Memorandum of Counterparty and ELF Special Financing Ltd., dated as of June 6, 2006, in respect of $712,500,000 in the aggregate of Floating Rate Convertible Series A Units due 2009 and Floating Rate Convertible Series B Units due 2009 (the "
Offering Memorandum
"). If any relevant provisions of the Warrant Agreement differ in any material respect from those described in the Offering Memorandum, the parties will amend this Confirmation in good faith to preserve the economic intent of the parties.
This Confirmation is subject to, and incorporates, the definitions and provisions of the 2000 ISDA Definitions (including the Annex thereto) (the "
2000 Definitions
") and the definitions and provisions of the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "
Equity Definitions
", and together with the 2000 Definitions, the "
Definitions
"), in each case as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("
ISDA
"). In the event of any inconsistency between the 2000 Definitions and the Equity Definitions, the Equity Definitions will govern.
Each party is hereby advised, and each such party acknowledges, that the other party has engaged in, or refrained from engaging in, substantial financial transactions and has taken other material actions in reliance upon the parties' entry into the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates on the terms and conditions set forth below.

ISDA Form
") as if Bank and Counterparty had executed an agreement in such form (without any Schedule except for the election of "Second Method" and "Loss" for purposes of Section 6(e) of the Agreement and any other elections set forth in this Confirmation). For the avoidance of doubt, the Transaction shall be the only transaction under the Agreement.
All provisions contained in, or incorporated by reference to, the Agreement will govern this Confirmation except as expressly modified herein. In the event of any inconsistency between this Confirmation and either the Definitions or the Agreement, this Confirmation shall govern.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
 
 
 
(f)

(g)           
Transfer or Assignment
. Bank may transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any of its Affiliates with the consent of Counterparty, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (i) (A) if Bank has a Credit Support Provider, Counterparty shall have received a duly executed full unconditional guarantee by Bank's Credit Support Provider, in favor of Counterparty, of the obligations of such Affiliate substantially in the form of the guarantee provided by Bank's Credit Support Provider hereunder, or (B) if Bank does not have a Credit Support Provider, the creditworthiness of such Affiliate is satisfactory to Counterparty, and (ii) such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions.

Beneficial Ownership Percentage
") exceeds 8% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares and (y) in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, Bank reasonably determines that it would be inadvisable for it or its Affiliates to engage in alternative hedging transactions which would enable them to reduce the Beneficial Ownership Percentage other than by transfer, assignment or termination, then Bank, in its discretion, (i) shall have the right to transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party, so long as such third party has a long-term credit rating equal to or better than A1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and A+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or their respective successors (or is guaranteed by a party that satisfies this condition) and such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions, and (ii) if Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage is reduced to 8% or less, Bank may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "
Terminated Portion
") of the Transaction, such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage following such partial termination will be approximately equal to 8%. In the event that Bank so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of the Transaction, a payment or delivery shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to the Terminated Portion of the Transaction, (ii) Counterparty shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of the Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction.
"" means that: (i) Counterparty shall have received a duly executed acceptance and assumption by the transferee of the obligations under this Transaction in a form satisfactory to Counterparty; (ii) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, be required to pay the transferee on any payment date an amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than an amount in respect of which Counterparty would have been required to pay to Bank in the absence of the transfer and (B) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, receive from the transferee on any payment date an amount (after taking into account any additional amount payable under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement) less than the amount which Counterparty would have received from Bank in the absence of such transfer as a result of any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax (as such ter m is defined in the Agreement) under Section 2(d)(i); and (iii) an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event will not occur as a result of the transfer.
Transfer Conditions
(h)           
Staggered Settlement
. Bank may, if Net Share Settlement is applicable, by notice to Counterparty prior to the Settlement Date (the "
Nominal Settlement Date
"), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a "
Staggered Settlement Date
") or at two or more times on the Nominal Settlement Date as follows:
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
 
 
 
 
(i)         in such notice, Bank will specify to Counterparty the related Staggered Settlement Dates (each of which will be on or prior to such Nominal Settlement Date) or delivery times and how it will allocate the Shares it is required to deliver under "Net Share Settlement" (above) among the Staggered Settlement Dates or delivery times; and
(ii)          the aggregate number of Shares that Bank will deliver to Counterparty hereunder on all such Staggered Settlement Dates and delivery times will equal the number of Shares that Bank would otherwise be required to deliver on such Nominal Settlement Date.
(i)            
Early Unwind
. In the event the sale by Counterparty of the Units is not consummated with the initial purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for any reason by the close of business in New York on June 13, 2006 (or such later date as agreed upon by the parties, which in no event shall be later than the date specified for this purpose in the Purchase Agreement) (June 13, 2006 or such later date being the "
Early Unwind Date
"), the Transaction shall automatically terminate (the "
Early Unwind
") on the Early Unwind Date and (i) the Transaction and all of the respective rights and obligations of Bank and Counterparty thereunder shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii) if the failure to consummate the sale of the Units results from a breach by Counterparty of any representation of or any undertaking by Counterparty contained in the Purchase Agreement, Counterparty shall pay to Bank an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses relating to the unwinding of Bank's reasonable hedging activities in respect of the Transaction (including market losses incurred in reselling any Shares purchased by Bank or its affiliates in connection with such reasonable hedging activities). Following such termination, cancellation and payment, each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or liabilities of either party arising out of and to be performed in connection with the Transaction either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date. The amount of any such reimbursement shall be determined by Bank in its reasonable good faith discretion. Bank shall notify the Company of such amount, including, upon Counterparty's request, an explanation of the basis of determination of such amount, and Counterparty shall pay such amount in immediately available funds on the Early Unwind Date. Bank and Counterparty represent and acknowledge to the other that upon an Early Unwind and following the payment referred to above, all obligations with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed fully and finally discharged. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9(i) shall become effective as of the Trade Date and shall remain in effect whether or not the Effective Date of the Transaction occurs.
(j)            
Designation of Agent
. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing the Bank to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, the Bank may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Bank's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. The Bank shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty to the extent of any such performance.
(k)           
Disclosure
. Effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transaction, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
 
 
 
(l)            
Setoff
. Except as provided in this Section 9(l), obligations under this Transaction shall not be set off by Bank against any other obligations of Counterparty, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, Bank shall have the right to set off any obligation that it may have to Counterparty under this Confirmation, including without limitation any obligation to make any payment of cash or delivery of Shares to Counterparty, against any obligation Counterparty may have to Bank under any other agreement between Bank and Counterparty relating to Shares (each such contract or agreement, a "
Separate Agreement
"), including without limitation any obligation to make a payment of cash or a delivery of Shares or any other property or securities. For this purpose, Bank shall be entitled to convert any obligation (or the relevant portion of such obligation) denominated in one currency into another currency at the rate of exchange at which it would be able to purchase the relevant amount of such currency, and to convert any obligation to deliver any non-cash property into an obligation to deliver cash in an amount calculated by reference to the market value of such property as of the Early Termination Date, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
that in the case of a set-off of any obligation to release or deliver assets against any right to receive fungible assets, such obligation and right shall be set off in kind; and
provided further
that in determining the value of any obligation to deliver Shares, the value at any time of such obligation shall be determined by reference to the market value of the Shares at such time, as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent. If an obligation is unascertained at the time of any such set-off, the Calculation Agent may in good faith estimate the amount or value of such obligation, in which case set-off will be effected in respect of that estimate, and the relevant party shall account to the other party at the time such obligation or right is ascertained.
(m)          
Securities Contract; Swap Agreement
. Each of Bank and Counterparty agrees and acknowledges that Bank is a "swap participant" and "financial participant" within the meaning of Sections 101(22), 101(53C) and 101(22A) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "
Bankruptcy Code
"). The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge (A) that this Confirmation is (i) a "securities contract," as such term is defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "settlement payment," as such term is defined in Section 741(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) a "swap agreement," as such term is defined in Section 101(53B) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "transfer," as such term is defined in Section 101(54) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (B) that Bank is entitled to the protections afforded by, among other sections, Section 362(b)(6), 362(b)(17), 546(e), 546(g), 555 and 560 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(n)          
Governing Law
. New York law.
(o)          
Waiver of Jury Trial
. Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Transaction. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such a suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Transaction, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications provided herein.
(p)           
Right to Extend
. Bank may postpone any date of delivery by Bank, with respect to some or all of the Options, if Bank reasonably determines that such extension is reasonably necessary to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Bank were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
(q)           
Registration
. Counterparty hereby agrees that if, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, the Shares
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
 
(the "
Hedge Shares
") acquired by Bank for the purpose of hedging its obligations pursuant to the Transaction cannot be sold in the U.S. public market by Bank without registration under the Securities Act, Counterparty shall, at its election: (i) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a registered offering, make available to Bank an effective registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the resale of such Hedge Shares and (A) enter into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, substantially in the form of an underwriting agreement for a registered offering, (B) provide accountant's "comfort" letters in customary form for registered offerings of equity securities, (C) provide disclosure opinions of nationally recognized outside counsel to Counterparty reasonably acceptable to Bank, (D) provide other customary opinions, certificates and closing documents customary in form for registered offerings of equity securities and (E) afford Bank a reasonable opportunity to conduct a "due diligence" investigation with respect to Counterparty customary in scope for underwritten offerings of equity securities;
provided, however
, that if Bank, in its reasonable discretion, is not satisfied with access to due diligence materials, the results of its due diligence investigation, or the procedures and documentation for the registered offering referred to above, then clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 9(q) shall apply at the election of Counterparty; (ii) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a private placement, enter into a private placement agreement substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, including customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to Bank, due diligence rights (for Bank or any designated buyer of the Hedge Shares from Bank), opinions and certificates and such other documentation as is customary for private placements agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Bank (in which case, the Calculation Agent shall make any adjustments to the terms of the Transaction that are necessary, in its reasonable judgment, to compensate Bank for any discount from the public market price of the Shares incurred on the sale of Hedge Shares in a private placement); or (iii) purchase the Hedge Shares from Bank at the VWAP Price on such Exchange Business Days, and in the amounts, reasonably requested by Bank.
(r)            
Termination Currency

(s)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Confirmation or Section 12.7(b) of the Equity Definitions, in determining any amount payable in respect of a Cancellation and Payment, the value of this Transaction shall be determined based on the volatility, expected dividend yield and stock loan rate of the Shares assuming that no Fundamental Change had occurred or been announced. If any amount is payable by Bank to Counterparty in connection with such a Cancellation and Payment, Counterparty may elect for such payment to be satisfied by the delivery one Settlement Cycle following the 30 Trading Day referred to in clause (ii) below of a number of Shares equal to (i) the amount payable in connection with the Cancellation and Payment
th
divided

Limit on Beneficial Ownership
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this Confirmation, in no event shall Bank be entitled to receive, or be deemed to receive, any Shares to the extent (but only to the extent) that receipt of such Shares by Bank would result in Bank's "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) being equal to or greater than 9.0% or more of the outstanding Shares. Any purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in Bank directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares. If any delivery owed to Bank hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Counterparty's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Counterparty shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Clearance System Business Day after, Bank gives notice to Counterparty that such delivery would not result in Bank directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares.

Counterparty shall provide Bank with a copy of the executed Warrant Agreement on the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, references herein to provisions of the Warrant Agreement are based on the description of the Warrant Agreement set forth in the Offering Memorandum of Counterparty and ELF Special Financing Ltd., dated as of June 6, 2006, in respect of $712,500,000 in the aggregate of Floating Rate Convertible Series A Units due 2009 and Floating Rate Convertible Series B Units due 2009 (the "

"). If any relevant provisions of the Warrant Agreement differ in any material respect from those described in the Offering Memorandum, the parties will amend this Confirmation in good faith to preserve the economic intent of the parties.
 
This Confirmation is subject to, and incorporates, the definitions and provisions of the 2000 ISDA Definitions (including the Annex thereto) (the "
2000 Definitions

(d)

CONFIDENTIAL TREAMTENT
 
 
 
(f)           
Board Authorization

(g)           
Transfer or Assignment
. Bank may transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any of its Affiliates with the consent of Counterparty, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (i) (A) if Bank has a Credit Support Provider, Counterparty shall have received a duly executed full unconditional guarantee by Bank's Credit Support Provider, in favor of Counterparty, of the obligations of such Affiliate substantially in the form of the guarantee provided by Bank's Credit Support Provider hereunder, or (B) if Bank does not have a Credit Support Provider, the creditworthiness of such Affiliate is satisfactory to Counterparty, and (ii) such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions.

Beneficial Ownership Percentage
") exceeds 8% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares and (y) in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, Bank reasonably determines that it would be inadvisable for it or its Affiliates to engage in alternative hedging transactions which would enable them to reduce the Beneficial Ownership Percentage other than by transfer, assignment or termination, then Bank, in its discretion, (i) shall have the right to transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party, so long as such third party has a long-term credit rating equal to or better than A1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and A+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or their respective successors (or is guaranteed by a party that satisfies this condition) and such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions, and (ii) if Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage is reduced to 8% or less, Bank may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "
Terminated Portion
") of the Transaction, such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage following such partial termination will be approximately equal to 8%. In the event that Bank so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of the Transaction, a payment or delivery shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to the Terminated Portion of the Transaction, (ii) Counterparty shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of the Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction.
"
Transfer Conditions
" means that: (i) Counterparty shall have received a duly executed acceptance and assumption by the transferee of the obligations under this Transaction in a form satisfactory to Counterparty; (ii) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, be required to pay the transferee on any payment date an amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than an amount in respect of which Counterparty would have been required to pay to Bank in the absence of the transfer and (B) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, receive from the transferee on any payment date an amount (after taking into account any additional amount payable under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement) less than the amount which Counterparty would have received from Bank in the absence of such transfer as a result of any deduction or withholding f or or on account of any Tax (as such term is defined in the Agreement) under Section 2(d)(i); and (iii) an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event will not occur as a result of the transfer.
(h)           
Staggered Settlement
. Bank may, if Net Share Settlement is applicable, by notice to Counterparty prior to the Settlement Date (the "
Nominal Settlement Date
"), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a "
Staggered Settlement Date
") or at two or more times on the Nominal Settlement Date as follows:
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREAMTENT
 
 
 
(i)         in such notice, Bank will specify to Counterparty the related Staggered Settlement Dates (each of which will be on or prior to such Nominal Settlement Date) or delivery times and how it will allocate the Shares it is required to deliver under "Net Share Settlement" (above) among the Staggered Settlement Dates or delivery times; and
(ii)          the aggregate number of Shares that Bank will deliver to Counterparty hereunder on all such Staggered Settlement Dates and delivery times will equal the number of Shares that Bank would otherwise be required to deliver on such Nominal Settlement Date.
(i)            
Early Unwind
. In the event the sale by Counterparty of the Units is not consummated with the initial purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for any reason by the close of business in New York on June 13, 2006 (or such later date as agreed upon by the parties, which in no event shall be later than the date specified for this purpose in the Purchase Agreement) (June 13, 2006 or such later date being the "
Early Unwind Date
"), the Transaction shall automatically terminate (the "
Early Unwind
") on the Early Unwind Date and (i) the Transaction and all of the respective rights and obligations of Bank and Counterparty thereunder shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii) if the failure to consummate the sale of the Units results from a breach by Counterparty of any representation of or any undertaking by Counterparty contained in the Purchase Agreement, Counterparty shall pay to Bank an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses relating to the unwinding of Bank's reasonable hedging activities in respect of the Transaction (including market losses incurred in reselling any Shares purchased by Bank or its affiliates in connection with such reasonable hedging activities). Following such termination, cancellation and payment, each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or liabilities of either party arising out of and to be performed in connection with the Transaction either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date. The amount of any such reimbursement shall be determined by Bank in its reasonable good faith discretion. Bank shall notify the Company of such amount, including, upon Counterparty's request, an explanation of the basis of determination of such amount, and Counterparty shall pay such amount in immediately available funds on the Early Unwind Date. Bank and Counterparty represent and acknowledge to the other that upon an Early Unwind and following the payment referred to above, all obligations with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed fully and finally discharged. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9(i) shall become effective as of the Trade Date and shall remain in effect whether or not the Effective Date of the Transaction occurs.
(j)            
Designation of Agent
. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing the Bank to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, the Bank may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Bank's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. The Bank shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty to the extent of any such performance.
(k)          
Disclosure
. Effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transaction, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREAMTENT
 
 
(l)            
Setoff
. Except as provided in this Section 9(l), obligations under this Transaction shall not be set off by Bank against any other obligations of Counterparty, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, Bank shall have the right to set off any obligation that it may have to Counterparty under this Confirmation, including without limitation any obligation to make any payment of cash or delivery of Shares to Counterparty, against any obligation Counterparty may have to Bank under any other agreement between Bank and Counterparty relating to Shares (each such contract or agreement, a "
Separate Agreement
"), including without limitation any obligation to make a payment of cash or a delivery of Shares or any other property or securities. For this purpose, Bank shall be entitled to convert any obligation (or the relevant portion of such obligation) denominated in one currency into another currency at the rate of exchange at which it would be able to purchase the relevant amount of such currency, and to convert any obligation to deliver any non-cash property into an obligation to deliver cash in an amount calculated by reference to the market value of such property as of the Early Termination Date, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
that in the case of a set-off of any obligation to release or deliver assets against any right to receive fungible assets, such obligation and right shall be set off in kind; and
provided further
that in determining the value of any obligation to deliver Shares, the value at any time of such obligation shall be determined by reference to the market value of the Shares at such time, as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent. If an obligation is unascertained at the time of any such set-off, the Calculation Agent may in good faith estimate the amount or value of such obligation, in which case set-off will be effected in respect of that estimate, and the relevant party shall account to the other party at the time such obligation or right is ascertained.
(m)          
Securities Contract; Swap Agreement
. Each of Bank and Counterparty agrees and acknowledges that Bank is a "swap participant" and "financial participant" within the meaning of Sections 101(22), 101(53C) and 101(22A) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "
Bankruptcy Code
"). The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge (A) that this Confirmation is (i) a "securities contract," as such term is defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "settlement payment," as such term is defined in Section 741(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) a "swap agreement," as such term is defined in Section 101(53B) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "transfer," as such term is defined in Section 101(54) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (B) that Bank is entitled to the protections afforded by, among other sections, Section 362(b)(6), 362(b)(17), 546(e), 546(g), 555 and 560 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(n)           
Governing Law
. New York law.
(o)           
Waiver of Jury Trial
. Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Transaction. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such a suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Transaction, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications provided herein.
(p)           
Right to Extend
. Bank may postpone any date of delivery by Bank, with respect to some or all of the Options, if Bank reasonably determines that such extension is reasonably necessary to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Bank were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
(q)           
Registration
. Counterparty hereby agrees that if, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, the Shares (the "
Hedge Shares
") acquired by Bank for the purpose of hedging its obligations pursuant to the Transaction cannot be sold in the U.S. public market by Bank without registration under the Securities Act, Counterparty shall, at its election: (i) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a registered offering, make available to Bank an effective registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the resale of such Hedge Shares and (A) enter into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, substantially in the form of an un derwriting agreement for a registered offering, (B) provide accountant's "comfort" letters in customary form for registered offerings of equity securities, (C) provide disclosure opinions of nationally recognized outside counsel to Counterparty reasonably acceptable to Bank, (D) provide other customary opinions, certificates and closing documents customary in form for registered offerings of equity securities and (E) afford Bank a reasonable opportunity to conduct a "due diligence" investigation with respect to Counterparty customary in scope for underwritten offerings of equity securities;
provided, however
, that if Bank, in its reasonable discretion, is not satisfied with access to due diligence materials, the results of its due diligence investigation, or the procedures and documentation for the registered offering referred to above, then clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 9(q) shall apply at the election of Counterparty; (ii ) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a private placement, enter into a private placement agreement substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, including customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to Bank, due diligence rights (for Bank or any designated buyer of the Hedge Shares from Bank), opinions and certificates and such other documentation as is customary for private placements agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Bank (in which case, the Calculation Agent shall make any adjustments to the terms of the Transaction that are necessary, in its reasonable judgment, to compensate Bank for any discount from the public market price of the Shares incurred on the sale of Hedge Shares in a private placement); or (iii) purchase the Hedge Shares from Bank at the VWAP Price on such Exchange Business Days, and in the amounts, reasonably requested by Bank.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Confirmation or Section 12.7(b) of the Equity Definitions, in determining any amount payable in respect of a Cancellation and Payment, the value of this Transaction shall be determined based on the volatility, expected dividend yield and stock loan rate of the Shares assuming that no Fundamental Change had occurred or been announced.

Transfer or Assignment
.

hedging of this Transaction (the 
Beneficial Ownership Percentage
) exceeds 8% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares and (y) in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, Bank reasonably determines that it would be inadvisable for it or its Affiliates to engage in alternative hedging transactions which would enable them to reduce the Beneficial Ownership Percentage other than by transfer, assignment or termination, then Bank, in its discretion, (i) shall have the right to transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party, so long as such third party has a long-term credit rating equal to or better than A1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and A+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or their respective successors (or is guaranteed by a party that satisfies this condition) and such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions, and (ii) if Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage is reduced to 8% or less, Bank may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the 
Terminated Portion
) of the Transaction, such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage following such partial termination will be approximately equal to 8%. In the event that Bank so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of the Transaction, a payment or delivery shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to the Terminated Portion of the Transaction, (ii) Counterparty shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of the Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction.
Transfer Conditions
 means that: (i) Counterparty shall have received a duly executed acceptance and assumption by the transferee of the obligations under this Transaction in a form satisfactory to Counterparty; (ii) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, be required to pay the transferee on any payment date an amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than an amount in respect of which Counterparty would have been required to pay to Bank in the absence of the transfer and (B) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, receive from the transferee on any payment date an amount (after taking into account any additional amount payable under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement) less than the amount which Counterparty would have received from Bank in the absence of such transfer as a result of any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax (as such term is defined in the Agreement) under Section 2(d)(i); and (iii) an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event will not occur as a result of the transfer.
(h)           
Staggered Settlement
. Bank may, if Net Share Settlement is applicable, by notice to Counterparty prior to the Settlement Date (the 
Nominal Settlement Date
), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a 
Staggered Settlement Date
) or at two or more times on the Nominal Settlement Date as follows:
(i)         in such notice, Bank will specify to Counterparty the related Staggered Settlement Dates (each of which will be on or prior to such Nominal Settlement Date) or delivery times and how it will allocate the Shares it is required to deliver under Net Share Settlement (above) among the Staggered Settlement Dates or delivery times; and
(ii)          the aggregate number of Shares that Bank will deliver to Counterparty hereunder on all such Staggered Settlement Dates and delivery times will equal the number of Shares that Bank would otherwise be required to deliver on such Nominal Settlement Date.
(i)

Early Unwind Date
), the Transaction shall automatically terminate (the 
Early Unwind
) on the Early Unwind Date and (i) the Transaction and all of the respective rights and obligations of Bank and Counterparty thereunder shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii) if the failure to consummate the sale of the Units results from a breach by Counterparty of any representation of or any undertaking by Counterparty contained in the Purchase Agreement, Counterparty shall pay to Bank an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses relating to the unwinding of Bank's reasonable hedging activities in respect of the Transaction (including market losses incurred in reselling any Shares
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
 
purchased by Bank or its affiliates in connection with such reasonable hedging activities). Following such termination, cancellation and payment, each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or liabilities of either party arising out of and to be performed in connection with the Transaction either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date. The amount of any such reimbursement shall be determined by Bank in its reasonable good faith discretion.

Disclosure

Effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transaction, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
(l)            
Setoff
. Except as provided in this Section 9(l), obligations under this Transaction shall not be set off by Bank against any other obligations of Counterparty, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, Bank shall have the right to set off any obligation that it may have to Counterparty under this Confirmation, including without limitation any obligation to make any payment of cash or delivery of Shares to Counterparty, against any obligation Counterparty may have to Bank under any other agreement between Bank and Counterparty relating to Shares (each such contract or agreement, a 
Separate Agreement
), including without limitation any obligation to make a payment of cash or a delivery of Shares or any other property or securities. For this purpose, Bank shall be entitled to convert any obligation (or the relevant portion of such obligation) denominated in one currency into another currency at the rate of exchange at which it would be able to purchase the relevant amount of such currency, and to convert any obligation to deliver any non-cash property into an obligation to deliver cash in an amount calculated by reference to the market value of such property as of the Early Termination Date, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
that in the case of a set-off of any obligation to release or deliver assets against any right to receive fungible assets, such obligation and right shall be set off in kind; and
provided further
that in determining the value of any obligation to deliver Shares, the value at any time of such obligation shall be determined by reference to the market value of the Shares at such time, as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent. If an obligation is unascertained at the time of any such set-off, the Calculation Agent may in good faith estimate the amount or value of such obligation, in which case set-off will be effected in respect of that estimate, and the relevant party shall account to the other party at the time such obligation or right is ascertained.

(p)           
Right to Extend
. Bank may postpone any date of delivery by Bank, with respect to some or all of the Options, if Bank reasonably determines that such extension is reasonably necessary to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Bank were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
(q)           
Registration
. Counterparty hereby agrees that if, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, the Shares (the 
Hedge Shares

(d)           
Regulation M
. Counterparty was not on the Trade Date engaged in a distribution, as such term is used in Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
Exchange Act
"), of any securities of Counterparty, other than a distribution meeting the requirements of the exception set forth in Rules 101(b)(10) and 102(b)(7) of Regulation M. Counterparty shall not, until the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the Trade Date, engage in any such distribution.
(e)           
No Manipulation
. Counterparty is not entering into this Transaction to create actual or apparent trading activity in the Shares (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) or to raise or depress or otherwise manipulate the price of the Shares (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) or otherwise in violation of the Exchange Act.
(f)           
Board Authorization
. This Transaction was approved by its board of directors and publicly announced, solely for the purposes stated in such board resolution and public disclosure and, prior to any exercise of Options hereunder, Counterparty's board of directors will have duly authorized any repurchase of Shares pursuant to this Transaction. Counterparty further represents that there is no internal policy, whether written or oral, of Counterparty that would prohibit Counterparty from entering into any aspect of this Transaction, including, but not limited to, the purchase of Shares to be made pursuant hereto.
(g)           
Transfer or Assignment
. Bank may transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any of its Affiliates with the consent of Counterparty, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (i) (A) if Bank has a Credit Support Provider, Counterparty shall have received a duly executed full unconditional guarantee by Bank's Credit Support Provider, in favor of Counterparty, of the obligations of such Affiliate substantially in the form of the guarantee provided by Bank's Credit Support Provider hereunder, or (B) if Bank does not have a Credit Support Provider, the creditworthiness of such Affiliate is satisfactory to Counterparty, and (ii) such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions.
If (x) the "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder) of Bank and its Affiliates of Shares beneficially owned in connection with Bank's hedging of this Transaction (the "
Beneficial Ownership Percentage
") exceeds 8% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares and (y) in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, Bank reasonably determines that it would be inadvisable for it or its Affiliates to engage in alternative hedging transactions which would enable them to reduce the Beneficial Ownership Percentage other than by transfer, assignment or termination, then Bank, in its discretion, (i) shall have the right to transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party, so long as such third party has a long-term credit rating equal to or better than A1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and A+ by
 
 
 
 
 
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or their respective successors (or is guaranteed by a party that satisfies this condition) and such transfer complies with the Transfer Conditions, and (ii) if Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party after its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage is reduced to 8% or less, Bank may designate any Scheduled Trading Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "
Terminated Portion
") of the Transaction, such that the Beneficial Ownership Percentage following such partial termination will be approximately equal to 8%. In the event that Bank so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of the Transaction, a payment or delivery shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to the Terminated Portion of the Transaction, (ii) Counterparty shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of the Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction.
"
Transfer Conditions
" means that: (i) Counterparty shall have received a duly executed acceptance and assumption by the transferee of the obligations under this Transaction in a form satisfactory to Counterparty; (ii) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, be required to pay the transferee on any payment date an amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than an amount in respect of which Counterparty would have been required to pay to Bank in the absence of the transfer and (B) Counterparty will not, as a result of the transfer, receive from the transferee on any payment date an amount (after taking into account any additional amount payable under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement) less than the amount which Counterparty would have received from Bank in the absence of such transfer as a result of any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax (as such term is defined in the Agreement) under Section 2(d)(i); and (iii) an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event will not occur as a result of the transfer.
(h)           
Staggered Settlement
. Bank may, if Net Share Settlement is applicable, by notice to Counterparty prior to the Settlement Date (the "
Nominal Settlement Date
"), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a "
Staggered Settlement Date
") or at two or more times on the Nominal Settlement Date as follows:
(i)
       
in such notice, Bank will specify to Counterparty the related Staggered Settlement Dates (each of which will be on or prior to such Nominal Settlement Date) or delivery times and how it will allocate the Shares it is required to deliver under "Net Share Settlement" (above) among the Staggered Settlement Dates or delivery times; and
(ii)
      
the aggregate number of Shares that Bank will deliver to Counterparty hereunder on all such Staggered Settlement Dates and delivery times will equal the number of Shares that Bank would otherwise be required to deliver on such Nominal Settlement Date.
(i)            
Early Unwind
. In the event the sale by Counterparty of the Units is not consummated with the initial purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for any reason by the close of business in New York on June 13, 2006 (or such later date as agreed upon by the parties, which in no event shall be later than the date specified for this purpose in the Purchase Agreement) (June 13, 2006 or such later date being the "
Early Unwind Date
"), the Transaction shall automatically terminate (the "
Early Unwind
") on the Early Unwind Date and (i) the Transaction and all of the respective rights and obligations of Bank and Counterparty thereunder shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii) if the failure to consummate the sale of the Units results from a breach by Counterparty of any representation of or any undertaking by Counterparty contained in the Purchase Agreement, Counterparty shall pay to Bank an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses relating to the unwinding of Bank's reasonable hedging activities in respect of the Transaction (including market losses incurred in reselling any Shares purchased by Bank or its affiliates in connection with such reasonable hedging activities). Following such termination, cancellation and payment, each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or liabilities of either party arising out of and to be performed in connection with the Transaction either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date. The amount of any such reimbursement shall be determined by Bank in its reasonable good faith discretion. Bank shall notify the Company of such amount, including, upon Counterparty's request, an explanation of the basis of determination of such amount, and Counterparty shall pay such amount in immediately available funds on the Early Unwind Date. Bank and Counterparty represent and acknowledge to the other that upon an Early Unwind and following the payment referred to above, all obligations with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed fully and
 
 
 
 
 
finally discharged. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9(i) shall become effective as of the Trade Date and shall remain in effect whether or not the Effective Date of the Transaction occurs.
(j)            
Designation of Agent
. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing the Bank to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, the Bank may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Bank's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. The Bank shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty to the extent of any such performance.
(k)           
Disclosure
. Effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transaction, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
(l)            
Setoff
. Except as provided in this Section 9(l), obligations under this Transaction shall not be set off by Bank against any other obligations of Counterparty, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise. Upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, Bank shall have the right to set off any obligation that it may have to Counterparty under this Confirmation, including without limitation any obligation to make any payment of cash or delivery of Shares to Counterparty, against any obligation Counterparty may have to Bank under any other agreement between Bank and Counterparty relating to Shares (each such contract or agreement, a "
Separate Agreement
"), including without limitation any obligation to make a payment of cash or a delivery of Shares or any other property or securities. For this purpose, Bank shall be entitled to convert any obligation (or the relevant portion of such obligation) denominated in one currency into another currency at the rate of exchange at which it would be able to purchase the relevant amount of such currency, and to convert any obligation to deliver any non-cash property into an obligation to deliver cash in an amount calculated by reference to the market value of such property as of the Early Termination Date, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
that in the case of a set-off of any obligation to release or deliver assets against any right to receive fungible assets, such obligation and right shall be set off in kind; and
provided further
that in determining the value of any obligation to deliver Shares, the value at any time of such obligation shall be determined by reference to the market value of the Shares at such time, as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent. If an obligation is unascertained at the time of any such set-off, the Calculation Agent may in good faith estimate the amount or value of such obligation, in which case set-off will be effected in respect of that estimate, and the relevant party shall account to the other party at the time such obligation or right is ascertained.
(m)          
Securities Contract; Swap Agreement
. Each of Bank and Counterparty agrees and acknowledges that Bank is a "swap participant" and "financial participant" within the meaning of Sections 101(22), 101(53C) and 101(22A) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "
Bankruptcy Code
"). The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge (A) that this Confirmation is (i) a "securities contract," as such term is defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "settlement payment," as such term is defined in Section 741(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) a "swap agreement," as such term is defined in Section 101(53B) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder is a "transfer," as such term is defined in Section 101(54) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (B) that Bank is entitled to the protections afforded by, among other sections, Section 362(b)(6), 362(b)(17), 546(e), 546(g), 555 and 560 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(n)

(o)           
Waiver of Jury Trial

Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such a suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Transaction, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications provided herein.
(p)           
Right to Extend
. Bank may postpone any date of delivery by Bank, with respect to some or all of the Options, if Bank reasonably determines that such extension is reasonably necessary to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that
 
 
 
 
 
would, if Bank were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
(q)           
Registration
. Counterparty hereby agrees that if, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of Bank based upon advice of counsel and as a result of events occurring after the Trade Date, the Shares (the "
Hedge Shares
") acquired by Bank for the purpose of hedging its obligations pursuant to the Transaction cannot be sold in the U.S. public market by Bank without registration under the Securities Act, Counterparty shall, at its election: (i) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a registered offering, make available to Bank an effective registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the resale of such Hedge Shares and (A) enter into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, substantially in the form of an underwriting agreement for a registered offering, (B) provide accountant's "comfort" letters in customary form for registered offerings of equity securities, (C) provide disclosure opinions of nationally recognized outside counsel to Counterparty reasonably acceptable to Bank, (D) provide other customary opinions, certificates and closing documents customary in form for registered offerings of equity securities and (E) afford Bank a reasonable opportunity to conduct a "due diligence" investigation with respect to Counterparty customary in scope for underwritten offerings of equity securities;
provided, however
, that if Bank, in its reasonable discretion, is not satisfied with access to due diligence materials, the results of its due diligence investigation, or the procedures and documentation for the registered offering referred to above, then clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 9(q) shall apply at the election of Counterparty; (ii) in order to allow Bank to sell the Hedge Shares in a private placement, enter into a private placement agreement substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, including customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to Bank, due diligence rights (for Bank or any designated buyer of the Hedge Shares from Bank), opinions and certificates and such other documentation as is customary for private placements agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Bank (in which case, the Calculation Agent shall make any adjustments to the terms of the Transaction that are necessary, in its reasonable judgment, to compensate Bank for any discount from the public market price of the Shares incurred on the sale of Hedge Shares in a private placement); or (iii) purchase the Hedge Shares from Bank at the VWAP Price on such Exchange Business Days, and in the amounts, reasonably requested by Bank.
(r)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Confirmation or Section 12.7(b) of the Equity Definitions, in determining any amount payable in respect of a Cancellation and Payment, the value of this Transaction shall be determined based on the volatility, expected dividend yield and stock loan rate of the Shares assuming that no Fundamental Change had occurred or been announced. If any amount is payable by Bank to Counterparty in connection with such a Cancellation and Payment, Counterparty may elect for such payment to be satisfied by the delivery one Settlement Cycle following the 30 Trading Day referred to in clause (ii) below of a number of Shares equal to (i) the amount payable in connection with the Cancellation and Payment

(t)            
Limit on Beneficial Ownership
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this Confirmation, in no event shall Bank be entitled to receive, or be deemed to receive, any Shares to the extent (but only to the extent) that receipt of such Shares by Bank would result in Bank's "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) being equal to or greater than 9.0% or more of the outstanding Shares. Any purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in Bank directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares. If any delivery owed to Bank hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Counterparty's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Counterparty shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Clearance
 
 
 
 
 
System Business Day after, Bank gives notice to Counterparty that such delivery would not result in Bank directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares.
                    
(u)
          
Role of Agent

Agent is not a principal to this Agreement and shall have no responsibility or liability (including, without limitation, by way of guarantee, endorsement or otherwise) to Bank or Counterparty in respect of this Agreement, including, without limitation, in respect of the failure of Bank or Counterparty to pay or perform under this Agreement. Each of Bank and Counterparty agrees to proceed solely against the other to collect or recover any securities or money owing to it in connection with or as a result of this Agreement.
