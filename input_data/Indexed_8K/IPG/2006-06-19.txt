On June 13, 2006, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "
Company
") completed a transaction that provides it with a new source of committed stand-by liquidity and a new letter of credit facility (the "
ELF Financing
"). In connection with the ELF Financing, the Company entered into these material agreements:
The ELF Financing and these agreements are summarized below. Each of these agreements is filed herewith as an exhibit, and the summaries below are qualified in their entirety by the full terms of the agreements.
The ELF Financing
ELF is a new special-purpose entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands, in which the Company has no equity or other interest and which the Company does not expect to consolidate for financial reporting purposes. In the ELF Financing, ELF sold securities to institutional investors. Through a group of initial purchasers led by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, ELF sold:
 
 
 
 
 
ELF also sold to MSCS:
 
 
The ELF Series A Notes and the ELF Series B Notes (together, the "
ELF Senior Notes
") and the ELF Junior Notes (together with the ELF Senior Notes, the "
ELF Notes
") are issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 13, 2006 (the "
Indenture
") between ELF and LaSalle Bank National Association, as Indenture Trustee and Notes Issuer Representative. Because of the subordination provisions and other structural features, the ELF Junior Notes will function like equity to support the ELF Senior Notes.
ELF received $750 million in proceeds of these sales, which it used to purchase AAA-rated liquid assets. It will hold the liquid assets pending any request for borrowing from the Company, or any drawing on any letters of credit issued for the account of the Company, under the credit facility described below, which ELF will fund by selling liquid assets. ELF also entered into an interest rate swap (the "
Interest Rate Swap
") with an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, the effect of which is to exchange the yield ELF receives on its liquid assets, together with payments received under the Credit Agreement, against LIBOR to service the interest on the ELF Notes.
The Company is not a party to the ELF Notes, the Indenture or the Interest Rate Swap. Under certain circumstances, including events of default under the Credit Agreement and under the Notes, holders of ELF Notes may elect to receive in exchange for their Notes loans and reimbursement obligations under the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
Under the Credit Agreement, ELF is obligated at the Company's request to make cash advances to the Company and to issue letters of credit for the account of the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750 million outstanding at any time. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed $600 million at any time. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and reborrowed, and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase, subject to the overall limit of $750 million and the $600 million limit on letters of credit.
The Company will pay interest on any outstanding advances under the Credit Agreement at an annual rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 0.78% per annum (the "
Applicable Margin
"). The Company will also pay commitment fees on the undrawn amount under the Credit Agreement at an annual rate equal to the Applicable Margin, plus an additional facility fee equal to 0.15%. The Credit Agreement will expire on June 15, 2009.
The continued availability of the Credit Agreement, and its terms, can be affected if certain events occur that have consequences under the terms of the ELF Notes. In particular, holders of the ELF Senior Notes are entitled to require the repurchase of their notes, at par plus accrued interest, in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the Credit Agreement, involving the Company. The Credit Agreement provides that ELF may reduce the total commitment under the Credit Agreement following a fundamental change, and the Indenture provides that ELF will reduce the total commitment by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any ELF Senior Notes that are tendered for repurchase and not repurchased by the holders of ELF Junior Notes. The Applicable Margin may also change following any
 
 
 
 
repurchases pursuant to these provisions. The commitment under the Credit Agreement may also terminate upon the occurrence of specified events.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Warrant Agreement
The Company issued a total of 67,898,967 warrants under the Warrant Agreement, consisting of 29,072,092 Capped Warrants and 38,826,875 Uncapped Warrants.
Each warrant will entitle the holder to receive, following expiration of the warrant on June 15, 2009, an amount in (a) cash, (b) shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share, or (c) a combination of cash and shares, at the Company's option. The amount will be based, subject to customary adjustments, on the difference between the market price of one share of common stock (over 30 trading days following expiration) and the stated exercise price of the warrant. For the Uncapped Warrants, the exercise price is $11.91 per warrant. For the Capped Warrants, the exercise price is $9.89 per warrant and the amount deliverable upon exercise is capped so a holder will not benefit from appreciation of the common stock above $12.36 per share.
If a fundamental change, as defined in the Warrant Agreement, occurs prior to June 15, 2009, each holder will have the right to exercise its warrants at any time on or after the effective date of such fundamental change until the 30th trading day after the effective date. The Company will, in connection with any such exercise by a holder, pay to the holder an early settlement amount, which may be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination thereof at the Company's option, and which will reflect an adjustment to the exercise price.
A copy of the Warrant Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. As disclosed in previous filings, the Company has entered into call spread transactions to reduce the potential dilution or cash cost upon exercise of the Uncapped Warrants.
Letter of Credit Agreements
The Company is required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support commitments of the Company and/or its subsidiaries to purchase media placements, mostly in locations outside the United States, or to satisfy other obligations. The Citibank Letter of Credit Agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit with an aggregate available amount not to exceed $250 million at any time, which the Company intends to use for this purpose. The Citibank Letter of Credit Agreement expires June 15, 2009. Upon termination of the Prior Credit Agreement (defined under Item 1.02 below), letters of credit with an aggregate available amount of approximately $208 million, which had been issued under the Prior Credit Agreement, remained outstanding and are now governed by the new Citibank Letter of Credit Agreement.
Under the Citibank Letter of Credit Agreement, any letters of credit issued under that agreement must be backed by (a) letters of credit issued by Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. under the Morgan Stanley Letter of Credit Agreement or (b) letters of credit issued by other backstop letter of credit issuers acceptable to Citibank or (c) cash deposits.
Letters of credit issued under the Morgan Stanley Letter of Credit Agreement, including those issued to Citibank as described in the preceding paragraph, are required to be backed by letters of credit issued by ELF under the Credit Agreement. Although all letters of credit issued under these two facilities
 
 
 
 
currently support, directly or indirectly, letters of credit issued under the Citibank Letter of Credit Agreement, the Company may choose to request that additional letters of credit under either the Credit
Agreement or the Morgan Stanley Letter of Credit Agreement be issued directly to other beneficiaries, in an aggregate available amount for all letters of credit not to exceed the $600 million overall letter of credit limit described above under Credit Agreement.
Copies of the Letter of Credit Agreement and the Morgan Stanley Letter of Credit Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
On June 13, 2006, the Company terminated the Amended and Restated 3-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2004, amended and restated as of September 27, 2005 (the "
Prior Credit Agreement
"), among the Company, the Initial Lenders Named Therein, and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
On June 13, 2006, the Company issued warrants that ELF resold, as described in Item 1.01 above, to investors that are qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The terms of the warrants are described in Item 1.01 above. In connection with the ELF Financing, the Company paid $22.5 million in underwriting commissions.

If the Agent, on behalf of the Initial Lender, notifies the Borrower that (notwithstanding any prepayment to be made pursuant to clause (i) above) an L/C Excess exists on any Excess Notification Date, the Borrower may, by not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Business Day following the date of receipt of such notice (the "
Designation Deadline
"), deliver to the Agent, the L/C Issuer and the L/C Administrator a notice in writing (the "
Designation Notice
") identifying
 
19
 
 
Letters of Credit to be terminated and/or directing the L/C Administrator on behalf of the L/C Issuer to reduce the Available Amount of identified Letters of Credit as to which partial drawings are permitted;
provided, however
, that any such notice shall only be a Designation Notice for the purposes hereof if, after giving effect to all such terminations or reductions specified in such notice, the L/C Excess would be eliminated. If the L/C Administrator shall have received a Designation Notice by the Designation Deadline, the L/C Administrator shall deliver an L/C Termination Notice to the beneficiary of each Letter of Credit identified in the Designation Notice stating that, with effect from the fifth Business Day following the date of the delivery of the L/C Termination Notice, either the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit will be reduced or such Letter of Credit shall be terminated (as specified in the Designation Notice). If the L/C Administrator shall not have received a Designation Notice by the Designation Deadline, the L/C Administrator shall deliver an L/C Termination Notice to the beneficiary of one or more Letters of Credit stating that, with effect from the fifth Business Day following the date of delivery of the L/C Termination Notice, such Letter of Credit shall be terminated or the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit shall be reduced;
provided, however
, that the L/C Administrator shall
first
, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof, reduce the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit selected by it in its sole discretion to the extent necessary to cause the L/C Excess to be eliminated and,
second
, if the Available Amount of all such Letters of Credit is not sufficient to eliminate such L/C Excess, terminate outstanding Letters of Credit selected by it in its sole discretion to the extent it reasonably deems necessary to eliminate such L/C Excess. In each case, each such Letter of Credit shall be terminated, or the Available Amount thereof reduced, in accordance with its terms with effect from the fifth Business Day following the date of delivery of the applicable L/C Termination Notice, and the Borrower shall be obligated immediately to repay any Reimbursement Obligation arising following the delivery of the applicable L/C Termination Notice and any drawings made by the applicable beneficiary under the Letter of Credit to which any such L/C Termination Notice applies.
(iii)
 
Each prepayment of an Advance made pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) shall be made together with interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. Upon the termination or reduction in the Available Amount of a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.09(b), the Borrower shall pay all fees with respect to such Letter of Credit or such Available Amount (as applicable) that shall be accrued and unpaid through the date of such termination or reduction.
Section 2.10
. Cost Adjustments.
If, due to either (a) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof or (b) the compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date hereof by any governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or of making, funding or maintaining Advances or to the L/C Issuer of agreeing to issue or of issuing or
 
20
 
 
maintaining Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.10(a) any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of the overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) is organized or, in the case of any Lender, has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.07(c), from time to time, upon demand by such Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) for such increased cost;
provided, however
, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 2.10 shall in no event apply to any increase in such costs to the extent arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the Credit Linked Notes, the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants or otherwise involving the offering or sale of any such securities, or any hedging transaction entered into in connection with the Loan Documents or any of the foregoing documents. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable), shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts.
Section 2.11
. Payments and Computations.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars in same day funds and without deduction, setoff or counterclaim. On and prior to the Termination Date, each such payment shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Initial Lender or the L/C Issuer by wire transfer to the Collection Account, except payments to be made for the account of the Agent or the L/C Administrator pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement, which shall be paid directly to the parties entitled to such payments at the respective accounts designated by such parties. Following the Termination Date, each such payment shall be made to the Agent by wire transfer to the Agent's Account, and the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.12, Section 2.16 or Article 9) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender, the Agent, the L/C Administrator or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, the Agent, the L/C Administrator or the L/C Issuer, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of any Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.
(b)
  
All computations of interest shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. Each
 
21
 
 
determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)
   
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment hereunder or under any Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be.
Section 2.12
. Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under any Notes for the account of the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer or the Initial Lender shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto imposed by the United States, any political subdivision thereunder or other Relevant Jurisdiction, excluding taxes imposed on its overall net income or the overall net income of a branch or office and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under any Notes being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
"), unless such deduction is required by law. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.12, if the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer or the Initial Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer or the Initial Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)
   
In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies, imposed by any jurisdiction, that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Notes (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
").
(c)
   
The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer and the Initial Lender for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed by the United States, any political subdivision thereof or other Relevant Jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, and shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.07(c), indemnify the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer, the Initial Lender and each other Lender for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Other Taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) imposed on or paid by the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer or such Lender (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest
 
22
 
 
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date the Agent, the L/C Administrator, the L/C Issuer or such Lender (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
(d)
   
Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. In the case of any payment hereunder or under any Notes by or on behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, the Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsections (e), (f) and (g), the terms "United States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(e)
   
The Initial Lender (i) hereby represents and warrants that it will file a timely election effective its date of formation under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 to be classified other than as an association for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "
Non-Corporate Entity
") and will not change such election, and (ii) in its capacity as both Initial Lender and L/C Issuer, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as the Initial Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower (A) if a single Person is the owner of all of the Junior Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes (any Person owning an interest in Junior Notes for such purposes, an "
Owner
"), two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, in which such Owner certifies that it is a United States person, or (B) if the Initial Lender has more than one Owner, two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8IMY, to which the Initial Lender attaches, with respect to each Owner, an original Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, in which such Owner certifies that it is a United States person. Should the Initial Lender or any of its Owners become aware that the Initial Lender is not treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Non-Corporate Entity, the Initial Lender shall provide the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that the Initial Lender is exempt from United States withholding tax on interest payments pursuant to this Agreement or any Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the Initial Lender, its Owner(s), the Borrower, the L/C Issuer and the Agent shall take no position on any tax return that is inconsistent with the characterization of the Initial Lender as a Non-Corporate Entity, or take any action that could reasonably be expected to undermine such characterization, (y) if the Initial Lender has complied with the requirements under this Section 2.12(e), it shall not be required to incur any expenses or take any other actions in connection with defending in any proceeding the characterization of the Initial Lender as a Non-Corporate Entity (unless the Borrower pays for such expenses), and (z) if the Initial Lender has complied with the requirements under this Section 2.12(e) and is
 
23
 
 
nevertheless treated as an association for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Initial Lender shall not be treated as having breached its representation under Section 2.12(e)(i).
(f)
   
For any period with respect to which an Owner is not a United States person or the Initial Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form(s) described in Section 2.12(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above) or if the Initial Lender otherwise breaches its representations or agreements under Section 2.12(e), neither the Initial Lender nor the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to additional amounts under Section 2.12(a) or to indemnification under Section 2.12(c) with respect to Taxes imposed as a result of such failure or breach;
provided, however
, that should the Initial Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps at the Initial Lender's expense as the Initial Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Initial Lender to recover such Taxes.
(g)
  
The Agent and the L/C Administrator each represents that it is a United States person and agrees to provide to the Borrower on or before the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower, an original Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, in which it certifies that it is a United States person. If the Agent or the L/C Administrator breaches its representations or agreements in the preceding sentence or Section 2.12(e), then the Agent or the L/C Administrator, respectively, shall not be entitled to additional amounts under Section 2.12(a) or to indemnification under Section 2.12(c) with respect to Taxes imposed as a result of such breach.
(h)
  
The Borrower hereby warrants and represents that it will not claim a current deduction on any of its tax returns with respect to its payment of commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or its delivery of Warrants to the Initial Lender pursuant to Section 3.03, and will instead capitalize such items for U.S. federal income tax purposes as required by Rev. Rul. 81-160 1981-1 CB 312.
Section 2.13
. Sharing of Payments, Etc.
If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.12, Section 2.16 or Article 9) in excess of its Ratable Share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so
 
24
 
 
recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 2.14
. Evidence of Debt.
The Agent shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to each Lender resulting from Advances from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by the Agent on behalf of any Lender to the Borrower to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender in a principal amount up to the amount of the Commitment of (or, if the Commitment shall have been terminated, the Advances owed to) such Lender.
Section 2.15
. Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit.
The Letters of Credit and the proceeds of the Loans shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such Letters of Credit and such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries.
Section 2.16
. Fundamental Changes.
(a)
The Borrower shall, within ten Business Days after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, (i) deliver a notice (a "
Fundamental Change Notice
") of such Fundamental Change to the Agent and, prior to the Termination Date, the Initial Lender (the date of such notice, a "
Fundamental Change Notice Date
"), (ii) issue a press release including the Fundamental Change Notice and (iii) publish such Fundamental Change Notice on its web site or such other similar publicly available medium as shall be available at such time.
(b)
   
(i) If a Fundamental Change shall occur prior to the Termination Date, the Initial Lender may, in its sole discretion on the day that is 26 Business Days following a Fundamental Change Notice Date, elect to terminate in whole or reduce in part the amount of the Commitment (or, if a Tranching Effective Date in respect of such Fundamental Change shall have occurred, terminate in whole or reduce in part the amount of any Tranche of the Commitment) by delivering a notice in writing to the Borrower and the Agent (such notice, a "
Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice
"). The Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice will (A) state either (x) that, with effect from the date that is seven Business Days following the date of receipt by the Borrower of the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice (the "
Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date
") the Commitment (or any Tranche of the Commitment) will be terminated in full, or (y) that with effect from the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the amount of the Commitment (or any Tranche of the Commitment) will be reduced by a specified amount, (B) if applicable, identify the Tranche(s) of the Commitment to which such termination or reduction shall apply and (C) set forth the Exposure Excess (if any) that would be anticipated to result from such reduction as of the Fundamental Change
 
25
 
 
Commitment Reduction Date (assuming no Borrowing or prepayment of Loans and no issuance, expiration or termination of, and no increase or decrease in the Available Amount under, any Letter of Credit occurs from the date of such Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice to the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date). With effect from the applicable Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the Commitment (or the applicable Tranche of the Commitments) shall be automatically terminated in accordance with, or reduced by the amount set forth in, the applicable Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice.
(ii)
   
If any termination or reduction in the Commitment pursuant to clause (i) above would cause an Exposure Excess to exist on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the Borrower shall, on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, prepay Advances in an outstanding principal amount equal to the Exposure Excess (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Reimbursement Obligations that will arise on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date following the delivery by the Agent of an L/C Termination Notice (if any) in accordance with clause (iii) below).
(iii)
 
If, after giving effect to (1) any termination or reduction in the Commitment pursuant to clause (i) above and (2) prepayment of all Advances on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date pursuant to clause (ii) above (other than prepayments of Reimbursement Obligations resulting from the application of this clause (iii)), an L/C Excess would exist on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the Borrower may, by not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Business Day following the date of receipt of the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice (the "
Fundamental Change Designation Deadline
") deliver to the Agent, the L/C Issuer and the L/C Administrator a notice in writing (the "
Fundamental Change Designation Notice
") identifying Letters of Credit to be terminated and/or directing the L/C Administrator on behalf of the L/C Issuer to reduce the Available Amount of identified Letters of Credit as to which partial drawings are permitted;
provided, however
, that any such notice shall only be a Fundamental Change Designation Notice for the purposes hereof if, after giving effect to all terminations or reductions specified in such notice, the L/C Excess would be eliminated as of the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date. If the L/C Administrator shall have received a Fundamental Change Designation Notice by the Fundamental Change Designation Deadline, the L/C Administrator shall deliver an L/C Termination Notice to the beneficiary of each Letter of Credit identified in the Fundamental Change Designation Notice stating that, with effect from the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, either the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit will be reduced or the Letter of Credit shall be terminated (as specified in the Fundamental Change Designation Notice). If the L/C Administrator shall not have received a Fundamental Change Designation Notice by the Fundamental Change Designation Deadline, the L/C Administrator shall deliver an L/C Termination Notice to the beneficiaries of one or more Letters of Credit then outstanding stating that, with effect from the Fundamental Change Commitment
 
26
 
 
Reduction Date, the Letter of Credit held by such beneficiary shall be terminated or the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit shall be reduced;
provided, however
, that the L/C Administrator shall,
first
, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof, reduce the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit selected by it in its sole discretion to the extent necessary to cause the L/C Excess to be eliminated and,
second
, if the Available Amount of all such Letters of Credit is not sufficient to eliminate such L/C Excess, terminate outstanding Letters of Credit selected by it in its sole discretion to the extent it reasonably deems necessary to eliminate such L/C Excess. In each case, each such Letter of Credit shall be terminated, or the Available Amount thereof reduced, in accordance with its terms with effect from the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date.
(iv)
 
If, pursuant to this Section 2.16(b), the Initial Lender elects to terminate or reduce any Tranche of Commitments created pursuant to Section 6.03 following a Fundamental Change, then immediately after giving effect to such termination or reduction, (x) any remaining Advances and Letters of Credit (and unpaid interest and Letter of Credit fees in respect thereof) shall be automatically reallocated, to and among the remaining Tranche or Tranches
pro rata
based on the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the remaining Tranche or Tranches and (y) any accrued but unpaid commitment fees shall be allocated among the Tranche or Tranches of Commitments as in effect immediately prior to any such termination or reduction but after giving effect to the allocation referred to in the preceding clause (x), in each case with effect (for purposes of calculating interest and fees thereafter payable hereunder) from the last Payment Date in respect of which all accrued interest and fees were paid in full. It is understood and agreed that in no event shall the termination or reduction in the Commitments of any Tranche pursuant to this Section 2.16(b) result in a requirement to prepay Advances or terminate or reduce Letters of Credit to any greater extent than if no such Tranches had been created pursuant to Section 6.03 and the aggregate amount of such terminations and reductions had been instead applied to the amount of the aggregate Commitment.
(v)
   
On the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Initial Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) accrued and unpaid fees and interest payable hereunder in respect of any Commitment (or Tranche of Commitment) terminated or reduced, in each case to the extent allocable to the Commitment (or Tranche of Commitments) so terminated or the portion of the Commitment (or Tranche of Commitment) so reduced;
provided, however
, that, in the case of a termination or reduction of any Tranche or Tranches of Commitment created pursuant to Section 6.03 following a Fundamental Change, for the purpose of calculating such accrued and unpaid fees and interest, (i) such Tranches shall be deemed to have been created with effect from the last Payment Date in respect of which all accrued interest and fees were paid in full, and (ii) any Advances prepaid, any Letter of Credit terminated or the Available Amount of which was reduced and any commitment fees prepaid, in each case pursuant to this Section 2.16(b), shall
 
28
 
 
be deemed to have been Advances, Letters of Credit and commitment fees of the Tranche so reduced or terminated, or, if more than one Tranche of Commitments is reduced or terminated, shall be deemed to have been allocated
pro rata
between the Tranches based on the amount of such reduction or termination.
(vi)
 
Upon any allocation or reallocation pursuant to clause (iv) or clause (v) above, the Agent shall provide written notice to the Borrower setting forth, with respect to each Tranche (A) the amount of the Commitment allocated to such Tranche, (B) the outstanding principal amount of all Advances allocated to such Tranche, and (C) the portion of the Available Amount of each Letter of Credit allocated to such Tranche. Prior to the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, the Agent shall provide written notice to the Borrower setting forth the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and fees, if any, payable in respect of each Tranche on the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date (assuming no Borrowing or prepayment of Loans and no issuance, expiration or termination of, and no increase or decrease in the Available Amount under, any Letter of Credit occurs from the date of such notice to the Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date).
(vii)
 
Notwithstanding Section 2.11, all payments required to be made by the Borrower on a Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date shall be made prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such date.
(c)
   
If a Fundamental Change shall occur on or after the Termination Date, each Lender may, in its sole discretion on the day that is 26 Business Days following a Fundamental Change Notice Date (a "
Fundamental Change Put Date
"), require the Borrower to repay all, but not less than all, of such Lender's Advances by delivering a notice (a "
Fundamental Change Put Notice
") in writing to the Agent, which shall, on the Fundamental Change Put Date, deliver to the Borrower a notice setting forth the aggregate principal amount of all Advances so required by the Lenders to be prepaid and the amount of interest, accrued through the seventh Business Day following the Fundamental Change Put Date, payable with respect thereto. The Borrower shall, on the day that is seven Business Days following the Fundamental Change Put Date, prepay all Advances, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date of such payment, to the Agent for the account of each Lender that shall have delivered a Fundamental Change Put Notice prior to such Fundamental Change Put Date.
(d)
   
If a Termination Date shall occur after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change but prior to the related Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Date, then for the foregoing purposes (i) any Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.16(b) shall automatically be null and void as if such Fundamental Change Commitment Reduction Notice had not been so delivered, (ii) such Fundamental Change will be deemed to have occurred on the Business Day following such Termination Date and (ii) Section 2.16(c) shall apply.

provided, however
, that no such assignment may occur prior to the Termination Date without the prior written consent of the Borrower, the L/C Issuer and the Agent.

provided
,
however

(d)
  
The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and
 
45
 
 
Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, principal amount of the Advances owing to each Lender from time to time and, in the case of the Initial Lender, the amount of the Commitment from time to time (the "

provided, however
, that nothing in this Section 8.18 shall preclude, or be deemed to estop, the Agent, the L/C Administrator or the Borrower from taking any action prior to the expiration of the aforementioned one year and one day period in any case or proceeding voluntarily filed or commenced by the Initial Lender or the L/C Issuer or in any involuntary insolvency proceeding filed or commenced against the Initial Lender or the L/C Issuer by any Person other than the Agent, the L/C Administrator or the Borrower (as applicable).

ARTICLE 9
SUBORDINATION
Section 9.01
. Agreement to Subordinate; Application of Article.
The indebtedness hereunder with respect to Subordinated Advances, if any, is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 9, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness (as defined in Section 9.15). The subordination provisions are for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
Section 9.02
. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy.
Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Borrower to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Borrower or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Borrower or its property, (a) holders of the Senior Indebtedness are entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Senior Obligations (as defined in Section 9.15) in respect of Senior Indebtedness (and only such payment constituting "
payment in full
") before Subordinated Lenders will be entitled to receive any payment of principal of or interest on the Subordinated Advances; and (b) until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, any distribution to which Subordinated Lenders would be entitled but for these subordination provisions shall instead be made to holders of Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear.
Section 9.03
. Default on Senior Indebtedness.
The Borrower shall not pay the principal of or interest on the Subordinated Advances if at the time any Senior Indebtedness has not been paid when due, whether at maturity, upon mandatory prepayment, acceleration, or otherwise, and such default has not been cured or waived.
Section 9.04
. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.
If a payment or other distribution is made to Subordinated Lenders that because of these subordination provisions should not have been made to them, the Subordinated Lenders that receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
 
50
 
 
 
Section 9.05
. Subrogation.
A distribution made to holders of Senior Indebtedness which, but for these subordination provisions, would have been made to Subordinated Lenders is not, as between the Borrower and Subordinated Lenders, a payment by the Borrower on Senior Indebtedness. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the Subordinated Advances are paid in full, Subordinated Lenders will be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments in respect of Senior Indebtedness.
Section 9.06
. Relative Rights; Subordination Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate.
These subordination provisions define the relative rights of Subordinated Lenders and holders of Senior Indebtedness and do not impair, as between the Borrower and Subordinated Lenders, the obligation of the Borrower to pay principal of and interest on the Subordinated Advances in accordance with their terms. The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Subordinated Advances by reason of these subordination provisions does not prevent the occurrence of a Default, nor do these subordination provisions have any effect on the right of the Subordinated Lenders or the Agent to accelerate the maturity of the Subordinated Advances upon an Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 or prevent the Agent or any Subordinated Lender from exercising its available remedies upon an Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions otherwise payable to Subordinated Lenders.
Section 9.07
. Subordination May Not Be Impaired By the Borrower.
No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination of the Subordinated Advances will be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Borrower or by its failure to comply with this Agreement.
Section 9.08
. Rights of the Agent.
(a)
The Agent may continue to make payments on the Subordinated Advances and will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, the Agent receives written notice from the Borrower or a holder of Senior Indebtedness that payments may not be made as a result of this Article.
(b)
  
The Agent in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Indebtedness with the same rights, including rights under this Article, it would have if it were not the Agent.
Section 9.09
. Distributions and Notices to, and Notices and Consents By, Representatives of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their representative (if any). If there is a representative acting for the holders of any Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the agreements governing such Senior Indebtedness, notices or consents under this Agreement from holders of such Senior Indebtedness may be given only by their representative.
 
51
 
 
 
Section 9.10
. Payments in Permitted Junior Securities.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, distributions to Subordinated Lenders in the form of Permitted Junior Securities (as defined in Section 9.15) of the Borrower are not subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness or otherwise subject to these subordination provisions, and none of the Subordinated Lenders will be obligated to pay over any such payments or distributions to any holder of Senior Indebtedness.
Section 9.11
. Agent Entitled to Rely.
For the purpose of ascertaining the outstanding amount of Senior Indebtedness, the holders thereof, and all other information relevant to making any payment or distribution to holders of Senior Indebtedness pursuant to this Article, the Agent and the Subordinated Lenders are entitled to rely upon an order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9.02 are pending, a certificate of the liquidating trustee or other Person making a payment or distribution to the Agent or to the Subordinated Lenders, or information provided by the holders of Senior Indebtedness. The Agent may defer any payment or distribution pending receipt of evidence or instructions reasonably satisfactory to it or a judicial determination regarding the rights of parties to receive the payment or distribution.
Section 9.12
. Agent to Effectuate Subordination.
Each Subordinated Lender authorizes and directs the Agent on behalf of such Subordinated Lender to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination of the Subordinated Lenders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness as provided in this Article and appoints the Agent as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes, including for the purpose of filing a claim in any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9.02.
Section 9.13
. Agent Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
The Agent will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and will not be liable to any such holders if it mistakenly pays over or distributes to Subordinated Lenders, or to the Borrower or any other Person, any money or assets to which holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled by virtue of this Article.
Section 9.14
. Reliance By Holder of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions; No Waiver.

SCHEDULE 4.01(g)
 
The United Kingdom income tax returns ("
computations
") for The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. for 2004 have been delayed beyond their due date. The primary reason for the delay is that the statutory financial statements had been delayed. Representatives of the Borrower have met with the UK tax authorities ("
HMRC
") and informed them of the delay. The Borrower and HMRC have agreed informally on a revised timetable to file the 2004 returns and the Borrower intends to comply with this timetable.
The Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries are engaged in business in many jurisdictions outside of the United States in addition to the United Kingdom (there are approximately 1,200 legal entities doing business outside of the United States). The Borrower is aware of certain other instances where corporate income tax returns in certain foreign jurisdictions are overdue. Most of these instances arise from delays in producing financial statements arising from the restatement adjustments that needed to be reflected therein.
The Borrower believes that penalties resulting from these instances of late filing of income tax returns outside of the United States would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as a whole.

FORM OF OPINION OF
CLEARY GOTTLIEB STEEN & HAMILTON LLP
[Effective Date]
The parties named as Lenders in
the below-referenced Credit Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
Borrower
"), in connection with that certain 3-Year Credit Agreement dated as of [_______], 2006 (the "
Credit Agreement
"), among the Borrower, the Lenders and L/C Issuer parties thereto, and Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc., as Agent for said Lenders and as L/C Administrator. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(iv) of the Credit Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Borrower and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Borrower and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified (i) the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Borrower in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) that the Notes, as and when issued will conform to the form thereof that we have reviewed.
 
E-1-1
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
1.
            
The Borrower has corporate power to enter into the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to perform its obligations thereunder.
2.
            
The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Borrower.
3.
            
The performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Notes (a) does not require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States, the State of Delaware or the State of New York and (b) does not result in a violation of any applicable United States federal or New York State law or published rule or regulation or the Delaware General Corporation Law.
4.
            
The Credit Agreement is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Borrower.
5.
            
The Notes, when issued in respect of any Advances in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, will be valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Borrower.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Borrower, (a) we have assumed that each party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Borrower regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
We express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought that may limit the rates of interest which may be charged or collected.
We have assumed that any assignments made by or among the Lenders of their rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement will not contravene New York Judiciary Law Section 489 (which makes it a criminal offense to take an
 
E-1-3
 
 
assignment of a debt obligation with the intent of and for the purpose of bringing an action or proceeding thereon).
We note that the designation in Section 8.12(a) of the Credit Agreement of the U.S. federal courts sitting in New York City as the venue for actions or proceedings relating to the Credit Agreement is (notwithstanding the waiver in Section 8.12(b) of the Credit Agreement) subject to the power of such federal court to transfer actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or to dismiss such actions or proceedings on the grounds that such a federal court is an inconvenient forum for such action or proceeding.
With respect to the first sentence of Section 8.12(a) of the Credit Agreement, we express no opinion as to the subject matter jurisdiction of any United States federal court to adjudicate any action relating to the Credit Agreement where jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1332 does not exist.
The opinion expressed in paragraph 3 above relates only to those laws, rules and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to general business entities with respect to performance of transactions of the type referred to in the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States, but we express no opinion as to any state securities or Blue Sky laws or United States federal securities laws.
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be relied on or furnished to any other Person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a copy of this opinion letter may be furnished to, and relied upon by, your successors and a permitted transferee who becomes a party to the Credit Agreement as a Lender thereunder, and you or any such successor or transferee may show this opinion to any governmental authority pursuant to requirements of applicable law or regulations. The opinions expressed herein are rendered on and as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you or any such transferee or governmental authority or any other Person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

FORM OF OPINION OF
IN-HOUSE COUNSEL OF THE BORROWER
[Effective Date]
To each of the Lenders party
to the below-referenced Credit Agreement
3-Year Credit Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(iv) of the 3-Year Credit Agreement dated as of [________], 2006 (the "
Credit Agreement
"), among The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "
Borrower
"), the Lenders and L/C Issuer parties thereto, and Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc., as Agent for said Lenders and as L/C Administrator. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
I have acted as General Counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have examined the following documents:
(1)          An executed copy of the Credit Agreement.
(2)
          
The documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Article 3 of the Credit Agreement.
(3)
          
A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "
Charter
").
(4)
          
A copy of the bylaws of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "
Bylaws
").
(5)
          
A certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, dated __________, 2006, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower in that State.
 
E-2-1
 
 
 
In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Borrower and such other persons as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Borrower in the Credit Agreement).
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
            
The Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.
            
The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any material contractual or legal restriction known to me contained in any material document to which the Borrower is a party or by which it is bound. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
3.
            
To the best of my knowledge, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any third party is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
4.
            
To the best of my knowledge, there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Borrower or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, except as disclosed in the Borrower's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the Effective Date, that are likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
 
E-2-3
 
 
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States.
I am furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a copy of this opinion letter may be furnished to, and relied upon by, your successors and a permitted transferee who becomes a party to the Credit Agreement as a Lender thereunder, and you or any such successor or transferee may show this opinion to any governmental authority pursuant to requirements of applicable law or regulations. The opinions expressed herein are, however, rendered on and as of the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to advise you or any such transferee or governmental authority or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

All Warrants issued under this Warrant Agreement shall in all respects be equally and ratably entitled to the benefits hereof (other than as to terms specific to the Capped Warrants or Uncapped Warrants as set forth herein), without preference, priority, or distinction on account of the actual time of the issuance and authentication or any other terms thereof.
(b)

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF REPRESENTS THAT IT IS A "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) ("QIB"). UNTIL THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE, AS DEFINED IN THE WARRANT AGREEMENT REFERRED TO HEREIN, THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OF THIS SECURITY,
(B) TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QIB THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (C) UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL WARRANT UNDERLYING UNITS, AS DEFINED IN THE WARRANT AGREEMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY OTHER EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR OFFER OR SALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT.
THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE ISSUER OF THIS SECURITY MAY RECEIVE A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS HOLDING POSITIONS IN ITS SECURITIES FROM ONE OR MORE BOOK-ENTRY DEPOSITORIES.
ANY TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT, WILL BE VOID AB INITIO, AND WILL NOT OPERATE TO TRANSFER ANY RIGHTS TO THE TRANSFEREE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY TO THE ISSUER OF THIS SECURITY, THE WARRANT AGENT OR ANY INTERMEDIARY. IF AT ANY TIME
THE
ISSUER DETERMINES IN GOOD FAITH OR IS NOTIFIED THAT THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN WAS IN BREACH OF ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECURITY, THE ISSUER OR THE WARRANT AGENT MAY DECLARE THE ACQUISITION OF THIS SECURITY OR SUCH INTEREST IN THIS SECURITY VOID,
IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH, AT THE TIME GIVEN, AND, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DETERMINATION OR NOTICE OF BREACH, AT THE TIME GIVEN OR AT ANY SUBSEQUENT TIME, THE ISSUER OR THE WARRANT AGENT MAY REQUIRE THAT THIS SECURITY OR SUCH INTEREST HEREIN BE TRANSFERRED TO A PERSON DESIGNATED BY IT."

(iv)
 
  The Company or the Warrant Agent, as applicable may consider the Transfer of any Warrant or any interest therein null and void
ab initio
and refuse to recognize such Transfer if at any time the Company or the Warrant Agent reasonably determines in good faith that the owner of such Warrant or interest was in breach of any representation or covenant contained in the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 2.03(b)(iii). The Company or the Warrant Agent acting at the direction of the Company, as applicable, may require the Transfer of such Warrant or interest to any Person designated by the Company or the Warrant Agent, as applicable, at a price determined in good faith based upon a reasonable estimation of the prevailing price of such Warrants by an independent third party or, if no such independent third party is available or able to determine a price, as determined by the Company in good faith based upon its reasonable estimation of the prevailing price of such Warrants. Each owner of the Warrants, by acceptance of such Warrants, authorizes the Company or the Warrant Agent to take such action. In any such case, none of the Company, the Warrant Agent, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates shall be responsible for any losses that may be incurred as a result of any required Transfer, avoidance of a Transfer or redemption.

(1)
          
REPRESENTS THAT IT IS A "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933;

(d)
  
Any Warrant that is purchased or owned by the Company or any Affiliate thereof may not be resold by the Company or such Affiliate unless registered under the Securities Act or resold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in a transaction that results in such Warrants no longer being "restricted securities" (as defined under Rule 144).

14
 
 
this Warrant Agreement, (i) the reference in the definition of Resale Restriction Termination Date to two years shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be references to such changed period, and (ii) all corresponding references in the Warrants and any restrictive legends thereon or on the Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be references to such changed period,
provided
that such changes shall not become effective if they are otherwise prohibited by, or would otherwise cause a violation of, the then-applicable federal securities laws. The provisions of this clause (e) shall not be effective until such time as the Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate have been received by the Warrant Agent hereunder. This clause (e) shall apply to successive amendments to Rule 144(k) (or any successor rule) changing the holding period thereunder.
Section 2.04
. Transfer, Exchange and Substitution.
(a) Warrants shall be issued in registered form only. The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall maintain, a register (the "
Warrant Register
") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as the Company may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Warrants and transfers, exchanges or substitutions of Warrants as herein provided. All Warrants issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of or substitution for Warrants shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligations, and entitled to the same benefits under this Warrant Agreement, as Warrants surrendered for such registration of transfer, exchange or substitution.
(b)
  
A Warrantholder may transfer a Warrant only upon surrender of such Warrant for registration of transfer. No such transfer shall be effected until, and the transferee shall succeed to the rights of a Warrantholder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer in the Warrant Register by the Warrant Agent. Prior to the registration of any transfer of a Warrant by a Warrantholder as provided herein, the Company, the Warrant Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent may treat the Person in whose name Warrants are registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and as the Person entitled to exercise the rights represented thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding.
(c)
   
Every Warrant presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or substitution shall (if so required by the Company or the Warrant Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a duly executed instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent, by the holder thereof or such Warrantholder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
(d)
   
When Warrants are presented to the Warrant Agent with a request to register the transfer of, or to exchange or substitute, such Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall register the transfer or make the exchange or substitution as requested if its requirements for such transactions and any applicable requirements
 
15
 
 
hereunder are satisfied. To permit registrations of transfers, exchanges and substitutions, the Company shall execute Warrant Certificates at the Warrant Agent's request and the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver such Warrant Certificates. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of or substitution for Warrants, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer of Warrants.
(e)
   
If less than all Warrants represented by a Certificated Warrant are transferred, exchanged or substituted in accordance with this Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Certificate shall be surrendered to the Warrant Agent and a new Warrant Certificate of the same tenor and for the number of Warrants which were not transferred, exchanged or substituted, registered in such name or names as may be directed in writing by the surrendering Warrantholder, shall be executed by the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent and the Warrant Agent shall countersign such new Warrant Certificate and shall deliver such new Warrant Certificate to the Person or Persons entitled to receive the same.

Accordingly, any such owner's beneficial interest in such Global Warrant will be shown only on, and the transfer of such interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee or its Agent Members, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to such records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee or its Agent Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (i) prevent the
 
16
 
 
Company, the Warrant Agent or any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or (ii) impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Warrantholder.

Any Certificated Warrant delivered in exchange for an interest in a Global Warrant pursuant to this Section 2.06(d) shall not bear the Global Warrant Legend, but shall bear the legend, required pursuant to Section 2.03, to the extent such Warrants are Restricted Securities.

Net Cash Amount
") equal to the sum of the Daily Net Cash Amounts for each Trading Day during the Settlement Period.
(b)
  
For purposes of determining the Net Cash Amount, the "
Daily Net Cash Amount
" means, in respect of each Capped Warrant and Uncapped Warrant held by a Warrantholder, and each Trading Day during the Settlement Period, an amount of cash (which will in no event be less than zero) equal to:

Section 3.03.
Settlement in Shares.
(a) If the Company elects to settle the Capped Warrants or the Uncapped Warrants solely in shares of Common Stock, each Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive from the Company, for each Warrant held by such Warrantholder, a "
Net Share Amount
" equal to the sum of the Daily Net Share Amounts for each Trading Day during the Settlement Period, together with cash for any fractional shares (calculated on an aggregate basis) valued at the VWAP on the last day of the Settlement Period.
(b)
  
For purposes of determining the Net Share Amount, the "
Daily Net Share Amount
" means, in respect of each Capped Warrant and Uncapped Warrant held by a Warrantholder, and each Trading Day during the Settlement Period, a number of shares of Common Stock (which will in no event be less than zero) equal to the Daily Net Cash Amount (calculated as described in Section 3.02) for such Trading Day divided by VWAP for such Trading Day.
Section 3.04
. Settlement in Cash and Shares
. If the Company elects to settle the Capped Warrants or the Uncapped Warrants in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at the time the Company gives notice of the settlement method pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(i), the Company will specify a percentage of the Daily Net Share Amount that will be settled in cash (the "
Cash Percentage
"). If the Company makes such an election, the amount of cash that it will deliver in respect of each Trading Day in the Settlement Period will equal the product of the Cash Percentage and the Daily Net Cash Amount for such Trading Day. The number of shares deliverable in respect of each Trading Day in the Settlement Period will be a percentage of the Daily Net Share Amount equal to 100% minus the Cash Percentage.
Section 3.05.
Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change.
(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Expiration Date, each Warrantholder will have the right to exercise its Warrants at any time on or after the effective date of such Fundamental Change (the "
Effective Date
") until the 30th Trading Day after the Effective Date. Following such 30th Trading Day, any unexercised Warrants will no longer be exercisable until the Expiration Date. The Company shall, on or prior to such 10th scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the anticipated Effective Date, issue a press release and notify all Warrantholders (with a copy to the Warrant Agent) of the anticipated Effective Date, their rights to exercise their Warrants as set forth in the Warrant Agreement, and whether the Company will settle Warrants tendered for exercise in cash or shares of its Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as set forth in this Section 3.05. In such press release and notice, the Company shall state that any Warrantholder whose Warrants are represented by Global Units must separate such Global Units into Global Warrants and Global Notes in order to exercise such Warrants in connection with a Fundamental Change. The Company shall deliver the same consideration for all Warrants of a particular type, but may settle the Capped Warrants and the
 
20
 
 
Uncapped Warrants for different consideration. Any such notice will be irrevocable.
(b)
  
Any Capped Warrants or Uncapped Warrants exercised in connection with a Fundamental Change during the time period set forth in Section 3.05(a) shall be settled by delivery of an amount of cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof (the "
Early Settlement Amount
"), at the Company's election as set forth in Section 3.05(a). The Early Settlement Amount will be determined by reference to the tables below and will be based on the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and the Stock Price in respect of such Fundamental Change.
(c)
     
(i)    If the Company elects to settle the Capped or the Uncapped Warrants in cash, the Early Settlement Amount for each Warrant shall be the amount determined by reference to the tables below.
(ii)
   
If the Company elects to settle the Capped or the Uncapped Warrants in shares of Common Stock, the Early Settlement Amount for each Warrant will be a number of shares (or, following the Effective Date, a number of Units of Reference Property (as set forth in Section 4.03 below)) equal to the amount determined by reference to the tables below divided by the Average Price for Common Stock or for Unit of Reference Property. If the Company elects to settle Warrants for a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, the Early Settlement Amount for each Warrant will be (a) an amount of cash equal to the Cash Percentage of the Early Settlement Amount elected by the Company, and (b) a number of shares of Common Stock (or, following the Effective Date, a number of Units of Reference Property) equal to the product of (i) 100% minus the Cash Percentage and (ii) the amount determined by reference to the tables below divided by the Average Price for Common Stock or for Unit of Reference Property. The "
Average Price
" means (i) with respect to the Common Stock, the average of the VWAP for the Common Stock, and (ii) with respect to a Unit of Reference Property, the average of the Unit Values, determined as set forth in Section 4.03, in each case for the 30-Trading Day Period commencing on the first Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date, as determined promptly by the Company following such 30th Trading Day.
(d)
 
The Company will deliver the Early Settlement Amount, whether in the form of cash, Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Average Price), or a combination thereof, on the third Business Day following
the 30-Trading Day period commencing on the first Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date, as determined promptly by the Company following such 30th Trading Day.

The exact Stock Price and Effective Date may not be set forth on the table above, in which case:
(i)
    
if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in such table, the Early Settlement Amount will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the Early Settlement Amount set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii)
  
if the Stock Price is in excess of $50 per share, subject to adjustment, the Early Settlement Amount shall be the applicable amount under the column for $50 per share (subject to adjustment) determined by a straight-line interpolation between the relevant Effective Dates if the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table based on a 365-day year; and

(i)
    
if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Early Settlement Amount will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the Early Settlement Amount set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii)
   
if the Stock Price is in excess of $50 per share, subject to adjustment, the Early Settlement Amount will be the sum of (A) the applicable amount under the column for $50 (subject to adjustment), and (B) the product of the Warrant Multiplier and the difference between the Stock Price and $50 (subject to adjustment) determined by a straight-line interpolation between the relevant Effective Dates if the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table based on a 365-day year; and
(iii)
 
if the Stock Price is less than $8.99 per share, subject to adjustment, no Early Settlement Amount will be paid.
(i)
   
In connection with a Fundamental Change as set forth above, Warrants may be exercised by (i) in the case of Certificated Warrants, surrendering the Warrant Certificate evidencing such Warrants at the principal office of the Warrant Agent (or successor warrant agent), with the Election to Exercise form set forth on the reverse of the Warrant Certificate duly completed and executed, together with any applicable transfer taxes as set forth in Section 3.06 below or (ii) in the case of Warrants represented by a Global Certificate registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee, complying with appropriate procedures established by the Depositary for the exercise of Warrants. The date on which a Warrantholder complies with the foregoing requirements for
 
23
 
 
exercise is the "
Exercise Date
" hereunder, unless such date is not a Trading Day or the Warrantholder satisfies the foregoing requirements after 5:00 p.m. New York City time on a Trading Day, in which case the Exercise Date shall be the immediately succeeding Trading Day, except that in no event shall an Exercise Date occur following the Expiration Date. A registered Warrantholder may exercise the full number of Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate or any number of whole Warrants thereof.
If the Company elects to settle payment of the Early Settlement Amount upon exercise of the Warrants as described above in shares of its Common Stock (or Units of Reference Property as described below) and such shares or units are "restricted securities" within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to register such shares or units to permit the prompt resale of such shares or units by the recipients thereof pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. If the Company fails to register such shares or units, no liquidated damages shall be paid or fees assessed.
Section 3.06
. Delivery of Common Stock.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 4.07 hereof, if the Company shall have elected to settle Warrants in Common Stock as set forth in Section 3.03 or 3.04 above, the Warrant Agent shall, on or prior to the date required as set forth above, (i) if shares of Common Stock are in book-entry form at the Depositary, deliver Common Stock by electronic transfer (with the assistance of the Company and the transfer agent of Common Stock, if necessary) to such Warrantholder's account, or any other account as the Warrantholder may designate, at the Depositary or at an Agent Member, or (ii) if shares of Common Stock are not in book-entry form at the Depositary, requisition from the transfer agent of the Common Stock and deliver to or upon the order of such registered Warrantholder a certificate or certificates, in each case with legends thereon as appropriate (as determined by the Company) and for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such Warrantholder is entitled, registered in such name or names as may be directed by such Warrantholder, in each case together with cash, as provided in Section 3.07 hereof, in respect of any fractional shares, and, if the number of Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate shall not have been exercised in full, a new Warrant Certificate, countersigned by the Warrant Agent (or successor warrant agent), for the balance of the number of whole Warrants represented by the surrendered Warrant Certificate;
provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer in connection with the issue of any Warrant Certificate in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant.
(b)
  
If the Company shall elect to settle the Warrants in shares of Common Stock, each Person in whose name any such certificate for shares of
 
24
 
 
Common Stock is issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares on the last Trading Day in the period used to determine the Average Price of the Common Stock, in the case of Warrants exercised in connection with a Fundamental Change, or on the last Trading Day of the Settlement Period, in the case of Warrants exercised on the Expiration Date, except that, if either such date is a date when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open.
(c)
  
Promptly after the Warrant Agent shall have taken the action required in above or at such later time as may be mutually agreeable to the Company and the Warrant Agent, the Warrant Agent shall account to the Company with respect to any Warrants exercised. The Company shall reimburse the Warrant Agent for any amounts paid by the Warrant Agent in respect of a fractional share upon such exercise in accordance with Section 3.07 hereof.
Section 3.07
. No Fractional Shares to Be Issued.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant Agreement, the Company shall not be required to issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock or to distribute stock certificates that evidence fractional shares of Common Stock or to issue a Warrant Certificate representing a fractional Warrant upon exercise of any Warrants. If more than one Warrant Certificate shall be surrendered for exercise at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrants so surrendered. If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would, except for the provisions of this Section 3.07, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant or Warrants, the Company shall pay the cash amount contemplated in Section 3.02. The Warrantholders, by their acceptance of the Warrant Certificates, expressly waive their right to receive any fraction of a share of Common Stock or a stock certificate representing a fraction of a share of Common Stock or Warrant Certificate representing a fractional Warrant upon exercise of any Warrant.
Section 3.08
. Acquisition of Warrants by the Company; Cancellation of Warrants.
The Company shall have the right, except as limited by law, to purchase or otherwise to acquire Warrants at such times, in such manner and for such consideration as it may deem appropriate and shall have agreed with the holder of such Warrants. The Warrant Agent shall cancel any Warrant Certificate delivered to it for exercise, in whole or in part, or delivered to it for transfer, exchange, substitution or cancellation and no Warrant Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Warrant Agreement. On request of the Company, the Warrant Agent shall destroy cancelled Warrant Certificates held by it and shall deliver its certificates of destruction to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of Warrants,
 
25
 
 
such acquisition shall not operate as a repurchase or termination of the right represented by such Warrants unless and until the Warrant Certificates evidencing such Warrants are surrendered to the Warrant Agent for cancellation.
Section 3.09.
Direction of Warrant Agent
. The Company shall be responsible for performing all calculations required in connection with the exercise and settlement of the Warrants and the delivery of cash and/or Common Stock as described in the Article 3. In connection therewith, the Company shall provide prompt written notice to the Warrant Agent of any amounts necessary for the exercise and settlement of the Warrants, including without limitation, the Net Cash Amount, the Net Share Amount and any Early Settlement Amount. Any cash or Common Stock to be delivered to the Warrantholders hereunder shall be delivered to the Warrant Agent no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the date such items are required to be delivered to the Warrantholders. The Warrant Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay in performing its duties hereunder caused by any failure or delay of the Company in providing such calculations or items to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or Units of Reference Property which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant, and it makes no representation with respect thereto. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or Units of Reference Property, or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article 3.
ARTICLE 4
ADJUSTMENTS
Section 4.01
. Adjustment of Exercise Price.
The Exercise Price and Cap Price for any Warrants shall be subject to adjustment (without duplication) upon the following events:
(a)
  
the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or subdivisions and combinations of Common Stock, in which event the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where:
 
26
 
 
 
(b)
   
the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants to purchase Common Stock for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants at less than the Current Market Price of Common Stock as of the announcement date for the issuance of such rights or warrants, in which event the Exercise Price and, in the case of the Capped Warrants, the Cap Price, will be adjusted based on the following formula (
provided
that the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration):
where:
 
27
 
 
 
provided
,
however
, that if such rights or warrants are exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain Triggering Events, then the Exercise Price and Cap Price will not be adjusted until such Triggering Events occur.
(c)
   
the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Company's capital stock (other than Common Stock) or evidence of the Company indebtedness, the Company assets or property (excluding (A) any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clause (a) or (b) above and (B) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash), in which event the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where:
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, the Exercise Price and Cap Price instead will be adjusted based on the following formula:
        
where:
 
28
 
 
 
(d)
   
dividends or other distributions consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, in which event the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where:
(e)
   
The Company or one or more of its subsidiaries makes purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration paid per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "
Offer Expiration Date
"), in which event the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where:
 
29
 
 
 
(f)
   
Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price and Cap Price, as described above, the Warrant Multiplier for each of the Capped Warrants and Uncapped Warrants in effect immediately following effectiveness of such adjustment will be the Warrant Multiplier in effect immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and (ii) the denominator of which is the Exercise Price in effect immediately following such adjustment.
(g)
  
To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon exercise of Warrants for Common Stock, each Warrantholder will receive, in addition to Common Stock (to the extent settled in Common Stock), the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any exercise, the rights have separated from Common Stock, in which case the Exercise Price and Cap Price will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed, to all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Company's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
(h)
  
Except as stated above, the Exercise Price, Cap Price and Warrant Multiplier will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing.
 
30
 
 
 
(i)
   
The Company may from time to time, to the extent permitted by law and subject to applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange, decrease the Exercise Price (but not the Cap Price), increase the Cap Price (but not the Exercise Price) and/or increase the Warrant Multiplier of the Warrants by any amount. In that case Warrantholders will be given at least 15 days notice of such increase or decrease. The Company may make such decreases to the Exercise Price (but not the Cap Price), in addition to those set forth above, as the Board of Directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
(j)
    
None of the Exercise Price, Cap Price or Warrant Multiplier will be adjusted:
(i)
    
upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii)
  
upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights or rights to purchase such Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
(iii)
 
upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Closing Date;
(iv)
 
for a change in par value or no par value of Common Stock; or
(v) for accumulated and unpaid dividends.
(k)
   
If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandons its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Exercise Price, Cap Price or Warrant Multiplier then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.
(l)
    
Whenever the Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier is adjusted, the Company shall (i) compute the Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier in accordance with this Section 4.01 and prepare and transmit to the Warrant Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth the
 
31
 
 
Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier, the method of calculation of the Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier (or if the Company is not aware of this occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Warrant Agent shall provide a written notice to the holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier was determined and setting forth the adjusted Exercise Price, the Cap Price or the Warrant Multiplier.
Section 4.02
. Adjustment of Warrant Multiplier.
Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 4.01 above, the Warrant Multiplier in effect prior to the effectiveness of such adjustment shall be adjusted to the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, obtained by (i) multiplying the Warrant Multiplier in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the Exercise Price in effect prior to such adjustment, and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Exercise Price.
Section 4.03
. Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of Common Stock.
(a) In the case of any recapitalization, reclassification or change of Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivision or combination), a consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company, a sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries substantially as an entirety, or any statutory share exchange, in each case as a result of which Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (the "
Reference Property
"), then, following the effective time of the transaction, (i) the Relevant Price used to determine the Net Cash Amount payable upon exercise of the Warrants on the Expiration Date will be based on the value, determined as set forth below, of the kind and amount of shares or stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive (such kind and amount of Reference Property per Share of Common Stock, a "
Unit of Reference Property
") upon such transaction and (ii) the Daily Net Share Amount used to determine the Net Share Amount payable if the Company elects to settle Warrants exercised on the Expiration Date in shares shall be, in respect of each Warrant and each Trading Day during the Settlement Period a number of Units of Reference Property (which will in no event be less than zero) equal to the Daily Net Cash Amount (calculated as described above) for such Trading Day divided by the Unit Value for such Trading Day. The Company shall pay cash for any fraction of a
 
32
 
 
Unit of Reference Property (calculated on an aggregate basis) valued at the Unit Value at the last day of the Settlement Period.
(b)
   
For the purpose of determining the Relevant Price, the value of a Unit of Reference Property (the "
Unit Value
") shall be determined as follows: (i) Any shares of common stock of the successor or purchasing corporation or any other corporation that are traded on a national or regional stock exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market included in such Unit of Reference Property shall be valued as if such shares were "Common Stock" using procedures set forth in the definition of "VWAP" in Section 1.01, provided that the Bloomberg page (or successor page) referred to in such definition shall be to the page for such other corporation; and
(ii)
   
Any other property (other than cash) included in such Unit of Reference Property shall be valued in good faith by the Board of Directors or by a New York Stock Exchange member firm selected by the Board of Directors.
(c)
   
In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Company will make adequate provision whereby the holders of the Warrants shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the Warrants, treated as a single class, shall be exercisable from and after the Effective Date of such transaction, subject to the Company's option to cash settle exercised Warrants. The determination: (i) will be made for all Warrantholders by holders representing a plurality of the Warrants participating in such determination, (ii) will be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common Stock are subject, including, but not limited to, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such transaction, and (iii) will be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earlier of: (a) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock, and (b) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. This provision does not limit the rights of holders or the Company's rights in the event of a Fundamental Change, including the holders' right to receive the Early Settlement Amount in connection with the exercise of their Warrants
Section 4.04
. Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.
(a) The Company may, without the consent of the Warrantholders, consolidate with, merge into or sell, lease or otherwise transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as an entirety to any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions provided that:
 
33
 
 
 
(i)
    
the successor assumes all the Company's obligations under this Warrant Agreement and the Warrants;
(ii)
  
if as a result of such transaction Warrants become exercisable for common stock or other securities issued by a third party, such third party fully and unconditionally guarantees all obligations of the issuer of Warrants or such successor under the Warrants and this Warrant Agreement; and
(iii)
 
an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the provisions of this Warrant Agreement, have been delivered to the Warrant Agent.
(b)
   
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon any such assumption by the successor corporation, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Warrants Issuer with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Warrants Issuer. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue any or all of the Warrants issuable pursuant to this Agreement which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Warrants Issuer; and, upon the order of such successor corporation, instead of the Warrants Issuer, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Warrant Agreement prescribed, the Warrant Agent shall authenticate and deliver, as applicable, any Warrants that previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Warrants Issuer to the Warrant Agent for authentication, and any Warrants which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Warrant Agent for such purpose.

. Covenant to Reserve Shares for Issuance on Exercise.
(a) The Board of Directors has authorized and will reserve for issuance such number of shares of Common Stock as the Board of Directors believes will be issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants for shares of Common Stock. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. If, at the time any Warrants are exercised, the Company does not have reserved for issuance the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Warrants, the Company shall settle such Warrants in cash, notwithstanding any notice by the Company to the contrary.
(b)
  
The Company agrees to authorize and direct its current and future transfer agents for the Common Stock and for any shares of the Company's Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any of Warrants at all times to reserve for issuance the number of shares of Common Stock specified in Section 4.05(a). The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to requisition from time to time
 
34
 
 
from any such transfer agent's stock certificates (or beneficial interests thereof) required to honor outstanding Warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Warrant Agreement, and the Company agrees to authorize and direct such transfer agents to comply with all such requests of the Warrant Agent and to otherwise comply with the Warrant Agent in connection with the delivery of Common Stock. In connection with any such requisition, the Warrant Agent shall provide such transfer agent with a requisition order in the form of
Exhibit C
(or as separately agreed between the Warrant Agent and the transfer agent). The Company will supply such transfer agents with duly executed stock certificates for such purposes and will provide or otherwise make available any cash or scrip which may be payable as provided in this Article 4. Promptly after the date of expiration of Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall certify to the Company the aggregate number of Warrants then outstanding, and thereafter no shares shall be required to be reserved in respect of such Warrants.
(c)
   
If permitted or required by the rules of any national securities exchange or over the counter market or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is listed at any time, if any, the Company shall cause to have listed or quoted all shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Capped or Uncapped Warrants on any such exchange or market.
Section 4.06
. Payment of Taxes on Stock Certificates Issued upon Exercise.
The initial issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of Warrants shall be made without charge to the exercising Warrantholders for any tax in respect of the issuance of such stock certificates, and such stock certificates shall be issued in the respective names of, or in such names as may be directed by, the exercising Warrantholders;
provided, however
, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such stock certificate, any Warrant Certificates or other securities in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Warrant Certificate surrendered upon exercise of the Warrant, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates or other securities unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Section 4.07
. Warrant Agent Not Responsible for Adjustments or Validity of Stock.
The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Warrantholder to determine whether any facts exist that may require an adjustment of the Exercise Price or Warrant Entitlement, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental agreement provided to be employed, in making the same. The Company shall be responsible for performing all calculations required under this Article 4 in connection with the (i) adjustment of the Exercise Price, the Cap Price and the Warrant Entitlement and
 
35
 
 
(ii) the identification of any Reference Property and the determination of the related Unit Values thereof. The Warrant Agent shall have no liability for any failure or delay in performing its duties hereunder caused by any failure or delay of the Company in providing such calculations to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or of any securities or property which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant or upon any adjustment pursuant to Article 4, and it makes no representation with respect thereto. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or scrip upon the surrender of any Warrant for the purpose of exercise or upon any adjustment pursuant to Article 4, or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article 4.
Section 4.08
. Statements on Warrants.
The form of Warrant Certificate need not be changed because of any adjustment made pursuant to this Article 4, and Warrant Certificates issued after such adjustment may state the same Exercise Price and the same number of shares of Common Stock as are stated in the Warrant Certificates initially issued pursuant to this Warrant Agreement. However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion (which shall be conclusive) make any change in the form of Warrant Certificate that it may deem appropriate and that does not materially adversely affect the interest of the Warrantholders; and any Warrant Certificates thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant Certificate or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

Section 5.02
. Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates.
(a) If any Warrant at any time is mutilated, defaced, lost, destroyed or stolen, then on the terms set forth in this Warrant Agreement, such Warrant may be replaced at the cost of the applicant (including legal fees of the Company) at the office of the Warrant Registrar. The applicant for a new Warrant shall, in the case of any mutilated or defaced Warrant, surrender such Warrant to the Warrant Registrar
 
36
 
 
and, in the case of any lost, destroyed or stolen Warrant, furnish evidence satisfactory to the Company of such loss, destruction or theft, and, in each case, furnish evidence satisfactory to the Company of the ownership and authenticity of the Warrant together with such indemnity as the Company may require. Any such new Warrant Certificate shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone. An applicant for such a substitute Warrant Certificate shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the Company or the Warrant Agent may prescribe. All Warrant Certificates shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the substitution for lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificates, and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the substitution for and replacement of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
(b)
   
Initially, the Warrant Agent will act as the Warrant Registrar and Warrants may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the Warrant Registrar with a written instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Registrar, duly executed by such Warrantholder or by such Warrantholder's attorney, duly authorized in writing. Such Warrantholder will also provide a written certificate (substantially in the form of
Exhibit B
hereto) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Warrants. The registered holder of a Warrant will be treated as its owner for all purposes.

If the office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint in writing a successor warrant agent in place of the Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 60 days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated warrant agent or by any holder of Warrants (who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant Certificate for inspect by the Company), then the holder of any Warrants may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor warrant agent.

40
 
 
give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of the appointment of the successor warrant agent.

The Letters of Credit.
(a)
General
. Citibank agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit (each, a "

Section 2.06.
Backstop Letter of Credit Adjustments.
(a)
Increase of Backstop Letter of Credit upon Issuance of or Increase of Available Amount of Letter of Credit.
In connection with any issuance of or increase in the Available Amount of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof, the Company may cause a Backstop L/C Issuer to increase the Available Amount of any outstanding Backstop Letter of Credit by causing the relevant Backstop L/C Issuer to deliver to Citibank an executed Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment in respect of such Backstop Letter of Credit, increasing the Available Amount thereof in an amount equal to the Adjusted Available Amount of the Letter of Credit being issued or amended as of such date, and Citibank shall, to the extent the conditions to issuance of such Letter of Credit are otherwise fulfilled, execute and deliver to the Backstop L/C Issuer such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment or otherwise consent in writing to such amendment, in accordance with the terms of such Backstop Letter of Credit.
(b)
          
Mandatory Increase of Backstop Letter of Credit.
At any time that the aggregate Available Amount of any one or more Letters of Credit (other than any Sterling Letter of Credit) exceeds the Available Amount of the Corresponding Backstop Letter of Credit outstanding in respect thereof, Citibank may require the Company to request that the Backstop L/C Issuer deliver to Citibank a Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment increasing the Available Amount of such Backstop Letter of Credit in an amount sufficient to cause the Available Amount thereof to equal the aggregate Adjusted Available Amount of such Letters of Credit as of such date (and
 
 
 
 
 
Citibank shall, upon receipt thereof from the Backstop L/C Issuer, execute and deliver such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment to the Backstop L/C Issuer or otherwise consent in writing to such amendment in accordance with the terms of such Backstop Letter of Credit). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment to the extent that there are amounts on deposit in any L/C Cash Deposit Account (other than the Sterling L/C Cash Deposit Account) such that the sum of (i) all amounts on deposit in all L/C Cash Deposit Accounts (other than the Sterling L/C Cash Deposit Account) and (ii) the aggregate Available Amount of all Backstop Letters of Credit (other than any Sterling Backstop Letter of Credit) at such time outstanding, would equal or exceed the aggregate Adjusted Available Amount (calculated, with respect to the Letter or Letters of Credit pertaining to such Corresponding Backstop Letter of Credit, as if each such Letter of Credit had been issued on such date) of all Letters of Credit (other than Sterling Letters of Credit) at such time outstanding. The Company may, at its option, make payment to Citibank for deposit in any L/C Cash Deposit Account (other than the Sterling L/C Cash Deposit Account) in an amount sufficient to cause the condition set forth in the preceding sentence to be true, and thereby to avoid an obligation to deliver a Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment hereunder. In the event that, within 7 Business Days after such request has been communicated to the Company, such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment shall not have been delivered to Citibank or such deposit to the appropriate L/C Cash Deposit Account shall not have been made, Citibank may, in accordance with and to the extent permitted under the terms of such Backstop Letter of Credit, draw the full Available Amount thereunder for deposit into the appropriate L/C Cash Deposit Account.
(c)
          
Decrease of Backstop Letter of Credit at the Company's Option.
At any time that the aggregate Adjusted Available Amount of all Letters of Credit covered by any single Corresponding Backstop Letter of Credit (calculated, for purposes of this Section 2.06(c), as if each such Letter of Credit had been issued on such date of determination) is less than the Available Amount of such Corresponding Backstop Letter of Credit by an amount at least equal to $500,000 or the Equivalent thereof in other currencies, the Company may request that the relevant Backstop L/C Issuer deliver to Citibank an executed Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment decreasing the Available Amount of such Backstop Letter of Credit in an amount sufficient to cause the Available Amount thereof to equal the aggregate Adjusted Available Amount of such Letters of Credit as of the date of such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment, and upon receipt thereof Citibank shall execute and deliver to the Backstop L/C Issuer such Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment or other written consent to such amendment in accordance with the terms of such Backstop Letter of Credit.
(d)
        
Issuance of or Increase in Backstop Letter of Credit at the Company's Option.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, at any time and from time to time at its option (whether in order to replace an outstanding Backstop Letter of Credit with another Backstop Letter of Credit issued by a different Backstop L/C Issuer, or to cause amounts on deposit in any L/C Cash Deposit Account to become available under Section 2.04(e) hereof, or otherwise), cause a Backstop L/C Issuer to issue a new Backstop Letter of Credit and/or to increase the Available Amount under any one or more outstanding Backstop Letters of Credit by delivering to Citibank an executed Backstop Letter of Credit Amendment in respect thereof, and Citibank shall upon receipt of any such Backstop Letter of Credit
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment execute and deliver the same to the Backstop L/C Issuer or otherwise consent in writing to such amendment in accordance with the terms of such Backstop Letter of Credit;
provided
that Citibank shall not be required to (but may in its discretion) accept Backstop Letters of Credit with an Available Amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the Letter of Credit Commitment.
Section 2.07.
Payments and Computations.
(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company shall make each payment hereunder not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to Citibank at its Payment Office in same day funds and without deduction, set off or counterclaim.
(b)
          
All computations of Letter of Credit fees shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such fees are payable.
(c)
          
Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.

,
however,
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse Citibank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by Citibank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or any failure to honor a Letter of Credit where Citibank is, under applicable law, required to honor it. The parties hereto expressly agree that, as long as Citibank has not acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct, Citibank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.

MS hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder with respect to each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under such Letter of Credit, irrespective of any claim as to such Letter of Credit's validity, regularity or enforceability or the lack of authority of MSCS to execute or deliver such Letter of Credit; or any change in or amendment to such Letter of Credit; or any waiver or consent by Citibank with respect to any provisions thereof; or the absence of any action to enforce such Letter of Credit, or the recovery of any judgment against MSCS or of any action to enforce a judgment against MSCS under the Letter of Credit; any similar circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor generally.
MS hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand on MSCS for payment or otherwise (except as provided hereinabove), filing of claims, requirement of a prior proceeding against MSCS and protest or notice, except as provided for in any Letter of Credit with respect to amounts payable by MSCS thereunder. If at any time payment under any Letter of Credit is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned by Citibank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of MSCS or MS or otherwise, MS's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon such restoration or return being made by Citibank.

[FORM OF OPINION OF
CLEARY GOTTLIEB STEEN & HAMILTON LLP]
[Effective Date]
Citibank, N.A.
Two Penns Way, Suite 200
New Castle, Delaware 19720
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
Company
"), in connection with that certain Letter of Credit Agreement dated as of [_______], 2006 (the "
Agreement
"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(e)(iii) of the Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Agreement).
Based on the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
1.
            
The Company has corporate power to enter into the Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.
            
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company.
3.
            
The performance by the Company of its obligations under the Agreement (a) does not require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States, the State of Delaware or the State of New York and (b) does not result in a violation of any applicable United States federal or New York State law or published rule or regulation or the Delaware General Corporation Law.
4.
            
The Agreement is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that each party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
We express no opinion as to the enforceability of Section 7.10 of the Agreement relating to currency indemnity.
We note that by statute New York provides that a judgment or decree rendered in a currency other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment or decree. There is no corresponding federal statute and no controlling federal court decision on this issue. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether a federal court would award a judgment in a currency other than Dollars or, if it did so, whether it would order conversion of the judgment into Dollars.
We note that the designation in Section 7.11(a) of the Agreement of the U.S. federal courts sitting in New York City as the venue for actions or proceedings relating to the Agreement is (notwithstanding the waiver in Section 7.11(b) of the Agreement) subject to the power of such federal court to transfer actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or to dismiss such actions or proceedings on the grounds that such a federal court is an inconvenient forum for such action or proceeding.
With respect to the first sentence of Section 7.11(a) of the Agreement, we express no opinion as to the subject matter jurisdiction of any United States federal court to adjudicate any action relating to the Agreement where jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1332 does not exist.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The opinion expressed in paragraph 3 above relates only to those laws, rules and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to general business entities with respect to performance of transactions of the type referred to in the Agreement.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States, but we express no opinion as to any state securities or Blue Sky laws or United States federal securities laws.
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be relied on or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may show this opinion to any governmental authority pursuant to requirements of applicable law or regulations. The opinions expressed herein are rendered on and as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you or any governmental authority or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

Letter of Credit Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(e)(iii) of the Letter of Credit Agreement dated as of [________], 2006 (the "
Agreement
"), between The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "
Company
") and Citibank, N.A.. Terms defined in the Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
I have acted as General Counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have examined the following documents:
(1)          An executed copy of the Agreement.
(2)
          
The documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement.
(3)
          
A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto (the "
Charter
").
(4)
          
A copy of the bylaws of the Company and all amendments thereto (the "
Bylaws
").
(5)
          
A certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, dated __________, 2006, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Company in that State.
In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and such other persons as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Agreement).
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
            
The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.
            
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any material contractual or legal restriction known to me contained in any material document to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.
3.
            
To the best of my knowledge, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any third party is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement.
4.
            
To the best of my knowledge, there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, except as disclosed in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the Effective Date, that are likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
With regard to clause (ii) of paragraph 2 above, I express no opinion as to whether the deposit of cash into any L/C Cash Deposit Account would be permissible under the applicable lien covenants (all of which permit the Company to create liens in an amount based on its consolidated net worth) at the time such cash is provided.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States.
I am furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may show this opinion to any governmental authority pursuant to requirements of applicable law or
 
 
 
 
 
regulations. The opinions expressed herein are, however, rendered on and as of the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to advise you or any governmental authority or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

FORM OF
 
GUARANTEE
 
[___], 2006
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen: In consideration of Beneficiary's agreement to issue letters of credit for the account of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. subject to the receipt of certain letters of credit issued by Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. (hereinafter "MSCS"), Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter "MS"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Beneficiary, with effect from the date hereof, the due and punctual payment of all amounts payable by MSCS under Letter of Credit No. [__] dated [__], (as amended from time to time, the "Letter of Credit") when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and giving effect to any applicable grace period. Upon failure of MSCS punctually to pay any such amounts, and upon written demand by Beneficiary to MS at its address set forth in the signature block of this Guarantee (or to such other address as MS may specify in writing), MS agrees to pay or cause to be paid such amounts in the same currency and the same payment office as provided in the applicable Letter of Credit; provided that delay by Beneficiary in giving such demand shall in no event affect MS's obligations under this Guarantee.
 
MS hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder with respect to each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under such Letter of Credit, irrespective of any claim as to such Letter of Credit's validity, regularity or enforceability or the lack of authority of MSCS to execute or deliver such Letter of Credit; or any change in or amendment to such Letter of Credit; or any waiver or consent by Beneficiary with respect to any provisions thereof; or the absence of any action to enforce such Letter of Credit, or the recovery of any judgment against MSCS or of any action to enforce a judgment against MSCS under the Letter of Credit; any similar circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor generally.
 
MS hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand on MSCS for payment or otherwise (except as provided hereinabove), filing of claims, requirement of a
 
D-1
 
 
prior proceeding against MSCS and protest or notice, except as provided for in any Letter of Credit with respect to amounts payable by MSCS thereunder. If at any time payment under any Letter of Credit is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned by Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of MSCS or MS or otherwise, MS's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon such restoration or return being made by Beneficiary.
 
MS represents to Beneficiary as of the date hereof:
 
1.
            
it is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has full power and legal right to execute and deliver this Guarantee and to perform the provisions of this Guarantee on its part to be performed;
 
2.
            
its execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any law, regulation or contractual restriction binding on it or its assets;
 
3.
            
all consents, authorizations, approvals and clearances (including, without limitation, any necessary exchange control approval) and notifications, reports and registrations requisite for its due execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been obtained from or, as the case may be, filed with the relevant governmental authorities having jurisdiction and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority having jurisdiction is required for such execution, delivery or performance; and
 
4.
            
this Guarantee is its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforcement hereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' right or by general equity principles.
 
By accepting this Guarantee, Beneficiary agrees that MS shall be subrogated to all rights of Beneficiary against MSCS in respect of any amounts paid by MS pursuant to this Guarantee with respect to any Letter of Credit, provided that MS shall be entitled to enforce or to receive any payment arising out of or based upon such right of subrogation only to the extent that it has paid all amounts payable by MSCS under such Letter of Credit.
 
This Guarantee shall expire on the [
earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination date of the applicable letter of credit
]. Such expiration or termination shall not, however, affect or reduce MS's obligation hereunder for any liability of
 
D-2
 
 
MSCS incurred with respect to transactions entered into by MSCS prior to such expiration or termination.
 
This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Letter of Credit.
