INTERPUBLIC ANNOUNCES OFFER TO EXCHANGE NEW FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2010 FOR UP TO $250 MILLION OF ITS FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2008
 
New York, NY (November 22, 2006)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) announced today that it has launched an offer to exchange up to $250 million principal amount of its new Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the "new notes") for the same principal amount of its old Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "old notes"). This exchange offer is being conducted only with qualified institutional buyers that currently hold the old notes and is exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offer will expire, unless extended by Interpublic, at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on December 21, 2006.
 
Interpublic is offering eligible holders $1,000 principal amount of its new notes for each $1,000 principal amount of its outstanding old notes, plus an early participation payment of $41.25 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of old notes exchanged. To be eligible to receive the early participation payment and for early settlement of their old notes, holders of old notes must validly tender and not subsequently validly withdraw their old notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 7, 2006, the early participation date. Holders that validly tender their old notes after the early participation date will not receive the early participation payment. Exchanging holders will also receive a cash payment in the amount of accrued but unpaid interest on their old notes up to, but not including, the initial settlement date. The initial settlement date, on which Interpublic will accept for settlement old notes that have been validly tendered and not subsequently validly withdrawn, will occur upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions to the initial acceptance of the old notes and will be on or after the early participation date.
 
Interest on the new notes will be payable quarterly in arrears beginning February 15, 2007. The new notes will differ from the old notes in that the new notes will (i) mature
 
 
 
in November 2010 (instead of July 2008), (ii) bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points (instead of three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points) and (iii) benefit from the terms of a registration rights agreement between Interpublic and the dealer manager for the exchange offer. The terms of the new notes are otherwise substantially identical to those of the old notes.
 
The holder of approximately 45% of the aggregate principal amount of old notes outstanding has agreed to tender its old notes pursuant to the exchange offer and not to withdraw those old notes so long as the exchange offer is not amended in an adverse manner.
 
# # #
 
The new notes have not been and, at the time of the closing of the transaction, will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. They may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to purchase any securities or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The exchange offers are being made only pursuant to an offering memorandum and related letter of transmittal and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as is permitted under applicable law.
