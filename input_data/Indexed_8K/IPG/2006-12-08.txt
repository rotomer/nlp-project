The disclosure under Item 2.03 of this report with respect to the entry into these agreements is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
On December 8, 2006, the Company retired $250 million of its Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "Old Notes") in connection with the exchange described in Item 2.03 of this report.
 
On December 8, 2006, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of the New Notes under the Indenture.
The New Notes were exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of the Company's Old Notes with certain qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The exchange was exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
For a comparison of the terms of the New Notes and the Old Notes, please refer to the press release announcing the receipt of tenders and acceptance for exchange of all the Old Notes, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The New Notes will mature on November 15, 2010 and will bear interest at a floating rate. The interest rate on the New Notes will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The New Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer as a result of the private placement.
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to allow holders of the New Notes to exchange these notes for an equal principal amount of notes with substantially identical terms, except that the notes issued in this exchange will be registered under the Securities Act.

(a)
          
To the extent not prohibited by any applicable law or applicable interpretation of the Staff of the SEC, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed an Exchange Offer Registration Statement covering the offer by the Company to the Holders to exchange all of the Registrable Securities for Exchange Securities not later than June 12, 2007 (the "
Filing Deadline
"), to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be declared effective not later than 120 days after the Filing Deadline and to have such Exchange Offer Registration Statement remain effective until the closing of the Exchange Offer. The Company shall commence the Exchange Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the
 
 
 
 
Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC and use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Exchange Offer consummated within 150 days after the Filing Deadline.
The Company shall commence the Exchange Offer by mailing the related Prospectus and accompanying documents to each Holder stating, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by applicable law:
(i)
           
that the Exchange Offer is being made pursuant to this Registration Rights Agreement and that all Registrable Securities validly tendered will be accepted for exchange;
(ii)
          
the dates of acceptance for exchange (which shall be a period of at least 20 business days and not more than 40 business days, or longer if required by applicable law, from the date such notice is mailed) (the "
Exchange Dates
");
(iii)
        
that any Registrable Security not tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest, but will not retain any rights under this Registration Rights Agreement;
(iv)
         
that Holders electing to have a Registrable Security exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be required to surrender such Registrable Security, together with the enclosed letters of transmittal, to the institution and at the address (located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York) specified in the notice, or effect such exchange otherwise in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for such Registrable Security, in each case prior to the close of business on the last Exchange Date; and
(v)
          
that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election, not later than the close of business, New York City time, on the last Exchange Date, by sending to the institution and at the address (located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York) specified in the notice a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Securities exchanged or effecting such withdrawal in compliance with the applicable procedures of the depositary for the Registrable Securities.
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Company shall:
(i)
           
accept for exchange Registrable Securities or portions thereof tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and
(ii)
          
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the Company and issue, and cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder, an Exchange Security equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities surrendered by such Holder.
 
 
 
 
 
Interest on each Exchange Security will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Securities, from the date of original issuance of the Securities on the date hereof.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the Staff of the SEC. The Company shall inform the Dealer Manager of the names and addresses of the Holders to whom the Exchange Offer is made, and the Dealer Manager shall have the right, subject to applicable law, to contact such Holders and otherwise facilitate the tender of Registrable Securities in the Exchange Offer.
(b)
          
In the event that (i) the Company determines upon the advice of the Company's outside counsel that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be consummated as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate applicable law or the applicable interpretations of the Staff of the SEC, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason consummated within 150 days after the Filing Deadline (the "
Exchange Offer Consummation Deadline
") or (iii) any Holder notifies the Company that it is not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as promptly as practicable after such determination, date or notice of such opinion of counsel is given to the Company (but no later than the Filing Date), as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale by the Holders of all of the Registrable Securities and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within 120 days after the Filing Date. In the event the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement solely as a result of the matters referred to in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file and have declared effective by the SEC both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Holders after completion of the Exchange Offer. Subject to the Company's right to suspend the use of the Shelf Registration Statement during the Suspension Period (as defined in Section 3), the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier of (i) the second anniversary date of the Shelf Registration Statement and (ii) such time as all of the Securities cease to be outstanding or have either been (A) sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or (B) sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act under circumstances in which any legend borne by the Securities relating to restrictions on transferability thereof is removed and such Securities are eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k), or any successor provision, of the 1933 Act (the
Shelf Registration Effectiveness Period
"). The Company further agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the 1933 Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration or if reasonably requested by a Holder with respect
 
 
 
 
to information relating to such Holder, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective and such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
(c)
          
The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b). Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d)
          
An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof or a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the 1933 Act;
provided
,
however
, that, if, after it has been declared effective or becomes automatically effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Registration Statement will be deemed not to have become effective during the period of such interference until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement may legally resume. As provided for in the Indenture, in the event the Exchange Offer is not consummated and the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective as set forth below, then the interest rate on the Securities will be increased (the "
Additional Interest
") as follows:
(i)
           
if (A) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Deadline or (B) the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement and such Shelf Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date applicable thereto then, commencing on the day after the Filing Deadline in the case of Clause (A) or the Filing Date in the case of Clause (B), Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Registrable Securities at a rate of .25% per annum for the first 90 days immediately following thereafter, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional .25% per annum after the first 90 days; or
(ii)
          
if (A) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 120 days after the Filing Deadline or (B) the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement and such Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 120 days following the Filing Date applicable thereto then, commencing on the 121st day in the case of Clause (A) or such 121st day following the Filing Date in the case of Clause (B), Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Registrable Securities at a rate of .25% per annum for the first 90 days immediately following thereafter, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional .25% per annum after the first 90 days; or
(iii)
        
if (A) the Company has not exchanged Exchange Securities for all Securities validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer on or prior to the Exchange Offer Consummation Deadline, (B) if applicable, the Shelf
 
 
 
 
Registration Statement has been declared effective and such Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective or usable during the Shelf Registration Effectiveness Period that exceeds the Suspension Period (as defined in Section 3) or (C) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective or usable prior to the consummation of the Exchange Offer, then Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Registrable Securities at a rate of .25% per annum for the first 90 days commencing on the day after the Exchange Offer Consummation Deadline in the case of Clause (A) or the day such Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement ceases to be effective in the case of Clauses (B) and (C), as applicable, and such Additional Interest rate shall increase by an additional .25% per annum after the first 90 days (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, so long as any Securities not registered under an Exchange Offer Registration Statement are then covered by an effective Shelf Registration, no Additional Interest shall accrue on such Securities);
provided
,
however
, that the Additional Interest rate on the Securities may not exceed in the aggregate 0.5% per annum;
provided
further
,
however
, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Additional Interest under more than one of the clauses in this Section 2(d) at any one time;
provided
further
,
however
, that (1) upon the filing of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in the case of Clause (i)(A) above) or a Shelf Registration Statement (in the case of Clause (i)(B) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration (in the case of Clause (ii)(A) above) or a Shelf Registration Statement (in the case of Clause (ii)(B) above), or (3) upon the exchange of Exchange Securities for all Securities tendered or the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement (in the case of Clause (iii)(A) above), or upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of Clause (iii)(B) above or Clause (iii)(C) above), Additional Interest on the Securities as a result of such clause (or the relevant subclause thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue.
(e)
          
The Dealer Manager and the Trustee shall be entitled, on behalf of the Holders, to seek any available remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the sole monetary damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Additional Interest shall be as set forth in this Section 2(d). Nothing shall preclude the Dealer Manager and the Holders from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to this Agreement.
(f)
           
The Company represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus that may conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement.
In connection with the obligations of the Company with respect to the Registration Statements pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Company shall as expeditiously as possible:
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
          
prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate form under the 1933 Act, which form (x) shall be selected by the Company and (y) shall, in the case of a Shelf Registration, be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the selling Holders thereof and (z) shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective in accordance with Section 2 hereof;
(b)
          
prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the applicable period and cause each Prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act; to keep each Prospectus current during the period described under Section 4(3) and Rule 174 under the 1933 Act that is applicable to transactions by brokers or dealers with respect to the Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities;

in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities, to counsel for the Dealer Manager, to counsel for the Holders and to each Underwriter of an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any, without charge, as many copies of each Prospectus, including each preliminary Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto and such other documents as such Holder or Underwriter may reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities; and the Company consents to the use of such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law by each of the selling Holders of Registrable Securities and any such Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by and in the manner described in such Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law;
(d)
          
use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities under all applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement shall reasonably request in writing by the time the applicable Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, to cooperate with such Holders in connection with any filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Holder to consummate the disposition in each such jurisdiction of such Registrable Securities owned by such Holder;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (ii) file any general consent to service of process or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not so subject;
(e)
          
in the case of a Shelf Registration, notify each Holder of Registrable Securities, counsel for the Holders and counsel for the Dealer Manager promptly and, if
 
 
 
 
requested by any such Holder or counsel, confirm such advice in writing (i) when a Registration Statement has become effective and when any post-effective amendment thereto has been filed and becomes effective and when any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement and Prospectus or for additional information after the Registration Statement has become effective, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, including the receipt by the Company of any notice of objection of the SEC to the use of a Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the 1933 Act, (iv) if, between the effective date of a Registration Statement and the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities covered thereby, the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any underwriting agreement, securities sales agreement or other similar agreement, if any, relating to the offering cease to be true and correct in all material respects or if the Company receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event during the period a Shelf Registration Statement is effective which makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading and (vi) of any determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus would be appropriate;
(f)
           
make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or, in the case of a Shelf Registration, the resolution of any objection of the SEC pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the 1933 Act, including by filing an amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement on the proper form, at the earliest possible moment and provide immediate notice to each Holder of the withdrawal of any such order;

(i)

with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available) to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the Company agrees to notify the Holders to suspend use of the Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and the Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the Company has amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission;
(j)

TIA
"), in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA and execute, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;
(m)
         
in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable Securities, any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, and attorneys and accountants designated by the Holders, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all financial and other records, pertinent documents and properties of the Company, and cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company to supply all
 
 
 
 
information reasonably requested by any such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement;
(n)
          
in the case of a Shelf Registration, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed if requested by the Majority Holders, to the extent such Registrable Securities satisfy applicable listing requirements;
(o)
          
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Securities to continue to be rated by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (as such term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the 1933 Act), if the Registrable Securities have been rated;
(p)
          
if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement, (i) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and (ii) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such filing; and
(q)
          
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and in the case of a Shelf Registration, make generally available to its securityholders earning statements (which need not be audited) satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the 1933 Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company commencing after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods.
(r)
           
in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (i) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same in writing if and when requested, (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (iii) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company, or
 
 
 
 
of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement.
In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(e)(v) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(i) hereof, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at its expense) all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. If the Company shall give any such notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company shall extend the period during which the Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company may give any such notice of suspension that may not exceed 120 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period (the "
Suspension Period
").
The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers (the "
Underwriters
") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.
(a)
          
The Staff of the SEC has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "
Participating Broker-Dealer
"), may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the 1933 Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the 1933 Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company understands that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the 1933 Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the 1933 Act.
(b)
          
In light of the above, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the provisions of this Agreement as they relate to a Shelf Registration shall also apply to an Exchange Offer Registration to the extent, and with such reasonable modifications thereto as may be, reasonably requested by the Dealer Manager or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in each case as provided in clause (ii) below, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above;
provided
that:
(i)
           
the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as would otherwise be contemplated by Section 3(i), for a period exceeding 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of this Agreement) and Participating Broker-Dealers shall not be authorized by the Company to deliver and shall not deliver such Prospectus after such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4; and
(ii)
          
the application of the Shelf Registration procedures set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement to an Exchange Offer Registration, to the extent not required by the positions of the Staff of the SEC or the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, will be in conformity with the reasonable request to the Company by the Dealer Manager or with the reasonable request in writing to the Company by one or more broker-dealers who certify to the Dealer Manager and the Company in writing that they anticipate that they will be Participating Broker-Dealers; and
provided
further
that, in connection with such application of the Shelf Registration procedures set forth in Section 3 to an Exchange Offer Registration, the Company shall be obligated (x) to deal only with one entity representing the Participating Broker-Dealers, which shall be J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. unless it elects not to act as such representative, (y) to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of only one counsel representing the Participating Broker-Dealers, which shall be counsel to the Dealer Manager unless such counsel elects not to so act and (z) to cause to be delivered only one, if any, "comfort" letter with respect to the Prospectus in the form existing on the last Exchange Date and with respect to each subsequent amendment or supplement, if any, effected during the period specified in clause (i) above.
(c)
          
The Dealer Manager shall have no liability to the Company or any Holder with respect to any request that it may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
          
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer Manager, each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Dealer Manager or any Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or is under common control with, or is controlled by, any Dealer Manager or any Holder, from and against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Dealer Manager, any Holder or any such controlling or affiliated Person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), any Free Writing Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any "issuer information" ("
Issuer Information
") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Dealer Manager or any Holder furnished to the Company in writing by the Dealer Manager or any selling Holder expressly for use therein;
provided
,
however
, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any Prospectus relating to a Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that a Prospectus relating to such Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer under the 1933 Act in accordance with applicable law in connection with such purchase and any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer result from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person if required by law, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b)
          
Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Dealer Manager and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Dealer Manager and any other selling Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the same extent as the
 
 
 
 
foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Dealer Manager and the Holders, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any Free Writing Prospectus or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above, such Person (the "
indemnified party
") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
indemnifying party
") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, (b) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Dealer Manager and all Persons, if any, who control the Dealer Manager within the meaning of either such Section and (c) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Holders and all Persons, if any, who control any Holders within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In such case involving the Holders and such Persons who control Holders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders. In such case involving the Company and such Persons who control the Company, such firm shall be designated by the Company, and in such case involving the Dealer Manager and such Persons who control the Dealer Manager, such firm shall be designated by the Dealer Manager. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is
 
 
 
 
or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Holders shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder that were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement.
(e)
          
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by
pro
rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which Registrable Securities were sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Dealer Manager, any Holder or any Person controlling any Dealer Manager or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
          
No Inconsistent Agreements
. The Company has not entered into, and on or after the date of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's other issued and outstanding securities under any such agreements.
(b)
          
Amendments and Waivers
. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written consent of Majority Holders affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent;
provided
,
however
, that no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 5 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder.
(c)
          
Notices
. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c), which address initially is, with respect to the Dealer Manager, the address set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement; and (ii) if to the Company, initially at the Company's address set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c).
All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next business day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.
Copies of all such notices, demands, or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture.
(d)
          
Successors and Assigns
. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders;
provided
that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.
 
 
 
 
The Dealer Manager (in its capacity as Dealer Manager) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.
(e)

INTERPUBLIC ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF TENDERS AND ACCEPTANCE FOR EXCHANGE OF ALL OF ITS FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2008 IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2010
 
New York, NY (December 8, 2006)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) announced today that it has received tenders of $250 million aggregate principal amount representing all of its outstanding Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "old notes") in connection with its previously announced offer to exchange the old notes for its new Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the "new notes"). Pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer, Interpublic has accepted the entire principal amount of old notes tendered for early settlement. Settlement is expected to occur later today, December 8, 2006. The exchange offer was conducted on a private basis in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with qualified institutional buyers.
 
Interpublic offered eligible holders $1,000 principal amount of its new notes for each $1,000 principal amount of its outstanding old notes, plus an early participation payment of $41.25 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of old notes exchanged. Exchanging holders will also receive a cash payment in the amount of accrued but unpaid interest on their old notes up to, but not including, the settlement date.
 
The main differences between the new notes and the old notes are that the new notes will (i) mature in November 2010 (instead of July 2008), (ii) bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points (instead of three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points) and (iii) benefit from the terms of a registration rights agreement between Interpublic and the dealer manager for the exchange offer. The new notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer as a result of the private placement.

They may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
