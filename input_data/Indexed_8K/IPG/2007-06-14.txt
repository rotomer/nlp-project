The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company") announced a development in the investigation being conducted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission into the Company's restatements announced in 2002 and 2005. As the Company has previously disclosed, it has been cooperating fully with the investigation since its inception.
The staff has informed the Company that it intends to seek approval from the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with the Company and, failing a settlement, to commence an action charging the Company with various violations of the federal securities laws. In that connection, the staff has sent to the Company a "Wells notice," which invites the Company to make a responsive submission before the staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the Commission. The Company understands that, under recently revised settlement procedures, the Commission's authorization to settle includes authorization to litigate if settlement fails, so the issuance of a Wells notice is now a prerequisite to settlement negotiations with the Commission staff.
The Company expects to discuss settlement with the staff once the Commission authorizes the staff to engage in such discussions and believes that the issuance of the notice represents a step towards concluding this matter. The Company cannot at this time predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations.
