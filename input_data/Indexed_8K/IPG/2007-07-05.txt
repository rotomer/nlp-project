Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On June 29, 2007, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc (the "Company") completed the acquisition of the remaining capital stock of Lintas India Private Limited ("Lintas"). Prior to the acquisition the Company owned 49% of the capital stock, so Lintas is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The stock was acquired from Lintas employees' trusts and the cost of the acquisition, which was calculated based on current results and applicable market multiples, is approximately $50 million in cash.
     We plan to file financial statements of Lintas and the Company as required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K Financial Statements and Exhibits within the applicable period.
