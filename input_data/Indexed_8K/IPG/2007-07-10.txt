Item 5.02.   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 6, 2007, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company") completed steps to implement its new Executive Severance Plan ("ESP") with respect to the Company's named executive officers. As previously disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 25, 2007, in 2006 the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved the ESP to provide severance benefits in certain situations to named executive officers and other senior executives. The ESP, as implemented, is intended to be consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the final rules thereunder, issued by the IRS in April 2007. Under the ESP, severance benefits will be provided if the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or the executive resigns with good reason. The ESP as adopted implements the previous action of the C ompensation Committee to provide for the following severance periods (during which a participant continues to receive his base salary and medical benefits) for the Company's named executive officers: Michael Roth, 24 months base salary; Frank Mergenthaler, 18 months; John Dooner, 18 months; Stephen Gatfield, 18 months; Philippe Krakowsky, 18 months; and Timothy Sompolski, 18 months. These severance periods will apply unless a longer severance period is provided for in the individual's employment agreement.
