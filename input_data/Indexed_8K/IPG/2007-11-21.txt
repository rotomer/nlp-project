The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the following agreements:
The disclosure under Item 2.03 of this report with respect to the entry into, and the provisions of, these agreements is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
On November 20, 2007, the Company retired $200 million of its 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Old Notes") in connection with the exchange described in Item 2.03 of this report.
On November 20, 2007, the Company issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of the New Notes under the Indenture.
The New Notes were exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of the Company's Old Notes with certain qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The exchange was exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
For a comparison of the terms of the New Notes and the Old Notes, please refer to the Company's press release announcing the completion of the exchange, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein.
The New Notes are convertible into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment in specified circumstances, including any payment of cash dividends on the Company's common stock. The New Notes are convertible at any time if the average price of the Company's common stock for 20 trading days immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or equal to a specified percentage of the conversion price, beginning at 118% and declining 0.5% on March 13 of each year until it reaches 110% at maturity. They are also convertible, regardless of the price of the Company's common stock, if: (i) the Company calls the New Notes for redemption; (ii) the Company makes specified distributions to shareholders; (iii) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which its common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities); or (iv) the credit ratings assigned to the New Notes by any two of Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings are lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the New Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services. Because of
 
 
 
 
the Company's current credit ratings, the New Notes are currently convertible. The New Notes are also convertible, whether or not the above conditions are met, from February 15 to March 15, 2023.
Holders of the New Notes may require the Company to repurchase the New Notes on March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018 for cash or Company common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at the Company's election. Additionally, investors may require the Company to repurchase the New Notes in the event of certain change of control events that occur prior to March 15, 2013, for cash or Company common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at the Company's election. At its option, the Company may redeem the New Notes on or after March 15, 2013 for cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The New Notes also provide for a "make-whole" adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions.
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act for the resale of the New Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the New Notes.
 
On November 20, 2007, the Company issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of the New Notes in exchange for the same aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes in a private offering in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The disclosure in Item 2.03 of this report is incorporated by reference in this Item 3.02.
 
On November 15, 2007, the Company issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein, announcing the exchange. On November 20, 2007, the Company issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein, announcing the completion of the exchange.

The Trustee will make such selection promptly following receipt of the notice of redemption from the Company provided pursuant to Section 2.02(4).
(3)
   
Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed
. If any Notes selected for partial redemption are thereafter surrendered for conversion in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Notes so selected, the converted portion of such Notes shall be deemed (so far as may be), solely for purposes of determining the aggregate Principal Amount of Notes to be redeemed by the Company, to be the portion selected for redemption. Notes which have been converted during a selection of Notes to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Nothing in this Section 2.02(3) shall affect the right of any Holder to convert any Notes pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.08 before the termination of the conversion right with respect thereto.
(4)

(g)
   
that Holders who wish to convert Notes must comply with the procedures in paragraph 9 of the Notes;
(h)
   
that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Redemption Price, interest, if any, on the Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent of the Notes;
(i)
    
if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the certificate number and the Principal Amounts of the particular Notes to be redeemed; and
(j)

At the Company's request, made at least five Business Days prior to the date upon which such notice is to be mailed, the Paying Agent shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense.
(5)
   
Effect of Notice of Redemption
. Once notice of redemption is mailed, Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price, except for Notes that are converted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.08. Upon presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent, Notes called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price as defined in paragraph 5 of the Notes.

(7)

The Trustee and Paying Agent shall, as promptly as practicable, return to the Company any money not required for that purpose because of conversion of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.08. If such money is then held by the Company or a Subsidiary in trust and is not required for such purpose, it shall be discharged from such trust.
The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of the Redemption Price and shall notify the Trustee of any
 
 
 
 
default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.

If a Fundamental Change shall occur at any time prior to March 15, 2013, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase any or all of such Holder's Notes no later than the date that is 35 Business Days after the date of the Company Notice of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change (subject to extension to comply with applicable law, as provided in Section 2.05(4)) (the "
Fundamental Change Purchase Date
"). The Notes shall be repurchased in integral multiples of $1,000 of the Principal Amount. The Company shall purchase such Notes at a price (the "

Fundamental Change Purchase Notice
") in the form entitled "Form of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice" on the reverse thereof duly completed, on or before the 35 day after the date of the Company Notice of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change, subject to extension to comply with applicable law.

that such Notes shall be purchased as of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in paragraph 7 of the Notes and in this Supplemental Indenture; and
 
 
 
 
(d)
   
if the Company elects, pursuant to a Company Notice, to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, in whole or in part, in Common Stock but such portion of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price shall ultimately be payable to such Holder in Cash because any of the conditions to the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price in Common Stock are not satisfied prior to or on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as set forth herein, whether such Holder elects (x) to withdraw such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice as to some or all of the Notes to which such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice relates (stating the Principal Amount and certificate numbers of the Notes as to which such withdrawal shall relate), or (y) to receive Cash in respect of the entire Fundamental Change Purchase Price for all Notes (or portions thereof) to which such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice relates. If a Holder, in such Holder's Fundamental Change Purchase Notice (and in any written notice of withdrawal of a portion of a Holder's Notes previously submitted for purchase pursuant to a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, the portion that remains subject to the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice), fails to indicate such Holder's choice with respect to the foregoing election, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive Cash in respect of all Notes subject to such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice in the circumstances described in the preceding sentence.
(3)
   
Procedures
. The Company shall purchase from a Holder, pursuant to this Section 2.03, Notes if the Principal Amount of such Notes is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000 if so requested by such Holder.
Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.03 shall be consummated by the delivery of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price to be received by the Holder promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Notes.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice contemplated by this Section 2.03 shall have the right at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date to withdraw such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice (in whole or in part) by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 2.05(2).
The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof.
On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) Cash or Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Fundamental Change Purchase Price of the Notes to be purchased pursuant to this Section 2.03. Payment by the Paying Agent of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price for such Notes shall be made promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of such Notes. If the Company is delivering Common Stock, the Company shall deliver to each Holder entitled to receive Common Stock, through the Paying Agent, a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock, as applicable, issuable in payment of such Fundamental Change Purchase Price and Cash in lieu of any fractional interests. The Person in whose name the certificate for
 
 
 
 
Common Stock is registered shall be treated as a holder of record following the Fundamental Change Purchase Date. Subject to Section 2.07 herein, no payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on the Common Stock the record date for which occurred on or prior to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, Cash or Common Stock sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of such Notes on the Business Day following the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, then, on and after such Fundamental Change Purchase Date, such Notes shall cease to be outstanding and interest on such Notes shall cease to accrue, whether or not book-entry transfer of such Notes is made or such Notes are delivered to the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Purchase Price upon delivery or transfer of the Notes). If a Holder is paid in Common Stock, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on such issue of shares of Common Stock. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Paying Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Paying Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law.
The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all Cash or Common Stock held by the Paying Agent for the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the Cash and Common Stock held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to deliver all Cash or Common Stock held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the Cash or Common Stock delivered to the Trustee.
All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any Notes for redemption shall be determined by the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding.

However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Paying Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Paying Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law.

Officers' Certificate

whether the Company desires the Trustee to give the Company Notice required by Section 2.05(1) herein.
(8)
   
Fractional Shares
. The Company shall not issue a fractional share of Common Stock in payment of the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price. Instead the Company shall pay Cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fraction of a share shall be determined by multiplying the Market Price by such fraction and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. It is understood that if a Holder elects to have
 
 
 
 
more than one Note purchased, the number of shares of Common Stock shall be based on the aggregate amount of Notes to be purchased.

(d)
   
any necessary qualification or registration under applicable state securities laws or the availability of an exemption from such qualification and registration; and

provided
, that at the Company's option, the matters to be addressed in such Officers' Certificate may be divided among two such certificates) and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that (i) the terms of the issuance of the Common Stock are in conformity with this Supplemental Indenture and (ii) the shares of Common Stock to be issued by the Company in payment of the specified percentage of the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price in respect of Notes have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered pursuant to the terms of this Supplemental Indenture in payment of the specified percentage of the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price in respect of Notes, shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, free from preemptive rights, and in the case of such Officers' Certificate, stating that conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d) above have been satisfied and, in the case of such Opinion of Counsel, stating that conditions (c) and (d) above have been satisfied.

Purchase Date pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 2.04 herein through the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay the entire Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price in respect of such Notes of such Holder or Holders in Cash. The Company shall not change the form or components or percentages of components of consideration to be paid for the Notes once it has given the Company Notice, except as described in the previous sentence.
(10)
        
Public Notice
.

SECTION 2.06.
      
Conversion of Notes
.
(1)
   
Right to Convert
. A Holder may convert its Notes for Common Stock at any time during which the conditions stated in paragraph 9 of the Notes are met. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Note per $1,000 Principal Amount (the "
Conversion Rate
") shall be that set forth in paragraph 9 in the Notes, subject to adjustment as herein set forth.
A Holder may convert a portion of the Principal Amount of Notes if the portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000.
(2)
   
Conversion Procedures
. To convert Notes, a Holder must satisfy the requirements in paragraph 9 of the Notes. The date on which the Holder satisfies all those requirements is the conversion date (the "
Conversion Date
"). As soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth Business Day following the Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion and cash in lieu of any fractional share determined pursuant to Section 2.06(3). The Person in whose name the certificate is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date;
provided
,
however
, that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes.
No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on or other distributions with respect to any Common Stock except as provided in Section 2.07 or as otherwise provided in this Indenture.
On conversion of Notes, that portion of accrued interest with respect to the converted Notes shall not be canceled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be
 
 
 
 
paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for interest accrued and unpaid through the Conversion Date, and the balance, if any, of such Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for the Principal Amount of the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
If a Holder converts more than one Note at the same time, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total Principal Amount of the Notes converted.
Upon surrender of a Note that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in Principal Amount to the unconverted portion of the Note surrendered.
If the last day on which Notes may be converted is a legal holiday in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Notes may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding day that it is not a legal holiday.
(3)
   
Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares
. The Company shall not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead the Company shall deliver cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share by multiplying the Sale Price of a full share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent.

Taxes on Conversion
. If a Holder converts Notes, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any withholding tax required by law.
(5)
   
Covenants of the Company
. The Company shall, prior to issuance of any Notes hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of the Notes.
All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
 
 
 
 
The Company shall endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the order and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Notes, if any, and shall cause to have listed or quoted all such shares of Common Stock on each United States national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
SECTION 2.07.
      
Adjustments to Conversion Rate
. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
(1)
   
In case the Company shall (a) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, exclusively in shares of its Common Stock or other capital stock, on its Common Stock; (b) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares; (c) combine its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; or (d) reclassify its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the effective date for the adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.07(1), as described below, shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any Notes thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which such Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such Notes been converted immediately prior to such effective date. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in clause (a) above is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2.07(1) shall become effective immediately after the applicable Record Date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective immediately after the applicable effective date in the case of subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Company's Common Stock.
(2)
   
In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of issuance of such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less than the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such Record Date shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such Record Date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such Market Price. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled
 
 
 
 
to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(3)
   
In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock (excluding any distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary) any evidences of its indebtedness or assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those referred to in Section 2.07(2) or (4) hereof) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 2.07(3) called the "
Distributed Assets or Securities
") in an aggregate amount that, combined together with the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.07(3) has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Market Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration of such distribution and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the Conversion Rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date mentioned below by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date, and the denominator shall be the Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date less the Fair Market Value on such Record Date (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a certificate filed with the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution;
provided
,
however
, that, if (a) the Fair Market Value of the portion of the Distributed Assets or Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Market Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date or (b) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date is greater than the Fair Market Value of such Distributed Assets or Securities by less than $1.00, then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of assets, debt securities, or rights, warrants or options the Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Notes immediately prior to such Record Date. In the event that such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
(4)
   
In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of outstanding shares of its Common Stock distributions consisting of Cash, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution by a fraction of which: (A) the numerator shall be the Market Price per share of Common Stock on such Record Date, and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Market Price per share of Common Stock on such Record Date less the amount per share of such
 
 
 
 
distribution. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such distribution.
(5)
   
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 2.07(2), (3) or (4), no adjustment shall be made thereunder for any distribution described therein if the Company makes proper provision so that each Holder who converts its Notes (or any portion thereof) after the Record Date for such distribution shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the amount and kind of assets or securities that such Holder would have been entitled to receive if such Holder had, immediately prior to such Record Date, converted such Notes for Common Stock;
provided
that, with respect to any Distributed Assets or Securities that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, the foregoing provision shall only apply to the extent (and so long as) the Distributed Assets or Securities receivable upon conversion of such Notes would be convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 60 days following conversion of such Notes.
(6)
   
Upon conversion of the Notes, the Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company implements (notwithstanding the occurrence of an event causing such rights to separate from the Common Stock at or prior to the time of conversion). No adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be made in connection with such stockholder rights plans.
(7)
   
For purposes of this Section 2.07, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
SECTION 2.08.     
Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Conversion
(1)
   
Calculation Methodology
. No adjustment in the Conversion Price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price then in effect
provided
that any adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except as stated in Section 2.07, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. Any adjustments that are made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under Sections 2.06, 2.07 and this Section 2.08 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share, as the case may be.
(2)
   
When No Adjustment Required
. No adjustment to the Conversion Price need be made:
(a)
   
 
upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the
 
 
 
 
 
Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(b)   upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c)   upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(d)   for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
(e)   for accrued and unpaid interest.
To the extent the Notes become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than capital stock of the Company), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities. Interest shall not accrue on such cash.
(3)
   
Notice of Adjustment
. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice. The certificate shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
(4)
   
Voluntary Increase
. The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 2.07, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is so increased, the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of such increase. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such notice except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof. The Company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the increased Conversion Rate takes affect. The notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period it shall be in effect.
(5)   
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
. In case:
(a)
   
the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 2.07;
 
 
 
 
(b)
   
the Company shall authorize the granting to all or substantially all the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants;
(c)
   
of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(d)
   
of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company,
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Note register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, or rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
(6)
   
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger, Binding Share Exchange or Sale
. If any of the following events occur, namely (a) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination); (b) any consolidation, merger, combination or binding share exchange of the Company with another corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; or (c) any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture, providing that each Note shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance. Such supplemental indenture shall
 
 
 
 
provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 2.08(6).
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Note register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, binding share exchanges, sales and conveyances.
If this Section 2.08(6) applies to any event or occurrence, Section 2.07 shall not apply.
(7)
   
Responsibility of Trustee
. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to either calculate the Conversion Rate or determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same and shall be protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate with respect to the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Article 6 of the Base Indenture, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 2.08(6) relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 2.08(6) or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Article 6 of the Base Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
(8)
   
Simultaneous Adjustments
. In the event that Section 2.07 requires adjustments to the Conversion Rate under more than one of Sections 2.07(l), (2) or (3), and the Record Dates for the distributions giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of Section 2.07(3), second, the provisions of Section 2.07(l), and third, the provisions of Section 2.07(2).
 
 
 
 
(9)
   
Successive Adjustments
. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 2.07, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under Section 2.07 shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
(10)
  
General Considerations
. Whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to Sections 2.07 or 2.08, such adjustments shall be made to the Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of Section 2.07 and 2.08 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
(11)
        
Restriction on Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion
. (a)  Shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes prior to the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement shall be physically delivered in certificated form to the Holders converting such Notes and the certificate representing such shares of Common Stock shall bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend unless removed in accordance with Section 2.08(11)(c).
(b)
   
If (i) shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes prior to the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement are to be registered in a name other than that of the Holder of such Notes or (ii) shares of Common Stock represented by a certificate bearing the Restricted Common Stock Legend are transferred subsequently by such Holder, then, unless the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective and such shares are being transferred pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holder must deliver to the transfer agent for the Common Stock and to the Company a certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit C as to compliance with the restrictions on transfer applicable to such shares of Common Stock and neither the transfer agent nor the registrar for the Common Stock shall be required to register any transfer of such Common Stock not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate.
(c)
   
Except in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement, if certificates representing shares of Common Stock are issued upon the registration of transfer, exchange or replacement of any other certificate representing shares of Common Stock bearing the Restricted Common Stock Legend, or if a request is made to remove such Restricted Common Stock Legend from certificates representing shares of Common Stock, the certificates so issued shall bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend, or the Restricted Common Stock Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Company such reasonably satisfactory evidence, which, in the case of a transfer made pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, may include an opinion of counsel pursuant to the laws in the State of New York, as may be reasonably required by the Company, that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144A, Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 and that such shares of Common Stock are securities that are not "restricted" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Upon provision to the Company of such reasonably satisfactory evidence, the Company shall cause the transfer agent for the Common Stock to countersign and deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock that do not bear the legend.
(12)
  
Adjustment for Conversion Upon a Cash Take-Over Transaction
. If a Holder elects to convert Notes, pursuant to the satisfaction of the conditions described in clause (e) of paragraph 9 in the Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change referred to in clause (b) of
 
 
 
 
the definition of Fundamental Change contained in Section 1.01 (or a transaction that would have been a Fundamental Change under clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change but for the operation of the Trading Price Exception) pursuant to which 10% or more of the consideration for the Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal rights) in the transaction or transactions otherwise constituting the Fundamental Change does not consist of Publicly Traded Securities (a "
Cash Take-Over Transaction
"), the Company will increase the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "
Additional Common Stock
") as set forth below. The number of shares of Additional Common Stock shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Cash Take-Over Transaction becomes effective (the "
Effective Date
") and the price (the "
Stock Price
") paid per share for the Common Stock in the Cash Take-Over Transaction. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Cash Take-Over Transaction, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to but not including the Effective Date.
The Stock Prices set forth in the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. On such date, the Stock Prices shall be adjusted by multiplying:
 
 
The following table sets forth the hypothetical Stock Price and number of shares of Additional Common Stock issuable per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes:
 
 
 
 
If the Stock Price or Effective Date is not set forth in the table above and the Stock Price is:
 
SECTION 2.09.      
Interest
The Notes shall bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year on the Principal Amount hereof, from November 20, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which payment has been made or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2008 (each an "
Interest Payment Date
") to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on March 1 and September 1 (each a "
Regular Record Date
") (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Interest on Notes converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, but prior to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date, will be paid to the Holder of such Notes on the Regular Record Date but, upon conversion, the Holder must pay the Company the interest which has accrued and will be paid to the Holder on such Interest Payment
 
 
 
 
Date. No such payment by the Holder need be made with respect to Notes in respect of which a Redemption Date has been declared that falls within this period or on such Interest Payment Date.
SECTION 2.10.     
 Reserved
SECTION 2.11.      
Payment of Principal or Interest
(1)
   
Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust
. Prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on any applicable payment date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto) a sum sufficient to pay principal, if applicable, or interest, if any, when due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal or interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
(2)
   
Holder Lists
. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Security Registrar, the Company shall furnish, or cause the Security Registrar to furnish, to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.
(3)
   
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
. (a) Semiannual interest on any Notes that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Each installment of semiannual interest on any Notes shall be paid in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States. In the case of a Global Security, semiannual interest payable on any applicable payment date will be paid to the Depositary, with respect to that portion of such Global Security held for its account by Cede & Co., for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
(b)
   
Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Notes, any semiannual interest on any Notes that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, within 30 days following any applicable payment date (herein called "
Defaulted Interest
", which term shall include any accrued and unpaid interest that has accrued on such defaulted amount in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Notes), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder
 
 
 
 
thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11 and Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture, Notes delivered under this Supplemental Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Notes shall carry the rights to semiannual interest accrued and unpaid to, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Notes.

THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.
 
4.75% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023
               
This Note shall bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year on the Principal hereof, from November 20, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which payment has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2008 (each an "
Interest Payment Date
") to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on March 1 and September 1 (each a "
Regular Record Date
") (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Interest on Notes converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, but prior to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date, will be paid to the Holder on the Regular Record Date but, upon conversion, the Holder must pay the Company the interest which has accrued and will be paid to the Holder on such Interest Payment Date. No such payment need be made with respect to Notes in respect of which a Redemption Date has been declared that falls within such period or on such Interest Payment Date.
If the Principal hereof or any portion of such Principal is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to paragraph 5 hereof, upon the date set for payment of a Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof or upon the Final Maturity of this Note) or if interest due hereon or any portion of such interest is not paid when due in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 10 hereof, then in each such case the overdue amount shall bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per annum, compounded semiannually (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable on demand.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall make payments in respect of the Notes to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Redemption Date or Final Maturity, as the case may be, or at the close of business on a Purchase Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be. Holders must surrender Notes to the Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Notes. The Company shall pay, at the office of the Paying Agent, cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money mailed to the Holder's registered address or, with respect to Global Securities, by wire transfer.
 
 
 
 
Initially, The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation (the "
Trustee
"), shall act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Security Registrar.

The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar.

the Notes are not redeemable prior to March 15, 2013.
Notice of redemption at the option of the Company shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, on and after the Redemption Date interest, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Notes or portions thereof.

(c) Holders have the right to withdraw any Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivery to the Paying Agent of a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
(d) If cash (and/or Common Stock if permitted under the Indenture) sufficient to pay a Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be, of all Notes or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Purchase Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Business Day following the Purchase Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, interest, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Notes (or portions thereof) on and after such Purchase Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be, upon surrender of such Note).
The Notes shall be direct senior obligations of the Company and shall rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and

(c) the Notes no longer are assigned credit ratings by at least two of Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings;
(d) the Notes have been called for redemption by the Company, in which case a Holder may convert Notes into Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date;
(e) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities), in which case a Holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date for the transaction until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction; or
(f) the Company elects to (i) distribute to all holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Company's Board of Directors exceeding 15% of the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution or (ii) distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of such distribution, Common Stock at less than the Sale Price at the time of such distribution. In the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Company must notify the Holders at least 20 Business Days prior to the ex-dividend date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the ex-dividend date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place. The ex-dividend date is the first date upon which a sale of the Common Stock does not automatically transfer the right to receive the relevant dividend from the seller of the Common Stock to its buyer.
(g) at any time after February 15, 2023 and prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity.
Notes in respect of which a Holder has delivered a notice of exercise of the option to require the Company to purchase such Notes pursuant to Sections 2.03 or 2.04 may be converted only if the notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
 
 
 
 
The initial Conversion Rate is 80.5153 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Company shall deliver cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock.
Holders of Notes at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Notes at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date (except for Notes in respect of which a Redemption Date has been declared that falls within this period or on such Interest Payment Date) must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest that the Holder is to receive on the Notes. Except where Notes surrendered for conversion must be accompanied by payment as described above, no interest on converted Notes will be payable by the Company on any Interest Payment Date subsequent to the date of conversion.
To convert the Notes a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the Notes (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent at the office maintained by the Conversion Agent for such purpose, (2) surrender the Notes to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
A Holder may convert a portion of the Notes only if the Principal Amount of such portion is $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of the Notes, that portion of accrued and unpaid interest attributable to the period from the Issue Date to the Conversion Date with respect to the converted portion of the Notes shall not be canceled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through the delivery of the Common Stock (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the portion of the Notes being converted pursuant to the terms hereof; and the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for interest accrued and unpaid through the Conversion Date, and the balance, if any, of such Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for the Principal Amount of the Notes being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Notes, any Defaulted Interest on any Note shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date or accrual date, as the case may be, by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company as provided for in Section 2.11(3)(b) of the Supplemental Indenture.
 
 
 
 
   
The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 Principal Amount and multiplies of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or convert Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) or any Notes in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Note to be purchased in part, the portion of the Note not to be purchased) or any Notes for a period of 15 days before any selection of Notes to be redeemed.
The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of this Note for all purposes.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or property held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Notes that remains unclaimed for two years,
provided, however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such return, shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money or property remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed money or property then remaining shall be returned to the Company. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or property must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults or noncompliance with certain provisions may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture or the Notes may be amended without the consent of any Holders under circumstances set forth in Section 9.01 of the Base Indenture.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, may declare the Principal Amount and any accrued and unpaid interest, of all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which shall
 
 
 
 
result in the Notes being declared due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
Events of Default in respect of the Notes are set forth in Section 4.01 of the Supplemental Indenture and Section 5.01 of the Base Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives satisfactory indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, conditions and exceptions, Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power, including the annulment of a declaration of acceleration. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment on any Notes) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
In the event of a consolidation, merger, or sale of assets to convey, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of Company's property or assets as described in Section 8.01 of the Base Indenture, the successor corporation to the Company shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, and may exercise the Company's rights and powers under this Indenture, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the Company shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the Notes.
The Trustee, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Security Registrar under the Indenture, each in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Security Registrar.
The Company will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Notes. These calculations include, but are not limited to, determination of the market prices for the Common Stock, accrued interest payable on the Notes and Conversion Price of the Notes. The Company will make these calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, these calculations will be final and binding on the Holders. The Company will provide to each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a schedule of its calculations and each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent is entitled to rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without independent verification. The Trustee will forward the Company's calculations to any Holder upon the request of such Holder.
A director, officer or employee, as such, of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any stockholder as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder
 
 
 
 
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
This Note shall not be valid until an authorized officer of the Trustee or Authenticating Agent manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side of this Note.
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TENANT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of law rules of said state.

Registration Expenses
 
 
 
 
(a)The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each such Holder and each Person who controls any such Holder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made), and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to the party claiming indemnification furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.

The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities registered under the Shelf Registration Statement, its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each Person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling Holders provided in this paragraph (a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement.
(b)Each Holder of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Shelf Registration Statement and each Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
   
(c)Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect
   
 
 
 
 
thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

(d)In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending such loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Exempted Exchanges and the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shall any subsequent Holder of any Securities be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the fees
   
Losses
provided

payable to the Dealer Manager applicable to such Security, as set forth in the Exempted Exchange Material, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes exchanged in the Exempted Exchanges (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Exempted Exchange Material and (y) the total amount of Additional Amounts which the Company was not required to pay as a result of registering the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Benefits received by the Dealer Manager shall be deemed to be equal to the aggregate amount of fees paid by the Company in connection with the Exempted Exchanges under the Dealer Manager Agreement, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving the Securities registered under the Securities Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
INTERPUBLIC ANNOUNCES EXCHANGE OF $200 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES
Initial Put Date Extended from 2008 to 2013
 
New York, NY (November 15, 2007)  The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) announced today that it has agreed to exchange $200 million aggregate principal amount of new 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same principal amount of its old 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. These exchanges are being conducted on a private basis in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 with a small number of qualified institutional buyers that currently hold the old notes. The exchanging holders will also receive accrued but unpaid interest on their old notes. The exchanges are expected to close on November 20, 2007.
 
The main differences between the new notes and the old notes are as follows: (a) the interest rate will be 4.75% rather than 4.50%, (b) the first call date will be later (March 15, 2013 rather than September 15, 2009), (c) the first date of repurchase at the option of the holders will be later (March 15, 2013 rather than March 15, 2008) and (d) payment of cash dividends on Interpublic's common stock will trigger an adjustment to the new notes' conversion rate, but will not trigger payment of contingent interest. Like the old notes, the new notes will pay interest semiannually and will mature on March 15, 2023. The conversion provisions of the new notes are substantially similar to those of the old notes. The new notes are subject to restrictions on transfer as a result of the private placement.
 
Based on currently available information, Interpublic expects that the exchanges will be treated as an extinguishment of the old notes and an issuance of new debt for accounting purposes. Assuming that extinguishment accounting applies, the new debt will be reflected on Interpublic's balance sheet at its fair value, or approximately $211.5 million. Interpublic expects to record a non-cash charge to pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2007 for the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying value of the old debt, or approximately $11.5 million. This difference will be amortized through the first put date in 2013, resulting in a reduction of reported interest expense in future periods. The amount of the charge ultimately recorded will be based upon market conditions at the time when the exchanges are settled and may differ from this estimate.

The new notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the new notes have not been and, at the time of the closing of the transaction, will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. They may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
