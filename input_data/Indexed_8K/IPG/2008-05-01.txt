In May 2008, we reached a settlement with the SEC concluding the investigation that began in 2002 into our financial reporting practices. The SEC filed a complaint on May 1, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Interpublic and our subsidiary McCann-Erickson Worldwide Inc., or McCann, with violations of the federal securities laws. The charges under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws relate to intercompany accounting practices at McCann that were addressed in our restatement of 1997 to 2002 results first announced in August 2002 and that were also the subject of a class action under the federal securities laws that we settled in 2004. The charges relating to violations of the disclosure, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws also relate to the restatement we presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the restatement we first announced in August 2002. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Interpublic and McCann agreed to an injunction against violating the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, and McCann agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty and disgorgement of one dollar.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Interpublic Announces Agreement to Settle SEC Claims
 
New York, NY  May 1, 2008  IPG announced today that it has been informed by the SEC that the Commission has concluded its investigation into the company's past financial reporting practices, begun in 2002. Further, IPG and the SEC have agreed on a settlement of all charges brought by the SEC against IPG and its subsidiary, McCann-Erickson. While neither admitting nor denying the allegations brought by the SEC, Interpublic and McCann have agreed to an injunction against violating the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, and McCann has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $12 million and disgorgement of one dollar.
 
"We are very pleased to have settled with the SEC and we believe this matter is now behind us," said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO. "As previously disclosed, IPG and McCann have cooperated with the Commission from the start of its investigation. The events that gave rise to the SEC charges of securities fraud relate to intercompany accounting practices at McCann which were addressed in our restatement of 1997 to 2002 results and which did not involve client funds. The individuals named in the SEC's press release today have not been with the company since 2003. Under current management, we have devoted considerable resources to replacing and expanding staff in the relevant areas and our efforts to remediate material financial control weaknesses and improve financial reporting have been a top corporate priority for all of our agencies. As a result, we achieved compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley standards at the end of 2007. Resolving these final legacy issues will allow us to focus on building the business going forward."
