On Thursday, May 28, 2009, at the annual meeting of shareholders of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. ("Interpublic"), Interpublic's shareholders approved The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. 2009 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan replaces the 2006 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2006 PIP") as Interpublic's incentive compensation plan. Executive officers and other employees of Interpublic and its subsidiaries selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may receive grants of stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, performance share grants, other stock-based grants and awards and/or cash-based grants and awards, under the terms of the Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, (i) stock options and/or SARs, (ii) performance-based restricted stock and/or restricted stock units and (iii) performance shares, performance share units or other stock based awards may be granted to an individual in any Plan Year with respect to a number of shares of common stock of Interpublic that in the aggregate does not exceed 2,000,000 shares, 1,000,000 shares or 2,000,000 shares, respectively. Under the Plan, the Committee may also grant long-term cash-based awards and/or annual incentive cash-based awards to any eligible individual in an amount up to $6,000,000 for each type of award in any Plan Year. The number of shares of common stock reserved for stock option and SAR awards under the Plan is equal to the sum of (i) the number of shares available for the grant of stock options and SARs under the 2006 PIP as of the effective date of the Plan and (ii) any shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise or settlement of outstanding stock options and SARs granted under any prior Interpublic incentive plan that cease to be subject to such awards for any reason other than exercise or settlement of the awards in shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock reserved for Full Value Shares (as defined in the Plan) is equal to the sum of (i) 20,000,000 million shares, (ii) the number of shares available for Full Value Awards (as defined in the Plan) under the 2006 PIP as of the effective date of the Plan and (iii) any shares that are the subject of outstanding Full Value Awards granted under any prior Interpublic incentive plan that are canceled, other than shares that are withheld to satisfy withholding tax obligations, or not issued. A more detailed summary description of the Plan can be found in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2009, under the heading "

, Options that are automatically granted to an optionee when the optionee uses Shares to pay the exercise price, or to satisfy withholding tax obligations associated with the exercise, of previously granted Options) or any Option or SAR that is not structured to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)

Except as required by Section 4(e) hereof, the Committee may not (1) reprice Options or SARs or (2) exchange Options or SARs for cash, stock or other consideration without the approval of the Company's shareholders.
(c)           
Exercise.
Each Option and SAR shall be exercised at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify in the applicable Award Agreement or thereafter; provided that unless the Option or SAR becomes vested earlier pursuant to Section 11 or 12(e) hereof, an Option or SAR may not be exercised in whole or in part during the twelve-month period commencing on the date on which the Option or SAR was granted. The Committee may impose such conditions on the exercise of Options and SARs as it determines to be appropriate, including conditions relating to the application of federal or state securities laws. No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option unless arrangements satisfactory to the Committee have been made to assure full payment of the exercise price therefor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payment of the exercise price of an Option may be made (i) in cash, (ii) if and to the extent permitted by the Committee, by exchanging Shares owned without restriction for a period of at least six months, or the ownership of which is attested to, by the optionee, or (iii) by a combination of the foregoing. The combined value of all cash and the fair market value of any Shares tendered to the Company, valued as of the date of such tender shall be equal to (or greater than) the aggregate exercise price.

Section 11. Termination of Employment.
(a)           
Termination Other than for Cause.
If a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment for any reason other than for Cause, the Participant shall be vested only in the portion of the Award (if any) in which the Participant was vested immediately before the Participant's Termination of Employment, except to the extent (1) expressly set forth in the Plan or applicable Award Agreement or (2) to the extent permitted by the Plan, that the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, and subject to Section 12(e) hereof and the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, the Committee may not determine that an Award shall be vested before the first anniversary of the date on which the Award was granted unless the Participant's Termination of Employment was due to Retirement, death, or Disability.
(b)           
Termination for Cause.
If a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment for Cause, then all outstanding Awards shall immediately be canceled, except as the Committee may otherwise provide in the applicable Award Agreement.
Section 12. General Provisions.
(a)           
Awards.
Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced in writing. The written terms of the Award shall be delivered to the Participant and, except in the case of an EIP Award, shall incorporate the terms of the Plan by reference.
(b)           
Interpretation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, to the extent that any Award is intended to qualify as "other performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, the Committee shall not exercise any discretionary authority otherwise granted under the Plan with respect to such Award that would cause such Award to fail to qualify as "other performance-based compensation." For example, with respect to any Award that is intended to qualify as "other performance-based compensation," the Committee shall not exercise discretion to increase the value of the Award and, except in the case of death, Disability, or a Change of Control, the Committee shall not allow payment of any Award before it has certified in writing that the applicable Performance Objectives have been achieved.
(c)           
Withholding.
The Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant in cash any taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under the Plan. In the case of any Award satisfied in Shares, no Shares shall be issued unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the Company shall have been made to satisfy any withholding tax obligations applicable with respect to such Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to such terms and conditions as
 
-16-
 
 
 
the Committee may impose, the Company shall have the right to (i) retain Shares or (ii) subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may establish from time to time, permit Participants to elect to tender Shares (including Shares issuable in respect of an Award) to satisfy, in whole or in part, the amount required to be withheld.
(d)           
Nontransferability.
Unless the Committee shall permit (on such terms and conditions as it shall establish) an Award to be transferred to a member of the Participant's immediate family or to a trust, partnership, corporation, or similar vehicle the parties in interest in which are limited to the Participant and members of the Participant's immediate family (collectively, the "Permitted Transferees"), no Award shall be assignable or transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and except to the extent required by law, no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the Participant. All rights with respect to Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by such Participant or, if applicable, the Permitted Transferees.
(e)           
Change of Control.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, all Awards then outstanding shall immediately become fully vested and any performance-based awards and EIP Awards granted under Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof shall pay at the target level set forth in the applicable Award Agreement; provided, that the Board shall have discretion to prevent accelerated vesting of any Award, if the Board's exercise of discretion does not change the time or form of payment of any Award in a way that would violate the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(f)            
No Right to Employment.
Neither the right to participate in the Plan nor the grant of any Award shall be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate. The Company and each Subsidiary and Affiliate expressly reserve the right at any time to dismiss a Participant free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, except as expressly provided in the Plan or in any applicable Award Agreement.
(g)           
No Rights to Awards; No Shareholder Rights.
No Participant or Eligible Employee shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Participants and Eligible Employees. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award, no person shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares to be issued under the Plan prior to the issuance thereof.
(h)           
Foreign Benefits.
The Committee may grant Awards to Eligible Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who reside in jurisdictions outside the United States. The Committee may adopt such supplements to the Plan as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws of such jurisdictions and to afford participants favorable treatment under such laws; provided that no Award shall be granted under any such supplement on the basis of terms or conditions that are inconsistent with provisions of the Plan.
(i)            
Amendment of Plan.
The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided that no amendment shall be made without shareholder approval if (1) shareholder approval is required by law, regulation, a securities exchange listing requirement, or a provision of the Plan, or (2) if the amendment would increase the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan, except as required by Section 4(e) hereof. Without the written consent of an affected Participant, no termination, suspension, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect any right of such Participant under the terms of an Award granted before the date of such termination, suspension, or modification.
(j)            
Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Shares under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.
(k)           
Compliance with Legal and Exchange Requirements.
The Plan, the grant and exercise of Awards thereunder, and the other obligations of the Company under the Plan, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or
 
-17-
 
governmental agency as may be required. The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the grant and exercise of Awards, the issuance or delivery of Shares under any Award or any other action permitted under the Plan to permit the Company, with reasonable diligence, to complete such stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of Shares or other required action under any federal or state law, rule, or regulation and may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Company shall not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to recognize the exercise of any Award or otherwise to sell or issue Shares in violation of any such laws, rules, or regulations; and any postponement of the exercise or settlement of any Award under this provision shall not extend the term of such Awards, and neither the Company nor its directors or officers shall have any obligation or liability to the Participant with respect to any Award (or stock issuable thereunder) that shall lapse because of such postponement.
(l)            
Deferrals.
Subject to the Committee's reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may:
(n)           
Severability of Provisions.
If any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.

(o)           
Incapacity.
Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person, or other person incapable of receipting therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person's guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment shall fully discharge any liability or obligation of the Committee, the Board, the Company, and all other parties with respect thereto.
(p)           
Rules
 
of Construction.
Whenever used in the Plan, words in the masculine gender shall be deemed to refer to females as well as to males; words in the singular shall be deemed to refer also to the plural; the word "include" shall mean "including but not limited to" and references to a statute or statutory provision shall be construed as if they referred also to that provision (or to a successor provision of similar import) as currently in effect, as amended, or as reenacted.
(q)           
Headings and Captions.
The headings and captions in this Plan document are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan.
(r)            
Applicable Law.
The validity, construction, interpretation, administration, and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
(s)           
Effective Date.
The Plan shall become effective on the date the Plan is approved by the Company's shareholders. No Awards may be granted under the Plan after the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders in 2019; provided that any Awards granted before such annual meeting shall continue in effect thereafter in accordance with the terms of the Awards and the Plan. Upon shareholder approval of the Plan, no awards may be made under The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. 2006 Performance Incentive Plan.
