Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On June 1, 2009, General Motors Corporation ("GM") and certain U.S. affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. GM and its worldwide subsidiaries taken together are among the largest clients of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries. Based on the information the Company has reviewed concerning the reorganization proceedings, the Company believes that its maximum potential exposure for accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients as a result of the current proceedings is $50 million. GM's subsidiaries outside the United States have not commenced bankruptcy or similar proceedings, and if they did so the Company's potential exposure could increase.
The statements above are forward-looking statements and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, particularly concerning the conduct and outcome of the GM proceedings. The Company's evaluation of its potential exposure could change as the proceedings unfold and as it has more information, and it does not assume any duty to update these disclosures.
