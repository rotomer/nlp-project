(the "Company") and SunTrust Bank (to the interests of which as indenture trustee U.S. Bank National Association has succeeded) (the "Trustee"), and the 5.40% Notes due 2009 (the "Notes"), that the Company will redeem all of the outstanding Notes on September 14, 2009 (the "Redemption Date") at a price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes), plus twenty-five basis points, as calculated by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined in the Notes) plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
