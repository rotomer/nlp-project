On March 8, 2010, The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (Interpublic) entered into an Agreement Regarding Retirement, effective April 1, 2010, with John J.

The summary of the terms of the Agreement set forth below is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
Under the Agreement, Mr. Dooner will continue to be employed until March 31, 2011 at his current salary.  Effective as of March 31, 2010, he will cease to be Chief Executive Officer of McCann.  From April 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010, Mr. Dooner will serve as Executive Chairman of McCann.  He will relinquish that position, effective December 31, 2010; however, through March 31, 2011, he will continue to assist Interpublic and McCann in the transition of leadership responsibilities to McCanns new leadership team.  The Agreement provides that, in recognition of the contributions made by Mr. Dooner over his long career with McCann and Interpublic and his commitment to assist in the leadership transition at McCann, as long as Mr. Dooner remains employed by McCann or Interpublic through March 2011, he will receive the following compensation and benefits:  (i) an award pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan for calendar year 2010, granted under the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Interpublics Current Report on Form 8-K on June 2, 2009); (ii) effective March 31, 2011, full vesting of all of his then outstanding Interpublic stock options, with each option exercisable until the earlier of March 31, 2014 or the tenth anniversary of the grant date, the release of all restrictions on his then-outstanding  shares of Interpublic restricted stock and vesting of his 2009 Performance Cash Award granted under Interpublics 2006 Performance Incentive Plan (the PIP) (filed on April 27, 2006 as Appendix A to Interpublics Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A); (iii) subject to achievement of applicable performance criteria, shares of Interpublic common stock or cash in settlement of his 2008 Performance Share Award, granted under the PIP; and (iv) participation in Interpublics Executive Medical Plus Plan, if he elects to extend his coverage for the period of time allowed by COBRA, and thereafter, participation in Interpublics Retiree Medical Plan, provided in each instance that he makes all premium payments.  In accordance with one of the conditions of the Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Interpublic has approved this retirement package.
The Agreement states that Mr. Dooners employment agreement with Interpublic made as of January 1, 1994, (filed as Exhibit 10(r) to Interpublics Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995), as amended, will remain in full force and effect, except to the extend such provisions are expressly modified by the arrangements described above.    Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Dooner will be subject to a non-solicit of employees and clients for twenty-four months following the termination of his employment.
The Agreement also provides that Mr. Dooner will receive additional payments under retirement agreements, previously entered into with Interpublic, and under the Interpublic Retirement Account Plan and the Interpublic Savings Plan, in each instance in accordance with the terms and provisions of those arrangements.

The parties anticipate that during this period, Executive will not be working for Interpublic or McCann on a full-time basis, but that the level of services that he performs will be more than 20 percent of the average level of services that he performed over the immediately preceding 36 months.
 
 
 
 
If Executive is requested to provide any services to McCann or Interpublic after March 31, 2011, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to establish mutually acceptable terms of engagement.
 
3.           .  In consideration of the contributions that he has made over a long career with McCann and Interpublic, and Executives commitment to ensure that the transition to new leadership at McCann is successful, Executive shall be eligible to receive the following compensation and benefits, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of Interpublics Board of Directors, and provided that he remains employed by McCann or Interpublic, and performs the duties required hereunder, through the earlier of (i) March 31, 2011, or (ii) the scheduled payment date:

The amount payable under such 2009 Performance Cash Award shall be determined based on 2009 and 2010 performance, with a performance rating for 2011 of 0%.  By way of example, if Executives performance ratings for 2009 and 2010 are at target, the amount payable under the 2009 Performance Cash Award would be equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the target amount.

g.           Because Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(i)), payments under the Executive Special Benefit Agreements () between Executive and Interpublic shall begin in the seventh month that starts after Executives separation from service, in accordance with the terms of the ESBAs.

h.           Executive shall be entitled to benefits under the Interpublic Retirement Account Plan, the Interpublic Savings Plan, and the special deferred compensation arrangement described in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Arrangements section of Interpublics definitive proxy statement filed on April 30, 2009.  Such benefits shall be calculated and paid in accordance with the applicable plan documents.  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to enhance or diminish Executives rights under the plans referenced in this Paragraph 3.h.
 
i.           After March 31, 2011, Interpublic shall have no further obligation to make premium payments towards Executives individual term life insurance policy.

5.           .  This Agreement shall be construed, administered, and interpreted in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.  If Interpublic or Executive determines that any provision of this Agreement is or might be inconsistent with the requirements of Section 409A, the parties shall attempt in good faith to agree on such amendments as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid causing Executive to incur adverse tax consequences under Section 409A.  No provision of the Agreement, as amended hereby, shall be interpreted or construed to transfer any liability for failure to comply with Section 409A from Executive or any other individual to Interpublic or any of its affiliates.
