Summary
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased with the second quarter's strong performance in terms of both growth and profitability.  Contributions to our organic revenue growth came from existing and new clients across a range of industry sectors, from the U.S. and emerging international markets and from a broad cross-section of the agencies in our portfolio, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO.  We are proving that we have the talent and the tools to benefit from a macro recovery and the ability to convert revenue growth into bottom line results.  Of course, there remain areas of uncertainty in the global economy, so we will continue to manage the business conservatively.  With revenue stability and growth back in the picture, we feel we are very much on track to deliver on our oper ating margin objective of better than eight percent for 2010.  Combined with our commitment to put the cash on our balance sheet to work on behalf of shareholders, we believe our financial performance positions us well to enhance shareholder value going forward.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
 
Good morning and welcome to The Interpublic Groups second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. . . .  I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
 
Good morning.  Thank you for joining us.  We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, Interpublic.com, and well refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We will plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.
 
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us as we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2010.
 
Ill begin by covering the headlines of our performance.  Frank will then take us through the financial results.  After his remarks, Ill return with specific observations relating to the agencies and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.
 
Overall, its fair to say that were quite pleased with second quarter performance that was strong on both the top and bottom line.
 
 
 
 
As reported, revenue increased 9.7% in the quarter, and revenue was up 8.5% organically.  The improvement relative to last year is significant, as is the sequential change from the first quarter.
 
As was the case in the first quarter, we saw results strengthen month-to-month during Q2.  We also saw contributions pretty much across the board in terms of geography, client sectors and across our portfolio of agencies.  Of course, it should be noted that the severity of the downturn last year means we had the benefit of favorable comps this quarter.
 
Nonetheless, organic revenue increase of 13.6% in the U.S. clearly shows that the signs of an economic recovery are giving clients greater opportunities to engage in marketing spend.  Activity in developing regions is continuing to pick up, and we experienced double-digit organic growth in Brazil, China and India during the second quarter.
 
While Europe showed sequential improvement, we remain cautious about the situation in that region, and a European recovery is not factored into our budgets or operating plans for 2010.
 
In terms of client sectors, growth in the quarter and year-to-date has been very strong in the auto, retail and financial services sectors.  With the major challenges that we all faced in 2009 seemingly behind us, companies in every industry are increasingly looking forward.  They are asking our agencies for innovative new programs and integrated multi-agency solutions that can help them win market share by fully engaging consumers in todays complex media landscape.
 
In fact, all of the major client sectors we track are up for both the quarter and the first half, except for the tech and telecom sector, in which, as we previously mentioned, lost assignments with some large clients in 2009 will weigh on our results for the balance of the year by approximately 1%.
 
Our pipeline is solid at the regional and local level and at all our major agencies.  On a trailing-12-month basis, we remain net-new-business positive through the end of the second quarter.
 
All told, our top line performance is ahead of where we had [expected] it to be at this point in time.  Thats a reflection of the strength of our offerings and people, as well as the broader economic stabilization and recovery in a number of major world markets.

In speaking to clients and our operating unit leadership, we are consistently hearing that the tone of the business is improving.  But there is still a high degree of macro uncertainty, as well as concerns domestically, about jobs and consumer confidence, so we remain very conservative in how we manage the business and highly focused on our cost discipline.
 
The work weve already done in that regard was evident in the second quarters very strong profitability.  Our operating income of $177 million was significantly improved from $97 million a year ago.  Q2 operating margin of 11% was well above last years 6.6% in the comparable period.  Earnings per share were $0.15, compared to $0.04 in the second quarter of 2009.
 
From 2006 to 2008, weve put Interpublic on a path of dramatically improved margin performance.  During the first half of this year, as we emerge from the recession and return to a more normal business environment, we are demonstrating the capacity to get back on that positive margin trajectory.
 
Another area in which our focus and hard work is bearing fruit is our longstanding commitment to conservative balance sheet management.  Financial strength and flexibility have been key to our success, initially as we retooled our company, and more recently as we moved through last years severe economic problems.
 
This approach has once again been validated, as weve seen upgrades from major credit rating agencies during the past few months.  We also successfully negotiated an amended revolving credit facility that provides greater latitude for us to put cash on the balance sheet to work directly in the service of our shareholders.
 
We recently completed the buyback of the majority of our convertible preferreds.  As we continue to see improvements in the broader economy and in our operating performance, we will remain focused on opportunities that allow us to use the strength of our balance sheet to enhance shareholder value.
 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our first-half performance.

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website.
 
On Slide 2, you will see an overview of the quarter.  Results exceeded our expectations from both revenue and operating profit.  We maintained effective discipline over expenses and attained significant year-over-year leverage on base pay roll and occupancy expense.  We also experienced significantly lower severance.
 
Michael mentioned the significant improvement in our operating margin compared to last years second quarter.  Looking back a bit further, our 11% margin this quarter is comparable to Q2 of 2008, even though revenue was $200 million lower this year due to the intervening recession.  Its also worth noting that we concluded the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and completed the successful buyback of the convertible preferred shares in May.
 
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in more detail in the slides that follow.  Its worth noting that our diluted EPS of $0.15 cents treats the benefit of $26 million related to our convertible shares transaction as dilutive to earnings, which is to say the calculation of diluted earnings per share backs out that benefit.  Buying back the preferreds eliminates $16 million of annual dividends, or approximately $0.03 per share, and reduces dilution overhang by 22 million common share equivalents.
 
Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue:

On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments.
 
 
 
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region.
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
 
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-12-month basis.  While still negative, the most recent data points show a dramatic move in the right direction in light of Q2 performance and the roll-off of a very challenging Q2 09.
 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing-12-month basis.  This tracks our progress between 06 and 08, the recession in 2009, and now our upward trend in the first half of this year.  As we have said previously, our objective this year is better than 8%, with organic top line growth, which will put us back on the track of aggressive margin expansion towards our ultimate goal of fully competitive profitability.
 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturity schedules as of June 30th.
 
 
 
 
7
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10: we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, compared with $1.8 billion a year ago.  Including the activity in Q2 that I just reviewed, over the past 12 months we have used a total of approximately $370 million to repurchase debt and convertible preferred stock.
 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter.
 
 
 
 
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance year-to-date.  In terms of organic growth, Q2 was our strongest quarter in many years, though admittedly against a forgiving comp.
 
The growth we have begun to see has enabled us to leverage structural efficiencies that weve put in place over the past few years.  Of course, as economic conditions improve, there will be a higher level of investment to support growth.  As a result, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, with a focus on delivering our services efficiently.  This will allow us to continue delivering on the margin expansion and increased profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
 
Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Michael.

Mr. Roth
 
Thank you, Frank.

On our last call, we said that we were feeling increasingly confident about the revenue prospects for the business.  As you can see, the second quarter provided additional indications that we have come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis.  We now expect to see positive organic growth for the year in 2010.
 
Of course, there are always macro factors that are beyond anyones ability to control, and this remains very much the case at this time in the world economy.  However, we believe that were well-positioned to achieve our objectives going forward.
 
We continue to demonstrate that we have a firm hand on the business.  This was evident in 2009 when we consolidated much of the margin progress made in recent years despite significant challenges created by the recession.  And we have demonstrated it thus far this year, as we begin to once again build momentum behind increased margins and profitability.
 
We are also encouraged because the state of our professional offerings is on the whole very strong.  Across our agencies, we continue to invest in capabilities that help us meet the evolving needs of clients in an increasingly fragmented and technology-driven marketing world.  Talent remains a strategic priority and an area in which we are seeing success in terms of both our recruitment efforts and our development programs.  Our performance when it comes to the majority  major industry honors and agency of the year awards that were announced earlier this year was terrific, with exceptional showings from our media and digital agencies, our PR firms, as well as Draftfcb.
 
Once again, Mediabrands and Draftfcb were the leading drivers of our success during the quarter.  Were seeing Mediabrands roll out leading edge, specialty and digital capabilities around the world, notably in growth markets such as Brazil and India.  Initiative is strengthening its international operations and its management bench.  The string of wins at UM continues, with LOreal and Burberry during the quarter, followed by Wells Fargo in July.
 
Draftfcbs integrated, channel-neutral model is now fully operational in the key world markets.  The State Farm win in April was significant for them, as are new international assignments from Yum! Brands and the recent arrival of a new leader for its China operations.  The agencys global management is fully aligned and focused on a strategic plan that will take the merger to a new phase of global growth.  The performance of Draftfcb Healthcare also continues to be a standout.

At McCann Worldgroup, new leadership is in place, and were working to harness the power of the industrys premier global network and its full range of allied marketing services agencies.  There have already been some changes and additions in the senior ranks, and the management team is focused on continuing to evolve their offering to create leading edge marketing solutions for their clients.  Wins such as IHOP, Haier for the Shanghai Expo, as well as continued expansion of the General Motors relationship at MRM, were also positive signs during the quarter.
 
Lowes turnaround keeps showing real progress.  The agencys relationships with major, multinational clients is strong, and profitability continues to improve.  The merger with Deutsch in North America will create a strong hub from which to pitch global opportunities as the recovery takes hold.  Equally important, the acquisition of DLKW will provide Lowe with a top-five U.K. presence, a strong client list and a seasoned and cohesive management team that is eager to participate in international opportunities.
 
At CMG, we are fortunate to have exceptional agencies, such as Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris in the PR space, that consistently deliver great thinking and programs to our clients.  Our results demonstrate that were winning share in the space.  We are seeing a great deal of digital activity in PR and all of the marketing services agencies within CMG, such as Jack Morton and Octagon, and are building best-in-class social media and word-of-mouth practices.
 
Our digital agencies, from specialists like MRM, R/GA and HUGE, to capabilities within our media agencies and fully integrated agencies and specialty agencies such as our healthcare [agencies], continue to perform very strongly.  Within our group of leading integrated U.S. independents, The Martin Agency and Hill Holliday continue to win and deliver great results.  We have also seen a great number of good wins at Mullen and Gotham, including JetBlue and some work for Chrysler.  This combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will always be the key to our long-term success.
 
With revenue stability and growth solidly back in the picture, we feel we are very well-positioned to deliver on our operating margin objective of better than 8% for the full year.  We have the talent and the tools to benefit from a broader recovery, and were proving that we have the ability to convert revenue growth into bottom line results.
 
 
10
 
But we have always been clear that its not advisable to extrapolate the future from a single quarter or performance.  In recent weeks, we have seen key economic indicators in flux, and there is still uncertainty due to the situation in Europe, to consumer sentiment and job outlook and to continued volatility in the financial markets.  That is why we believe its responsible to continue to be conservative in how we manage expenses and in our outlook for the business for the remainder of 2010.
 
In sum, we are very encouraged by our companys strong performance for the quarter and for the half year, and we are pleased by the improvement in the tone of the business.  This will be a year in which we return to growth and to a trajectory of strong margin expansion.  Well continue to look for ways to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value.  And as the recovery fully takes root and becomes more widespread, we will ideally be positioned to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in 2011 and beyond.
 
And with that, I thank you all for being with us and open the floor for questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
:
Operator
 
. . . .   And our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan Chase.
 
, :
Alexia Quadrani
J.P. Morgan Securities
 
Thank you.  Just a couple of questions.  First, did the month-to-month improvement that you cited continue so far in July?  And then a second question is, just drilling down on the auto category or your new business: am I fair to assume that the piece of the Chevy business that was announced has not moved yet so its still in the numbers this quarter, but the Chrysler business  media business that you did win  thats also in the numbers?  Is that a fair assumption?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Alexia. First of all, our business is very seasonal, and obviously July is not as strong a month historically as June.  We had a very strong June.  So although we dont have final results from July, I would suspect its not going to be as strong as June.  But thats not a surprise for us, and its not inconsistent with our history in terms of our business.
 
As far as the auto sector, weve had strength  I mean, the strength in our auto sector for the year and for the quarter reflects our wins at VW, as well as increased spend at Hyundai, and General Motors in general, including MRM.  As I indicated in the first quarter, the significance of it is not just Campbell-Ewald and Chevy.  And as we indicated, the loss of that business is not a significant number to us.  But we havent seen any significant reductions in Campbell-Ewald to date.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
 
And then just a follow-up on the event business.  You mentioned a rebound in the U.S.  Im assuming from your comments on the U.K. that youre not quite seeing a rebound in the event business yet in Europe.  I guess, is that correct?  And when do the comps get a bit easier in the event business in the U.K.?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Well, as Frank indicated, we had a one-time event last year in the quarter in the U.K.  But even with that said, we are still not as strong over there as we are in the United States.  And, obviously, the comps will get a little bit better with respect to events.  In the United States, they had a very good quarter.

Ms. Quadrani
 
Thank you.  Congratulations on a great quarter.

Mr. Roth
 
Thanks, Alexia.

Operator
 
And our next question comes from Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.
 
,:
Matt Chesler
 
Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Good morning.  Two questions.  The first, lets just stick on the topic of revenue.  It was obviously a really strong sequential improvement in revenue from the first quarter to the second quarter: its over 11% improvement.  How sustainable is that?  As I look back historically, thats a bigger sequential move than Ive seen in the past.  Can you give us some examples  real-world examples  that helps to explain how the business can improve of that magnitude from one quarter to the next?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, what we said in the first quarter  the three sectors that are driving this are auto, retail and financial services.  Those are significant improvements; and, frankly, last year they sort of slowed down more than others.  The reasons that you can see this is obviously in those sectors, we are participating in a significant increase in spend.  So thats reflected in the numbers.
 
Sustainability of this kind of growth  obviously, we are cautious in terms of the rest of the year.  We still, nonetheless  if you recall, we had previously said we thought on a flat to slightly positive organic for the year, we can deliver at least 8% margin.  What were saying now is we believe we will certainly be positive for the full year on organic, which means its better than slightly positive, and we say margins should be 8% or better.  We are cautious in the rest of the year and I dont think you should assume that what we achieved in the second quarter is going to continue throughout the full year.  There is cyclicality in our business, and we will experience that.  But, nonetheless, we believe this should be a very good year for us.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
 
Frank, if you did a postmortem of the success that youve had taking out costs from the business during the downturn, could you quantify broadly how much of the expense reduction you think is permanent out of the cost base as opposed to revenue declines such that when revenue comes back we shouldnt see those sort of costs;  we should see a permanent reduction in the cost structure?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Matt, on the O&G, the various components of that, we would like to think that most of that is permanent.  We have become very disciplined across the board in the line items that drive the aggregate O&G, and we have been out there saying that the key metric we look to is O&G as a percentage of revenue.  And it wasnt that long ago it was north of 30%.  Now it is sub 30%.  And were always chipping away at it.  But I think our expectation is that well continue to manage that aggressively.
 
 
14
 
The real key is on the salary line.  We saw great leverage when growth came back into the equation this quarter on our base salaries.  And while youre going to have to invest behind that growth, and you will see the salary line move to track that growth, we do believe a lot of the progress we made in reducing that cost base well see in greater conversion when the revenue comes back on stream.  But for profitability, thats going to be the key area that we need to continue to manage very aggressively.

We will continue to invest in terms of people in the growth markets, which is why weve added  if you look at R/GA, if you look at HUGE, if you look at MRM, you look at the PR businesses, these are  and some parts of Draftfcb domestically  these are growth areas that we will continue to invest behind, and thats going to reflect obviously in the cost structure.  But what we are looking at is making sure that when we do add these people, theyre revenue-facing, and theyre consistent with the margin targets we have set out with respect to our business units.
 
Let me also add that the other part of the encouraging factor, we used to get criticized for being too heavily weighted in packaged goods and health and personal care, and weve seen in the second quarter those two sectors perform nicely as well.  So on your question of sustainability, I think it bodes well for us on the packaged good and health and personal care that were seeing spending in those sectors as well.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
 
I liked the comparison you made from Q2 margins of 11% to Q2 2008, 11%, a couple hundred million dollars less revenue base.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Right.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
 
When you look towards the second half of 2010, how are you comparing that in your minds to how the second half of 2008 shook up?  I mean, would you think that achieving those sort of margins would be something you are striving for, or that you feel that you could do better?
 
 
15
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Well probably get three different ways of asking the same question in terms of what our margin expectations are for the year.  Look, I think if you factor in what Frank was just talking about  if you factor in the cost discipline, if you factor in growth in our various sectors, obviously were going to manage our business to maximize margins for the rest of the year, which is why we say theyre going to be 8% or better.  It would be silly for us to put numbers out there.  But needless to say, were very pleased with the performance for the first half.

Peter Stabler

Thanks very much.  Congratulations.  You mentioned the improvement in June, and it sounds like it was quite remarkable.  And then Im looking at the base, benefits and tax leverage that you mentioned.  Im just wondering whether you really are benefiting here from not having to hire, and that perhaps your June performance was more skewed than perhaps some of your competitors.  Can you give us a sense on whether hiring in July has just accelerated significantly over June, and whether we might see some slippage there?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
I dont agree with the premise that you said.  We added significantly in terms of our headcount in the quarter.  In fact, I think we were up over 500 people.  So its not that we werent spending to recruit in the quarter and that were all of a sudden going to get a huge rash of recruiting in July.  I think what weve said is that our recruiting will follow the revenue, okay?  So  and thats exactly what we have done  so I dont think you are going to see a huge bump in July since we didnt hire them in June, if thats what your question is.
 
:
Mr. Stabler
 
Okay, great, thank you, Michael.  And then another question on McCann.  You mentioned the progress in MRM a couple of different times.  Can you give us a sense of how widely the performance varies within the Worldgroup portfolio?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yes, look, I think the Worldgroup, its a global network, its fully integrated, it has all the disciplines.  There are markets that are obviously  which is consistent with the overall economic environment  for example, Europe.  Thats an area that weve already indicated we have to focus on.  We have made some personnel changes over there.  We added to the talent.  And, frankly, we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.K.  As Frank indicated, absent events, we were positive in the U.K.  So we are looking for improvement, certainly, in the Worldgroup over in Europe, and thats an opportunity for us.  In the United States, it continues to be a very strong force.  And, obviously, if you look at our major clients and spending is up, a significant of those major clients are with the Worldgroup, and thats what the Worldgroup does best, and that is global clients with full integrated offerings.

And our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.
 
,:
David Bank
 
RBC Capital Markets
 
Thanks very much.  Let me be the fourth person to ask a variation of the question.  So all right, I hope this is a fair way to ask it.  I think  what you guys have said before was, in the context of sort of flattish growth, you think you could do the 8%.  What kind of growth would it take to get material expansion on top of that?  I dont think were asking you to give us a target, but I think what we are asking for is, if you could grow, right, mid, low singles  if you could grow mid-singles, what could you do in the context of margin?  Thats question one.
 
And then I think a less difficult question would be, what kind of pricing environment are you seeing, did you see, in the second quarter and the third quarter?  Is it improving?  Are you seeing a little bit more leverage with respect to the client base, or youre still kind of in the same place that you feel like youve been in the last couple of quarters?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Yes, fair question.  And lets look at it this way.  If you recall, before the recession hit, our target was to be competitive from a revenue point of view and achieve double-digit margins, okay?  That was our goal.  We were tracking towards that.  And in that context, we were looking at a 4% to 5%, maybe 6%, organic growth to achieve double-digit margins and competitive margins thereafter.  That is still true for us.  So if we achieve competitive margins in the range of 4% to 5%, our goal is to manage our profitability to achieve competitive margins.  Now your next question was, will be, over what time frame?  And, obviously, that will be subject to the overall macroeconomic environment.  But that has been our goal.  0;It will continue to be our goal, and we are comforted by the results that we are showing, both from a leverage point of view on the cost side as well as the competitiveness of our offerings.
 
As far as pricing goes, we havent seen a huge release in terms of the activity of procurement or clients focusing on getting more for less.  That will continue.  Its continued, and will continue.  But the other side of it is, we have managed to be much more efficient in how we deliver our results.  Clients are demanding the efficiencies, and, frankly, clients are looking for performance, and I think thats part of what you are seeing.  If we can prove performance relating to our offerings, then I think well see, not a total relaxing of pricing, but certainly a value-oriented competitive offering.

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
David, its worth remembering: its not as if we started at 8% and now we have incremental growth and were going to some other number.  We started the year coming off of 5.7% margins.  So weve had significant margin improvement weve committed to, and we are pleased that the revenue is a better story than we anticipated.  Were going to continue to aggressively manage our cost base; but to Michaels point, our goal is not what were going to deliver in 2010.  Our goal is to get to competitive margins.  And its a fair question to say, When are you willing to commit a timeframe?  Were not ready to commit to that timeframe yet.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yes, and the next question that normally follows from that, Are there any structural reasons why you cant achieve that number?  And the answer is no.  Its a journey, and, obviously, we are pleased to be back on that journey.

And our next question comes from James Dix with Wedbush.
 
,:
James Dix
 
Wedbush Securities
 
Good morning, gentlemen.  Just two questions.  First, just on the growth side of things, Im curious as to what your outlook is, really more for the second half of the year as opposed to the first half.  I mean, if you look by halves, your comparison is, if anything, slightly easier in the second half than the first.  So is it  I know you can expect quarterly variability, and Im not expecting you to post another quarter next quarter like the second quarter  but is it reasonable to assume that the second half could be tracking roughly similar to what the first half is?  And if not, why do you think that might be?  And then I have one follow-up after that.
 
 
20
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, our business is a GDP type of business.  So if you could put a number out for GDP, we should fairly track it, slightly behind but well track it.  So if those numbers are 3% to 4%, obviously that would not be a crazy number.  But, again, were not giving out any targets to that.  But certainly at 3.5% for the first six months, you dont need a huge growth in the rest of the year to accomplish that.
 
:
Mr. Dix
 
Okay.  And then I figure my follow-up, I would maybe ask one about margins, since no one had actually asked one yet.  [Laughter.]  I guess one way I was looking at it is, I mean, if you look at where you came in for the quarter versus what the Street was expecting, you beat by around $100 million in revenue and around $50 million in operating profit.  So on that basis, your incremental margin was roughly 50%.  And my understanding is for an agency group or even an agency, 50% incremental margins is very high.  So, is that the right way to look at how you did in the second quarter?  And if so, how sustainable is that level of incremental margin?  And then if its not sustainable, whats a longer term expectation that we should consider reaso nable?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Its an interesting way to ask the same question.
 
:
Mr. Dix
 
Yes, thank you.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
[Laughter.]  Look, I mean, 50% conversion  if we could take 50% conversion, well take it all day long, okay?  So I think thats an attractive number to deliver.  If we deliver conversions of 30% to 40%, I think thats a good number.  So if you want to build in whatever organic growth you have, then we should be trying to deliver those type of conversions.  And I think if you run the math, its consistent with the numbers were saying.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
And James, you saw when revenue was declining at a rapid pace in 2009, it was very difficult to reduce your workforce at that commensurate rate.  And the same thing happens in reverse: when you see the pace of growth we saw in the second quarter, especially with such a strong June, our folks around the world have been working some overtime.  So eventually thats going to have to normalize as we staff up to support that growth.
 
 
21
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yes, and the other  its a mix of business.  Remember, all our businesses arent operating at the same margins.  So part of it will be at what  where is the growth coming from, both regionally as well as by discipline.

Mr. Dix

And the next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
 
, :
Daniel Salmon
BMO Capital Markets
 
Good morning, everyone.  I have two questions, one for Michael, one for Frank.  For Michael, with the platforms in London and New York built out now for Lowe, could you maybe just update us on your thinking for some of the other hubs and whether or not we should expect some moves, either acquisitions or consolidating in maybe some other IPG agencies?  And then for Frank, just maybe give us an update on your thinking on the balance sheet now that youve brought in a slug of the convertible preferred and maybe where you look to do some maneuvers next?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, certainly the key objectives for Lowe were in New York and the U.K., and were very pleased with the solutions that we have already implemented.  Clearly, the growth hubs for Lowe are in China, India and South America.  We have already built up our investments in India, and that will continue.  Obviously, we want to focus on some digital offerings in India and Latin America.  And China is the place, I mean, and thats where we would hope to grow, frankly, all of our offerings, not just Lowe.  So that will be a key focus for us going forward.

Frank Mergenthaler

And Dan, on the balance sheet, we are pleased with where we are at the end of June.  We were pleased at the strong cash position we ended, even taking into account the redemption of the preferreds.  Weve got a maturity coming at us in the third quarter, which well deal with, with cash on hand.  And I think as we demonstrated with our move on the converts, were constantly evaluating ways to use our balance sheet to generate shareholder value, and we weigh that with working with our colleagues at the rating agencies to ensure that investment grade is still an objective of ours and were managing our way towards it.  So a lot of options, and you can expect that well continue to evaluate, and whats the right answer for driving shareholder value.
 
 
22
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
The other part of that answer is, do we see using that to do any large acquisitions, right?  I mean, thats the other part of it.  And as we have said, we dont have any big holes on our offerings, so well be very strategic in both disciplines as well as geographic area.  And I think what you saw in the U.K. is an example of that.  Weve used about $150 million as an objective in terms of acquisitions, and were consistent with that in our overall plan.  So there isnt a need for us to take that cash and go out and buy a huge traditional agency or digital, whatever.  We will use our cash to invest in our businesses, do strategic acquisitions, and, as Frank indicated, focus on our ratings and our balance sheet.

And our next question comes from Matthew Walker from Nomura.
 
, :
Matthew Walker
Nomura International
 
Thank you very much.  Good morning.  Obviously very strong results.  I just have three geographic questions.  The first is on the U.K.  You mentioned it would have been up excluding events.  The first question is, when do events in the U.K. stop being a drag?
 
Second question is on continental Europe.  I think the comparable second half for continental Europe is something like minus 15.  You mentioned that your budget doesnt include a recovery in Europe, but I was hoping you could give some hints on what your budget does include for Europe.
 
 
23
 
And the last question is on the U.S.  Obviously, in common, I guess, with some of the other agencies, the scope of work is increasing quite a lot in the U.S., and there have begun to be some concerns about the U.S. economy.  Has the language of the client  it doesnt sound like it from your comments at all, in fact, quite the opposite  but I was wondering, have some of the U.S. clients begun to sort of moderate their language about increasing scope of work because of the growing uncertainty about the U.S.?
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, the answer to the U.S. is, we havent seen it.  But everyone  every CEO thats looking at this environment is cautious about whether another shoe is going to drop or worried about a double dip.  Frankly, our numbers dont indicate any double dip, and certainly when you look at our clients cash positions overall, they certainly will have the money to spend in marketing dollars.  And this is a great opportunity, even if there is a pullback, to gain market share.  We actually saw even last year some of our clients who had the cash looking at it as an opportunity to gain market share.
 
So, yes, theres caution, and the caution basically turns to us and says, Be more effective and targeted in the offerings that youre giving us.  So theres a lot of dialogue about ROI, theres a lot of dialogue about measurement, targeted spend on the media side.  Do you have the ability to really focus on our marketing dollars in terms of the objectives we are looking at with respect to audiences.  Which is why on the technology side weve made the kind of investments weve made in Mediabrands, Cadreon.  All these new media  ad servers, ad exchanges, if you will  will enable us to target those marketing dollars and give our clients comfort in terms of the ROI with respect to the dollar.  So even if there is a pullbac k in the economic environment, we can show our clients that spending these dollars is going to provide an ROI.  Thats where this business has come to, and thats why we are investing as much as we are in the technology side of our business.  And its not just in Mediabrands, its in all our agencies.
 
On the event side, I think our comps  they dont  they should be relatively straightforward going forward, right?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
They should be, but its worth noting, the events business, its not as if there was a systemic decline in the U.K.  These events  the two of them were actually large  one was government and one was private sector.  We knew they werent going to repeat.  Thats the nature of the events business.  It does create volatility.  Every year an awful lot of their revenue book theyve got to go out and sell again.  So its a volatile business, but for us its very strategic and its profitable, and its one that we are pleased to be in.
 
 
24
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
At the end of 08, the events business, I mean, it just  and the project business  just stopped.  I think the tone of the events business right now is positive, and our second quarter results reflect that.  So thats encouraging; and again, our pipeline is solid.  So I wouldnt suspect that we have a major falloff unless there is a severe cutback in the overall economic situation.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
And on the rest of Europe, youre right; the back half of the year was very challenged, and we have seen sequential improvement in Q1 to Q2.  But I think it would be premature on our part to look to the back half of the year and anticipate anything other than there is still risk in that market.
 
:
Mr. Walker
 
Just a quick follow-up on the U.K.: should we therefore assume  just struggling through when exactly I should put a positive growth number in for the U.K. 
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
You tell us; you should be giving us the answer to that 
 
:
Mr. Walker
 
 well, I was just kind of wondering when these events that didnt recur, when those would cycle out, and therefore them not recurring would not actually be a problem.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
When they cycle back 
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
 yes, I mean, were not going to start disclosing the ins and outs of projected events.  Well call out, as we have, when an event drives a trend line like it did in the U.K. this quarter, we called it out and we disclosed what the normalized revenue line was.  And weve done it when it goes the other way as well.

,

Thanks for squeezing me in, guys.  I appreciate it.
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
We wouldnt leave you out, Ben.
 
Mr. Swinburne
:
 
So I wanted to ask Frank about a couple of the, the two cost buckets that I think have come up a couple of times on the call that really helped the quarter: the base, benefits and tax number and also the occupancy.  So on occupancy, my understanding is youve got a lot of physical costs in there, so were seeing  it makes sense for that to be a lagging sort of cost line as it takes time to renegotiate leases and get out of leases that you dont need  so I guess thats a question: is that the right way to think about it?  And if it is, how many more quarters, or how much longer do you continue to benefit from sort of year-on-year declines there?
 
And then sort of a similar question on base.  I think, Michael, you said you guys were up 500 heads year-on-year.  I just wanted to check that number, because it looks like base salary was basically flat year-on-year.  So Im just trying to understand sort of the driver for the two buckets from a timing perspective.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Ben, on occupancy, weve had an IPG-led real estate team in place for six years, and every real estate transaction around the world goes through that group, and theyre very, very effective in their ability to negotiate and manage both growth and decline.  And I think what we are seeing here is, through the downturn, they were very effective in downsizing our footprint, and as growth comes back in, that you see is on the revenue metric, that there is significant improvement.  So I think we have been very proactive in managing our real estate footprint around the world and will continue to be.  But as you pointed out, its something that is predicated on when leases mature and what market values are in cities; but weve been very effective in taking larger pieces of property, pu tting more agencies in there, leveraging our scale in certain markets, and that work is never done.  So we will continue to press it.
 
 
26
 
Mr. Swinburne
:
 
Any updates on headcount worth mentioning?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
The comment on base is, weve had growth from the beginning of the year to now.  Its difficult to look at Q2 09 to Q2 10.  Probably a more effective look is, is How have you done Q2 2010, to keep that, or in Q1 2010?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Right.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
 and its clear weve been hiring against growth businesses, and weve been doing it throughout the first quarter and into the second quarter, and I think that what were seeing in getting the base leverage is, Michaels point, the hiring were doing is against revenue, and were being very, very efficient in managing our headcount outside of the revenue line.
 
Mr. Swinburne
:
 
And Frank, just a follow-up on the balance sheet.  Is there anything  I know you guys talked about sort of what your potential capital allocation decisions would be  but is there either a leverage target or a gross debt target?  Or maybe anything  all free cash after working cap and any acquisitions would go to share repurchase or return of capital  anything you would add for us to think about?  Because you dont really have any maturities: youve done a great job cleaning the balance sheet up.  So just wondering how youre thinking about those targets.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
We dont have  we are not that precise.  As to Michaels comment earlier, the first allocation of our capital is against high-growth acquisition opportunities, and then well tier back from there depending on what we think will drive the most incremental shareholder value.
 
 
27
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
And let me just add to that.  The rating agencies  the key factor for rating agencies in terms of upticks for us going forward are going to be the sustainability and margin improvement.  I mean, thats  its the same as our shareholders, and that is looking to make sure that theres sustainability and the targets that were setting out are achievable. So as we move towards that, we would expect to see our rating agencies take actions in support of that, and that obviously will flow into what we do with our balance sheet and so on.  So were encouraged by it.
 
Obviously, were all driving to the same thing, and that is, we want to enhance shareholder value, we want to be competitive in the marketplace, and Im  obviously, were very pleased with the results that we have been able to deliver.  And weve ,been having our operating reviews with all of our networks, and Im really encouraged by our talent and our opportunity to recruit and develop our people.  And with our client meetings as well, Im getting positive feedback that weve really stepped up in terms of our offerings and our people, and that makes, obviously, us feel a lot better in terms of our ability to deliver against our objectives.  And so Im really encouraged by it.  This quarter obviously gives us great impetus in moving for ward, and we look forward to talking to you in the third quarter, so thank you all for your support, and well be back at you.  Thank you.
