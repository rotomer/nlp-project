Summary
 
 
 
 
We are pleased to have started the year with another quarter of strong revenue growth and operating margin improvement.  All of our major agencies contributed to this performance, led by our operations in the U.S. and emerging markets, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublics Chairman and CEO.  An increasingly fragmented and complex media landscape creates opportunity for continued growth in our sector.  The strategic decisions and investments weve made in recent years position us well to deliver the highly digital, integrated and accountable marketing solutions our clients need today.  We remain confident that we can deliver on our 2011 targets of 4-5% organic revenue growth and 9.5-10% operating margin, as well as on our long-term commitment to further enhance shareholder value.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Interpublic Group first-quarter 2011 earnings conference call. . . .  I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin..
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning.  Thank you for joining us.
 
We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and will refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We plan to conclude before market open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.
 
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning.  We are pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and operating profit improvement.
 
First-quarter revenue was up 10.3%, driven by an organic increase of 9.3%.  As has been the case in recent quarters, a very broad cross-section of our agencies contributed to this outstanding result.
 
Our organic revenue performance speaks to the competitiveness of our offerings, particularly in the key growth areas that we outlined during our recent Investor Day presentations  that is to say, leading-edge digital capabilities, strong emerging market presence and the capacity to deliver highly integrated and accountable marketing solutions.
 
During the quarter, we saw growth in all regions of the world, led by double-digit gains in AsiaPac and LatAm, and by high-single-digit increases in the U.S. and U.K.  We previously indicated that we had not incorporated expectations of a significant recovery in Continental Europe into our plans for 2011.  However, we did have some growth in that region during Q1.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to client sectors, we also saw consistently positive performance.  Tech and telecom, financial services, health and personal care, auto and transportation and food and beverage all posted double-digit growth in the quarter.  Retail and packaged goods were relatively flat.
 
At the agency level, all of our global networks grew organically, with leadership in the quarter by Draftfcb, Mediabrands and Lowe.  At CMG, our marketing service specialists grew 7.8% organically, led by Weber Shandwick and Golin, FutureBrand and Jack Morton.
 
Our digital offerings were once again outstanding contributors to growth.  We had very strong performance at McCanns MRM unit, R/GA and HUGE, as well as the strong digital capabilities within our media agencies, PR firms and U.S. integrated independent agencies that you all saw on display at Investor Day.  Our agencies continue to make good strides in developing their digital offerings and attracting top digital talent.
 
As we said in our last conference call, our expectations as we entered the year were for some sequential moderation from the very high growth rate in last years fourth quarter.  We were very pleased with Q1 top-line momentum, as well as the tone of our business.
 
Our Q1 seasonal operating loss was $45 million, compared to a loss of $59 million a year ago, a 24% improvement.  Its important to note that this was primarily a result of leverage on base payroll and occupancy expenses.  Frank will have details on that in just a moment.
 
Earnings per share was a seasonal loss of $0.10, compared with a loss of $0.15 a year ago.  As you are aware, the first-quarter is our smallest quarter of the year by revenue, while expenses are more consistent across the year.  So, we typically have a loss in Q1.  While this is expected, it is encouraging to see further improvement in our performance compared to 2010, which was also a year of strong improvement.
 
Before turning it over to Frank, there are a few macro issues that many of you have raised and which I would like to touch on briefly.  First, the situation in Japan.  Above all, our thoughts continue to be with all those affected by the devastating earthquake and tsunami.  Weve been spending a lot of time supporting our colleagues in Japan on both a personal and professional level, and, we will continue to do so.  Thats what matters most.
 
Of course, were now being asked what the impact of this tragedy might be on our business going forward.  To provide some context, Japan represents 1.5% to 2% of our consolidated revenues.  Understandably, we anticipate that we will see revenue decreases in the market for the balance of the year.  As to possible supply and inventory disruptions, for example, in the auto and tech sectors, these will be difficult to forecast, but weve not seen any material budget adjustments to date, and, should they occur, we believe they would be more a matter of timing rather than permanent reductions.
 
Another macro issue that is causing concern has to do with the political and social developments in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa.  Once again, we are in touch regularly with agency leadership, and our focus is on ensuring that our coworkers in that part of the world are safe and that we are doing everything possible to help them.
 
 
2
 
Of course, the situation does raise questions about the impact the upheaval is having a economically and on consumer activity.  To put this into perspective, the region is approximately 3% of our total revenue base; no single country is greater than 1%.  While Q1 revenue growth overall was solid in the region, revenue was negatively [affected] in Egypt, in light of these events.  So while this is not yet a large region for us, conditions are understandably pressuring revenue for some time.
 
Finally, a topic that has also been of significant interest is the potential of commodity price inflation to impact client budgets, particularly in the food and packaged goods sectors.  We have not seen marketing budgets rolled back as a result of input cost inflation.  Cost inflation has always been a part of client conversations throughout the economic recovery and will continue to do so.
 
Those are the areas of concern we are hearing, and we are actively focused on managing through them.
 
As you will see in our results today, the strength of our business and our model, is driving results and creating value.  We have a well diversified revenue base in terms of geographic regions and professional offerings.  Our agencies are performing across the board and we believe there is great opportunity for our industry to benefit from an increasingly fragmented media landscape.  We also continue to demonstrate expense discipline so as to stay on the path we have defined to significantly increase levels of profitability.
 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our financial performance, and I will come back with some closing remarks.
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 
On slide 2, youll see an overview of the quarter which tracks the points that Michael just made.  Q1 revenue growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, and across the entire agency portfolio.
 
Our operating loss in the seasonally small first-quarter improved from a year ago to $45 million from $59 million.  We realized approximately 100 basis points of operating leverage on combined base payroll and temporary labor expense.  We also reduced occupancy expense by 80 basis points of revenue, driving improved leverage on O&G expense.  Going the other way, severance expense was elevated in the quarter compared to a year ago, 160 basis points of revenue this year compared with 80 basis points.  We view this as an investment to continue to drive efficiency as well as identify and act on opportunities to add talent, as well as reduce our expense base.
 
 
3
 
We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position that included $1.85 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet.  This compares with $1.94 billion a year ago.  The comparison includes having used approximately $480 million during the 12 months to pay down both debt and convertible preferred stock, and another $40 million on our new dividend and share repurchase programs.
 
Turning to slide 3, you see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on slides to follow.  Its worth mentioning that Other Income and Expense of negative $6 million reflects mainly a non-cash loss on the disposition of a small agency in the quarter.
 
Turning to operations on slide 4, beginning with revenue:
 
 
 
 
On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments:
 
 
 
Moving on to slide 5, which provides a look at revenue by region:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
 
On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-12-month basis.  The most recent data point at 9.7% now includes Q1-11 and a roll-off of Q1 last year, four quarters of strong organic growth.
 
On slide 7 we took a closer look at operating expenses.  Again, Q1 is historically our smallest revenue quarter.  Our operating loss was $45 million, compared with $59 million a year ago, an improvement of $14 million.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
On slide 8, we show our adjusted operating margin history on a trailing-12-month basis, which was 8.5% as of the end of Q1. As we have said previously, our objective this year is 9.5% to 10%.
 
On slide 9 we turn to cash flow for the quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 10: we ended the quarter with $1.85 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, compared with $1.94 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $90 million.
 
On slide 11 you see our debt maturity schedule as of March 31.  Total debt including our convertible notes is $1.7 billion, a decrease of $200 million from a year ago.
 
The schedule shows $155 million due this year, most of which is short-term debt used locally for working capital purposes that typically remains outstanding.  The smaller piece is our August 2011 maturity, of which only $36 million remains.
 
Looking ahead to 2012 and 13, it is also worth noting that the amounts shown here are the first optional put and call dates of our convertible notes, rather than their maturity dates, which do not occur until 2023.  The parity price for conversion is $12.42 per share.
 
 
6
 
 
In summary, on slide 12, we are pleased with our revenue performance in the quarter.  Our continued progress with costs and profitability means we are managing expenses carefully, even as we invest for growth and efficiency.  This will allow us to continue to deliver on the margin expansion and increased profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
 
Now, Id like to turn the call back over to Michael.
 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Thank you, Frank.
 
Well, as you can see, our performance in Q1 once again demonstrates the strength of our agencies, their people and their professional offerings.  We saw vitality across many client sectors.  We also continued to show that we are able to manage the business effectively and convert revenue gains into improved results.
 
Competitive organic revenue is the best indicator that we are building a terrific talent base and that our strategic decisions are paying off.  Key developments in this area during the quarter include continued progress at McCann. The team there is off to a good start in 2011, particularly with their successful defense of the U.S. Army account.  McCanns strong focus on delivering integrated marketing solutions is getting traction with existing multinational clients, and the agency is active in the new business arena.
 
Draftfcb was also a major contributor to our success in the quarter.  The agency once again grew its revenue and delivered strong profitability.  Their integrated model, which increasingly features digital and shopper marketing capabilities which are key in todays world of real-time marketing.
 
Mediabrands continued to deliver outstanding performance during the first-quarter.  Were very pleased with the leadership of all major units within the group.  While the loss of our Microsoft engagement in North America was disappointing, we subsequently have seen Mediabrands re-sign major clients, such as Sony to a three-year commitment, and win significant new assignments, such as Hasbro.
 
Lowe made solid contributions to Q1 results, and were pleased with Lowes performance and strategic direction.  With their strength in key developing markets, especially Brazil and India, and with the progress they are making in developing a global activation capability, as well as partnering with HUGE in international markets.
 
CMG turned in another strong performance across PR, branding and events.  We continue to see a lot of new client activity across the marketing service portfolio.  There is also a great deal of digital talent being on-boarded at all of our marketing services firms, and we believe this will lead to continued organic growth momentum at Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, Jack Morton, FutureBrand and Octagon.
 
Among the digital specialty agencies, R/GA, HUGE and McCanns MRM posted outstanding results.  Performance at the integrated U.S. independents was also strong, led by terrific brands such as The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday and Mullen.
 
 
7
 
In closing, were pleased with strong Q1 performance, and our long-term view of the opportunity for Interpublic remains unchanged.
 
We continue to operate in a global growth industry.  What is more, in a world driven by digital convergence and accelerating technology, the role of marketing will grow.  As many of you have heard me say, complexity is good for us, because clients need expert guidance and higher value thinking more than ever before.
 
The key drivers of success and value going forward are going to be digital expertise, strength in emerging markets and seamless delivery on the increasingly accountable integrated solutions. The strategic decisions weve taken and the investments weve made in recent years position us well for this new reality.  Weve also consistently shown that we have the ability to effectively manage the business and have put ourselves in the path to competitive operating performance from a margin perspective, while also returning capital to our shareholders.
 
Were aware that we have more difficult comparisons ahead, as we move through the year, which will make it challenging to sustain the very high growth rates weve reported over the last 12 months.  Nonetheless, based on discussions with key clients, its clear that marketers continue to look to us to help them grow.  This gives us a greater confidence that we can deliver on our 2011 targets of 4% to 5% organic revenue growth and 9.5% to 10% operating margin for the full year and continue to deliver on our commitment to increase shareholder value.
 
With that, Id like to open it up to questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
:
Operator
. . . .  our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with J.P. Morgan.
 
, :
Alexia S. Quadrani
J.P. Morgan
Thank you.  Can you give us a little bit of color on how McCann performed in the quarter?  And secondly, you mentioned that you havent really seen any impact from rising commodity prices in terms of your concerns going forward, or at least in the quarter, yet the packaged goods sector didnt see, you know, quite the robust growth that some of your other verticals did.  Maybe you can talk a bit about maybe whats driving the relatively softer performance in the packaged goods category for you guys.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me answer the packaged goods first.  As you know, packaged goods  the comparisons from year-to-year are different because packaged goods, as you know, even during a difficult period, continue to perform reasonably well in terms of growth.  Also, in particular in the packaged goods we had a timing issue in Latin America concerning revenue recognition.  And, that contributed to the, what seems to be a disappointing result.  Its a small amount, Alexia, but it did distort that number a bit and we should see that positive going forward.
 
McCann is really excited and engaged, particularly with respect to the work that theyre doing with their multinational clients.  Their results for the quarter, as we said, were positive.  They are on track in terms of the repositioning of themselves in the marketplace.  Theyve added a lot of new talent, were excited about what theyre doing and the clients reaction to their new talent has been very solid.  So were looking forward to seeing the continued improvement at McCann from a revenue point of view, from an expense point of view and, more importantly, from a new business opportunity.  I think the fact that we retained the Army was a good example of how were positioned and how even on the competitive environment that theyre in that they have the ability to bring in the integrated marketing capabilities with world-class talent.
 
As far as the commodity, I think I answered it on the packaged goods side.  We havent seen it yet.  Obviously the continued focus on our pricing is consistent that weve always seen.  Its difficult, we have to show that the work that were doing provides ROI, which is why weve invested so much in analytics and the capability to show that were moving the needle.  And, were encouraged by what were seeing going forward.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
And then, Michael, on the, on the comments on Continental Europe where you saw some nice growth  and though probably unexpected  can you give us a bit of color on maybe your top markets there?  Germany, France, how they performed?  Sort of, what was working; what wasnt?
 
 
9
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes.  France  U.K., France are performing well.  Germany had a slight reduction, if you will, in the growth, and that had to do with some client reassignments.  But, as we indicated, its performing a little better than we thought they were going to be.  Were not raising any big flags on the overall recovery, but its encouraging to see positive results.  Whats nice in the U.K., is, if you recall, previously we saw some positive results in the U.K., particularly from events.  This time were seeing it across the board in terms of our offerings in the U.K.  So, it wasnt just one specific transaction that gave rise to the improvement.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
And just a last question, maybe for Frank.  Any guidance on how we should think of severance going forward for the rest of year?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Alexia, we usually point out 1% of revenue is a reasonable estimate.  Right now, we ran a little ahead of that in the first quarter, but 1% is probably still a good number.  But, as youve seen the last couple of years with us, its  we will be very aggressive on the severance front, so you think  we think those actions are needed for long-term sustainability of the business.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
Right.  Thank you very much
 
:
Mr. Roth
Thank you, Alexia.

Operator
Your next question comes from John Janedis from UBS.
 
,:
John Janedis
 
UBS Securities
Thank you, good morning, guys.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
 
Mr. Janedis:
Just going back to the retail and packaged goods categories. Were there any account-specific losses in those verticals, and is there any anecdotal evidence that they could maybe be leading indicators of your broader client base in terms of spend?
 
 
10
 
:
Mr. Roth
No, we didnt have any big account losses in either of those verticals.  You all know Walmart is obviously part of our retail sector, and they have been doing some repositioning as you may know in the marketplace.  And that had some effect on that.
 
Mr. Janedis:
Okay.  And then, just back to the U.K.  Michael, theres obviously been a lot of mixed signals on the economy there, and consumer confidence, but clearly it doesnt seem to have had an impact on your business.  But what are you hearing in the market?  And does the outlook you have there change at all post the March quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
No, were still cautious about it.  Obviously we were pleased with the positive results. You know, weve added some new talent, particularly we have new leadership at McCann in the region, we have the Delaney Lund acquisition with Lowe, and Draftfcb has some new talent there as well.  So weve had a lot of new people in talent and were seeing some traction there.  As I said, with that said, were very cautious about it, but it was encouraging to see the positive results in the first-quarter.
 
Mr. Janedis:
Okay maybe just one quick one for Frank.  Frank, is there any kind of target for the buyback at least for the second-quarter?  Should we look at that $11 million or so and triple that to give you like a quarterly number, or no?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
John, no, look, were into the program one month.  The way we work it is, we have daily and weekly targets.  Those targets are tied to our cash flow projections; Q1 is our weakest cash flow quarter.  So, you can expect as cash flow generation increases, well be more aggressive on our buyback.
 
:
Mr. Roth
I think the key to know about the share buyback is that we announced and were authorized to implement a program, were committed to making that program work and return capital to our shareholders, as we said, and well do it in a thoughtful and effective way.  And, thats the way we will move forward.  The fact, as Frank said, were only in it one month, so that should not be an indication of anything other than we started.
 
Mr. Janedis:
Thanks so much.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
Youre welcome.

And next is William Bird with Lazard.
 
, :
William Bird
Lazard Capital Markets
Yes, just two questions.  On organic growth, it looks like you came in nearly 2 points above your peers.  I was just wondering if there is anything anomalous or temporary that might be driving growth higher?  And then, second, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about utilization?  How is it trending?  Can you relate it to the 50 bips rise in temp help to revenues?  Thank you.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Well, you know, I think the organic increase is an indication as I said, of our strong offerings and our performance of our agencies.  Our comp is a little bit different than some of our competitors, but that doesnt take away from the fact that we had very strong organic performance, and its a result across the board, as I said, of our sectors as well as our agencies.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And with respect to utilization, Bill, Ill just comment on overall margin target.  The margin targets that we put out were predicated on our budget.  When we look at the first quarter, our performance was at or better than budget across the board for the most part.  So, we still feel pretty confident in our 2011 margin targets.
 
:
Mr. Bird
And just specifically on temp help, I was wondering, what drove that increase, and is that something you expect to be sustaining?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
We look at base and temp together, and the two combined had fairly dramatic improvement in operating leverage for the quarter.  So, again, its an area that we were 4% plus to revenue in the quarter  which is high; you know, its an area that our operators need to continue to focus on because we think, believe, it needs to be below 4%  but a lot of it is tied to just increased business activity.
 
:
Mr. Bird
And, can you just clarify what youre seeing on incentive comp?  You were clear in indicating it will come down as a percent of revenues, was there some kind of timing issue or something that pulled it forward a little bit?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
It was  the first-quarter was pretty much in line with what we expected.  And theres two components of it.  One is for efficiency and cost reduction.  Theres also a component for utilizing and being opportunistic in bringing in new talent.  But, we still think a 1% of revenue is probably a reasonable number for the year.  Could it be a bit higher?  It could, but I dont think its going to be, I dont think its going to be higher than that.

:
Mr. Roth
Yes, on the incentive side we did have some timing issues in the fourth  in the first quarter because of our long-term incentive was pushed forward a month.  And obviously our share price appreciation affected that number as well.  So, on the incentive side, were using 3.5% to 4% for the full-year basis, even though the first quarter was 4.4% or something like that.

Hey, good morning, guys.  Im just going to move away from the quarter and to something that was brought up at the analyst day and just would like to get your thoughts on going forward, and thats performance-based pricing, which was talked about a great deal by Mediabrands.  And, Im interested to hear about how you view that model, differentiating IPG in the market, and also the potential of seeing it at some of the other agencies, particularly McCann, where obviously the new management team has a history at Mediabrands.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  and I read your comment and your note and you raised it there and thank you for that  look, we still think thats the opportunity, and we spoke a lot about it at Mediabrands because Mediabrands, their business lends itself to performance-based compensation a lot easier.  And, frankly, our clients in that arena seem to be embracing it better.  You know, all Im saying is that we continue to push for it, obviously in Mediabrands its an important part of how they view their strategic advantage, if you will, going forward in terms of willing to put skin in the game and assume performance-based compensation will be better for us as we go forward.
 
But, I think, long-term, I think performance-based compensation is going to be the way to go for our industry.  I think it puts us in a very solid position with respect to our clients, and the key there is going to be making sure that we have the analytics that are satisfactory to both the client as well as us in terms of the measurements.  So, we havent seen all of a sudden since the Investor Day, a rash of performance-based compensation contracts, but it continues to be an important focus in our negotiations with our clients as we move forward.  Because I think its a very effective way for us to get to the margins that I think this industry should be operating in.
 
:
Mr. Salmon
And, from the sounds of it, thats  you mentioned that Mediabrands lends itself, particularly well there, but do you expect to see that becoming a bigger part of some of the other agencies as well?
 
 
13
 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes. We already have incentive  we already have incentive comp performance in our contracts.  And of course, at Draftfcb, behavioral-based marketing is in their DNA.  So, their model lends itself to performance-based compensation as well.  So yes, I dont think its going to be unique to the media offerings.  I believe its going to be throughout.  And, obviously, McCann has spent a fair amount of investment in the analytics.  Its part of their integrated offering, particular with the multinational clients that theyre dealing with.  So, I view that as an important component of our margin improvement going forward.

And our next question comes from James Dix with Wedbush.
 
,:
James Dix
 
Wedbush Securities
Good morning, gentlemen.  Just, I guess, three questions.  First, very strong international growth in the quarter, well above what I was expecting, I think what others were expecting.  You touched, Michael, on a couple of key geographic trouble spots, I guess, going forward.  If you could give any color on the other areas and whether we should be looking for any material changes in the strong growth outlook that you saw in 1Q in some of those other areas, such as in the Asia-Pacific or Latin America?  And then, I guess, secondly, I suppose maybe more for Frank, do you see any differences in incremental margins, either by geography or by discipline that we should be thinking about, just as we think about your progression towards that 9.5% to 10%, you know, goal for the year?  For example international growth: does that help you more towards your current target or is that more of a red herring?  And then I have just one follow-up.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.  Obviously we are exciting about whats happening in Latin America, China and India.  We have very strong offerings across all of our multinational clients there as well as local.  So, particularly in Brazil, we have a strong offering.  Obviously the transaction that we did at McCann with W/Olivetto is very effective, and were very pleased with the results of that.  Draftfcb and Lowe both have very strong offerings as well as Weber Shandwick and our other marketing services.  So Latin America performed extremely well  not quite the 40% growth that we saw last year, but obviously the comp was a lot different.  But nonetheless, it was strong double-digit, and we expect to see continued growth in Latin America.
 
 
14
 
 
The same is true for India.  We think India is a very important component of our growth plans, and there, too, we have a very strong media offering as well as our multinational clients and agencies that are present there :Draftfcb, McCann and Lowe.
 
And China were seeing strong performance.  We view China as an opportunity for us.  As Ive said before, were a little bit behind our competition in terms of our presence in China, but weve made  were making a strong effort to increase our presence in China and our expectation is to continue that increase and follow the strong performance that were seeing over there.
 
On the margins, Frank ?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
James, theres nothing in the revenue mix in Q1 or our view for the back half of the year that changes our view that the 30% conversion on incremental revenue is still a reasonable number.
 
:
Mr. Dix
Okay, great.  And then just one follow-up.  You talked a little bit about Mediabrands and their compensation structure.  Could you talk just a little bit about the growth youre seeing in media buying and planning, generally?  Some of your peers have talked about some pretty strong growth.  I presume youre seeing that at Mediabrands. But if you could confirm that, and then, just what is your outlook for that discipline going forward this year?  Especially as the ad recovery continues.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well as we indicated, Mediabrands, all the components of Mediabrands, Initiative as well as UM, had a very strong first quarter.  Buying  you have to split buying from planning  obviously buying is a more difficult market to enhance margins but its part of the integrated offering in media and therefore planning is that much more important.  Were very pleased  as you know, weve repositioned our offerings in Mediabrands on regions where we can compete so that we can bring all the offerings of Mediabrands to bear with respect to our client offerings.  And, thats having good traction in the marketplace.  We view our media offerings under the umbrella of Mediabrands as a critical component of our growth opportunity and our margin opportunities as we go forward.

And next is Tim Nollen with Macquarie.
 
Tim Nollen,
Macquarie
:
Hi, thanks.  I have three things, please.  First, on revenues, weve talked about this issue of comps a few times now already in this call.  And your peers have also, similar to you, said that they are quite optimistic on the pace of organic growth for the bulk of the year.  But, your comp shift into Q2 is very dramatic versus Q1.  You were minus 3% in Q1 last year and you were plus 8.5% in Q2.  So, just to apply the same type of growth rate from Q1 this year into Q2 would mean you would be down 1% in Q2, and yet youre talking a very positive story.  I just wonder if theres incremental spending from clients coming through thats going to fill in Q2, or what it is that makes you that optimistic that the numbers will stay high.  And this isnt just you, its your peers all saying the same thing, but its a starker contrast for you from Q1 into Q2.
 
Second question is, the working capital figure that you pointed to  and I noticed quite a sharp downturn there in the Q1 number versus Q1 last year  I know Q1 is always seasonally low on that, but I just wonder what was driving the figure this year versus last year.
 
And then, lastly, if you could please talk about net new business.  Even if you wont give a number, what the trend is, and what accounts we need to be aware of that are in play.  Thanks.
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Okay, Ill take two of them and Ill give the working capital to Frank.  Q1 versus Q2: look, we dont look at it  I know you have to model and you have to expect on a quarterly basis  we look at it on a year-over-year basis, and thats why when we say were comfortable with the 4% to 5% organic growth for the year, it takes into consideration the lumpiness, if you will, of how its spread on a quarterly basis.  So, whether it comes through on the second quarter or the third quarter, we think that number  were comfortable with that number.  And obviously, starting where we are in the first quarter is encouraging for us going forward.  The tone of our business  another way of answering your question   the tone of our business continues to be very solid.  So therefore, going into the second-quarter, theres no reason for us to believe that there is any reason for us not to be able to deliver on what were saying.  And how it falls out on a quarterly basis, well see. Okay?
 
As far as net new business, the one item  weve had three items, three companies in review that everyone was watching.  One was Microsoft, we know the result for that in terms of retaining some of the business and losing the North American side.  The Army  McCann retained the Army.  And the other one is SC Johnson, which as you know we are defending, and we hope to see results probably either in the second quarter or early part of the third quarter.  So, in terms of net new business, we should see the impact of the Microsoft loss affecting us in the second half of the year.  And as far as the rest goes there are a couple of other pitches out there that we are in the finals on, and we hope to be successful in those.

 On the working capital, Frank 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
With respect to working capital, Tim, the significant use in Q1 is attributable to the significant generation in Q4.  Theyre directly correlated.  When you take a look at Q1 cash use as a percentage of Q4 cash generated, its right in line with what we normally would have expected.

And our next question comes from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
 
,
Peter Stabler
 
Wells Fargo Securities
Good morning, thanks very much for taking the question.  Michael, you mentioned at the Investor Day complexity and confusion being a friend.   You brought it up again today.  Im wondering if you could step back and just elaborate a little bit on that.  I tend to agree, and my conversations with agencies and clients that this is an ongoing trend.  Help us understand whether this is a positive trend.  Can we enter a period of greater, secular growth even if it is marginally greater than we saw over the last, lets say, decade on a normalized basis?  Is increasing complexity and confusion leading to an increase in activity and creation of assets by your agencies, or is it just more of a market condition that you cant really quantify or address in terms of growth targets, et cetera?  Thanks very much.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
I think its a fair question, and yes Ive said it a few times.  No, I think it adds to growth in terms of our opportunities.  Just look at whats happened with social media, okay?  You get an entire new market that opens up, clients are hearing a lot about it at cocktail parties, thats all they talk about.  The CEOs attend the cocktail party, and they all come back and say what are we doing about social media?  And, what we have to do is be ahead of the curve in terms of investing in assets and having people who can answer those questions for our clients as part of the integrated offering that were providing.  So, we have a whole new areas of expertise.  And, whats great about it, in social media, for example, it crosses all of our disciplines.  So, certainly our integrated offerings in terms of our networks have social media capabilities.  Our independent agencies have social media capabilities, and our PR agencies are where you would logically think social media plays a very important role.  Its a very important growth
opportunity, and, in fact, they are delivering on it in terms of their results.  So thats just one example.
 
 
 
17
 
 
The other part of it is, our clients have to figure out where do they spend their marketing dollars.   And, thats where our expertise comes into play.  We have to be able to look at a total solution for our clients in terms of where they spend their dollars, where do they get their best bang for the buck.  And its incumbent upon us to have the expertise to help them do that, to analyze the effect of that and basically, ultimately our compensation on the performance of that will be decided.  So, I think it is a pretty exciting place for us to be as these new media opportunities in these new areas grow, if were ahead of the curve and participate in that, every time we are asked to be in front of our client, its an opportunity for show  telling them and showing them our expertise in how we can help them move the needle.  So, you know its incumbent upon us to be ready, willing and able to help them and be ahead of the curve and for them to ask.  And, because its so confusing, its impossible for all of our clients to have that kind of expertise internally.  So, I think its a huge opportunity for our industry.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
Thanks, I have a quick one for Frank.  Could you tell us year-over-year headcount changes in terms of gross bodies?  And then could you remind me: the event marketing pass-through costs, what line do those show up in?

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
The headcount change, Peter, its 4% year-over-year, 1% for the quarter.  So, we added 1% over the last three months.  And the past-through costs go through the O&G bucket.  And the year-on-year pass-through costs change is de minimus.

,:
Matt Chesler
 
Deutsche Bank Securities
Good morning.  As I look at your historical results, its now been four quarters in which youve grown faster than the rest of your peers.  So, admittedly though, youre predicting that the sustainability of, you know, the ad market strength is getting more complex, but what do you think is preventing or holding back the ratings agencies from taking a more constructive view?
 
 
18
 
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
You know  wed like to know the answer that, too, by the way; its our view that we should be already there  you know, weve always answered this question, we have meetings, weve had meetings, and we have meetings coming up.  And obviously they have Fitch already has us as investment grade; the other two have us on positive you know, they are waiting to see, as you point out, consistency.  We already showed fourth-quarter  I would suspect that you know theyll look to see how we perform for this year.  And, I dont think they have to, but they may.  And, hopefully after they see a strong performance for the year, well see action on their part.  But frankly, I agree with you, I think all of us agree with you.  Weve had four good solid results, weve shown our ability to manage our business.  Certainly from a competitive point of view, our organic growth shows were competitive.  Weve shown the ability to leverage the revenue and convert, and our balance sheet is as strong as its ever been, and so, I dont see, frankly, any reason why they shouldnt and will continue to push them to see it the same way.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
So youre saying it might be premature to expect that, you know, the four quarters is enough or what the trajectory is enough right now?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Matt, probably, at best case, an upgrade at the end of this year.  More likely, there could be an interim move between where we are now and investment grade because there still is one more notch.  But we would expect if we deliver on our current targets that early next year would probably be a more reasonable time.
 
:
Mr. Roth
I also suspect the rating agencies, you know the rating agencies in the past have had issues on timing things and you know with the uncertainty in the global environment right now, they may use that as a reason to hold back as well.  So, you know, its not up to us, we can make the case, we certainly strongly believe that we should be there.  And, I think at the appropriate time theyll take the action.  But, nonetheless, I think the way to look at us as a rating perspective, is we think we are already are there and therefore our performance and frankly our pricing should reflect that.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
They were all at the Investor Day.  The feedback was very positive.  In fact S&P gave us credit watch positive coming out of that meeting.  So, all things are pointing in the right direction.  To Michaels point, its probably now just more a matter of timing and internal process.
 
 
19
 
 
:
Mr. Chesler
So were assuming its just a matter of timing.  Ive always viewed your cash balance, you know, your balance sheet as including some, you know, I dont know if its insurance cash or cash that you need to hold because you dont have access to the commercial paper markets, the way that you would.  You know, lets just presume that you get the ratings upgrade and you can access the commercial paper balance, what do you think that does to the amount of cash that you think you need to hold onto the balance sheet?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well obviously that financial flexibility helps us do a whole bunch of things.  And, obviously we are looking at all of that.  Again, one question that well follow from that, do we see any huge acquisitions out there that we would leverage up to do and, frankly, we havent seen any.  Were not missing any huge offerings if you will.  We will continue to do, Ill answer one of the questions Im sure one of you has in terms of what we see in the acquisition environment, and you know we put out the $150 million number as a stake in the ground and we continue to see some transactions, well announce a couple of small specialty transactions coming up as we said we would.  But, we will be opportunistic on the acquisition side, in the digital and the emerging markets.
 
The rest is just financial modeling and financial opportunities for us and the more you have in flexibility, the more things we can do.  Commercial paper, obviously, would be helpful.  And that would enable us to free up some excess cash thats on the balance sheet.  I think weve shown that were willing  I think the announcement of the dividend and the share buyback is a good example of how we view our responsibility to our shareholders is, if we have too much cash on our balance sheet is to return it in a thoughtful way.  So, as our financial flexibility expands, then we will continue to look at how the best way to enhance our shareholder value.

Yes, good morning.  Housekeeping question first, on foreign exchange.  Given that you guys are in about 100 countries around the world, if rates stayed where theyre at right now for the rest of the year, how would you expect foreign currency to impact your numbers for the second-quarter and also for the full year?

For the full year, relatively flat.  Im not in a position to give you a Q2 number right now, Craig.
 
:
Mr. Huber
Okay, then also, just can you elaborate further on your comments on Continental Europe?  I mean, your organic growth there the last two quarters I guess is between 2% to 4%.  I mean, given the various cross currents, small markets there versus large, proximity to the Middle East et cetera, slower economies, do you think thats a decent expectation  2% to 4% organic growth in Continental Europe for you guys for the next three quarters?
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
You know, if you would have  at the beginning of the year, I would have thought that would be on the high side to be honest with you.  I think given the results in the first quarter, probably 2% is a number that would be, if we deliver that, 2% to 4% I think that would be a good year and Im encouraged to see that.  But again, that one is very hard to predict.  There are a lot of things that are going on there, were just encouraged by what were seeing in the first quarter.  And, ask the question again in the second quarter, Ill have a better answer for you.
 
:
Mr. Huber
Okay then also, for your auto category just generally speaking, how did that perform revenue-wise, organic growth year-over-year in the quarter?  And, what are those clients generally telling you about their outlook for their auto marketing and advertising spend for the rest of year?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes, our auto category  whats encouraging about our auto category is it continues to be very positive.  The growth is in the double-digit numbers, and its a number of auto clients that are contributing.  As you know we had some new clients last year, and thats contributing to our growth, and we continue to see the spend there.  So, were encouraged by what were seeing.  We havent seen any big pullbacks as a result of supply issues with respect to production, and we expect to see that to continue.  Its a very competitive environment out there, and they have to spend marketing dollars to sell cars.

Albert Fried & Company
:
Thank you very much for taking my questions.  Congratulation on a solid quarter.  10% revenue growth: very solid, absolute, relative basis.  As you alluded to before, during the quarter, you know there are several new account wins.  Hasbro and Sony, would you say that the performance-based marketing contributed to those wins in some shape or form?  And are these performance-based accounts?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
I wont comment on how we structure our compensation by client, and I would say you dont get the compensation unless you get to the finals and youre pretty well there.  So, I wouldnt say the compensation, performance-based compensation, is the reason for a win, but it certainly helps in narrowing any gap there might be in terms of the expectation on pricing.  But, unless we have the offering, from a professional point of view, no matter what your pricings going to be youre not going to win the business.  So, our approach is, put together the best team you can with the best offering you have, get to the finals and then start talking about compensation.  And, if you need to bridge the gap and the performance-based compensation does that, were there.
 
Mr.
Tullo
:
Okay.  And, in regards to Asia-Pacific, and specifically Japan, you know, how is that market going?  Are we having discussions, you know, about reduced spend or are they holding tight?  What is the status at this point in time?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, as I indicated, frankly we had a positive quarter in the first-quarter in Japan, but unfortunately because of the events, theres no doubt thats going to be pulled back for the rest of the year. There are two components.  Theres the local spending and then theres the multinational spending within Japan.  And we participate in both.  I think the one that will be most adversely affected will be the local spend, and therefore were not projecting any growth in Japan.  And as far as the multinational spend, were watching that carefully.  But we still see spend in those markets.
 
Mr.
Tullo
:
And, in regards to Facebook, if you were to sell that stake at some point this year, are you more inclined to return the proceeds to shareholders, pay back buy back debt? Or make acquisitions?  Or a little bit of all?
 
:
Mr. Roth
We dont look at our programs on a discrete basis.   Well look at our overall balance sheet, well look at our available cash and well look at the best way to enhance shareholder value, and if it means increasing the dividend or buyback, or doing something else, we will do it.  But, you can be assured that well be looking at the best way to enhance shareholder value, because thats what our responsibilities are.
 
Mr.
Tullo
:
And just as a follow up with Frank, is it safe to assume that $30 million to $40 million in a normal cash flow environment would be a kind of a run rate on the buyback program?
 
 
22
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We announced, Richard, that the buyback program approved by our Board was $300 million, and we didnt put a timeline on when we would execute the complete program.  As I indicated in my comments earlier, we set daily and weekly targets, predicated on cash flow projections.  Q1 is normally our weakest cash flow quarter.  As cash flow generation increases, as it seasonally, normally does, you can expect us to be more aggressive with respect to that program.
