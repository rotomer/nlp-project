Dividends
 
Each holder of shares of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock (together, the Holders) shall be entitled, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of assets of the Company legally available therefor, to receive cumulative dividends at the initial rate per annum of 5.25% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 19(ii) hereof (such liquidation preference, as adjusted from time to time, the Liquidation Preference) (initially equivalent to $52.50 per annum per share) payable quarterly in arrears (such rate, as the same may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section 2(ii) and Section 13, the Dividend Rate).  Dividends payable for each full dividend period will be computed by dividing the Dividend Rate by four and shall be payable in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date (commencing January 15, 2006) for the quarterly period ending immediately prior to such Dividend Payment Date, to the holders of record of Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business on the Dividend Record Date applicable to such Dividend Payment Date.  Such dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as to which dividends shall have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the Issue Date (whether or not in any dividend period or periods there shall be assets of the Company legally available for the payment of such dividends in whole or in part).  The initial dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, for the period commencing on October 24, 2005, to but excluding January 15, 2006, shall be $11.8125 per share and shall be payable, when, as and if declared, on January 15, 2006.  Each subsequent quarterly dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared, shall be $13.125 per share.  Dividends payable for any partial dividend period, including the initial dividend period ending immediately prior to January 15, 2006, shall be computed on the basis of days elapsed over a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(i)
 
If and whenever six full quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, payable on the Series B Preferred Stock (such period, the Initial Six-Quarter Period) are not paid, then the Dividend Rate shall increase by one percentage point (100 basis points), and at such date as the Company has paid in full all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to such date, the Dividend Rate shall decrease by one percentage point (100 basis points).  After the Initial Six-Quarter Period and the taking of action by the Company to cause a decrease in the Dividend Rate as provided in the prior sentence, if and whenever one full quarterly dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock is not paid, the Dividend Rate shall increase by one percentage point (100 basis points) until the Company has paid in full all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to the date on which the accumulated and unpaid dividends are paid in full.
(ii)
 
No dividend will be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart or shares of Common Stock distributed for the payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to any dividend period unless all dividends for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid or declared and a sufficient sum of money or number of shares of Common Stock have been set apart or shares of Common Stock distributed for the payment of such dividend, upon all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
(iii)
 
No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 17 hereof) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or are declared and a sum of cash or number of shares of Common Stock sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid pro rata so that the amounts of dividends declared per share on the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.
(iv)

Holders shall not be entitled to any dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends calculated pursuant to this Section 2.

(i)
 
Shares of Series B Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion during the period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by a payment in cash equal to the dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock on that Dividend Payment Date.  A Holder on a Dividend Record Date who (or whose transferee) tenders any shares for conversion on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall receive the dividend payable by the Company on the Series B Preferred Stock on that date, and the converting holder shall not be required to include payment in the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion.  Except as provided in this Section 6(ii), upon a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to this Section 6, the Company shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock or for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion.
(ii)

Immediately prior to the close of business on the date of receipt by the Company or its duly appointed Transfer Agent of notice of conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, each converting Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holders Series B Preferred Stock notwithstanding that the share register of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such Holder.

(d)
Cash Distributions

However, if the Company elects to change the conversion right in connection with a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change as described in this Section 9 and that such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change ultimately is not consummated, then the Company shall not be obligated to give effect to that particular election.

           SECTION 2.06       . (a)  (1)  The Board of Directors may fix the record date in order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of a meeting of stockholders, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date may not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.  If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors in its discretion may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this clause (a)(1) at the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed pursuant to this clause (a)(1), the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
Record Date
 
(2)       Except as otherwise provided in clause (a)(1) or clause (b) of this Section 2.06, the Board of Directors may fix a record date in order to determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action.  If no record date is fixed pursuant to this clause (a)(2), the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto
.
(b)       
The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors or as otherwise established under this Section 2.06(b). Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation and delivered to the Corporation and signed by a stockholder of record, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written notice must contain the information set forth in Section 2.06(c). Following receipt of the notice, the Board of Directors shall have ten (10) days to determine the validity of the request, and if appropriate, adopt a resolution fixing the record date for such purpose. The record date for such purpose shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board fails within ten (10) days after the Corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by applicable Delaware law; except that, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required under the provisions of Delaware law, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

The Corporation may require the stockholder requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish additional information to the extent it may reasonably be required to determine the validity of the request for a record date.

Such list shall be opened to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

           SECTION 2.08       Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, at any meeting of stockholders the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for, and the votes of the holders of a majority of the shares so present shall be required for, the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice, other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
Quorum.
 
           SECTION 2.09       Any meeting of stockholders, including a meeting at which a quorum is not present, may be adjourned to another time or place by the votes of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. Notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, except that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Order of Business.
 
           SECTION 2.11       Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, every stockholder of record, as determined pursuant to Section 2.06 hereof, shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock held by such stockholder on the record date. All elections of directors shall be by written ballot, but no vote on any other question upon which a vote of the stockholders may be taken need be by ballot unless the chairman of the meeting shall so decide or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to participate in such vote shall so demand. In a vote by ballot each ballot shall state the number of shares voted and the name of the stockholder or proxy voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by Section 3.15 hereof, all elections of directors that are contested elections, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote.  All other questions (including the election of directors other than in a contested election) shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the question.  A contested election means an election of directors for which (i) the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors that was timely made in accordance with the applicable nomination periods provided in these By-Laws, and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the 10th day before the Corporation first mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors.  If directors are to be elected by a plurality vote, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. Incumbent directors running for reelection in an uncontested election who fail to receive the required vote shall, to the extent permitted by law, resign within 120 days after the election.
Vote of Stockholders.
 
           SECTION 2.12       Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy acting for any stockholder shall be duly appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder.

(2)            For business (including the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Section 2.13(a)(1)(C) of these By-Laws, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary that complies in form and substance with the requirements of these By-Laws and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action.  To be timely, a stockholders notice (including the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or of a new record date for an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice shall be valid and effective only if it is timely given (as set forth above) and only if it sets forth (A) as to any business (including the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation, in which case the questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 2.13(d) of these By-Laws must also be delivered along with and at the same time as such stockholders notice) that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, any material interest (whether by holdings of securities, by virtue of being a creditor or contractual counterparty of the Company or of a third party, or otherwise) in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal to conduct such business is made and, if such business includes a proposal to amend either the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the text of the proposed amendment; and (B) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal to conduct such business (including the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation) is made, (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporations books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, (iii) any agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into by such stockholder, such beneficial owner or their respective affiliates with respect to equity securities of the Corporation, including any put or call arrangements, derivative securities, short positions, borrowed shares or swap or similar arrangements, specifying in each case the effect of such agreements, arrangements or understandings on any voting or economic rights of equity securities of the Corporation, in each case as of the date of the notice and in each case describing any changes in voting or economic rights which may arise pursuant to the terms of such agreements, arrangements or understandings, (iv) to the extent not covered by clauses (ii) and (iii), any disclosures that would be required pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D if the requirements therein were applicable to such stockholder and such beneficial owner and (v) an undertaking by such stockholder and such beneficial owner to notify the Corporation in writing of any change in the information called for by clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) as of the record date for such meeting, by notice received by the Secretary not later than the 10th day following such record date, and thereafter by notice so given and received within two business days of any change in such information and, in any event, as of the close of business on the day preceding the meeting date. For the avoidance of doubt, even if the Corporation has already included the election or reelection of directors as an item on the agenda for the annual meeting or already included any other subject matter as an item on the agenda for the annual meeting, a stockholder shall not be permitted to nominate any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation at such annual meeting or place any proposal relating to such subject matter on the agenda for such annual meeting (other than business properly included in the Corporations proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), unless, in each case, such stockholder complies with the advance notice requirements set forth in this Section 2.13(a)(2), including as to the timing and substance of such notice requirements.

Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting as provided for in Section 2.04 hereof. The nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this Section 2.13(b), who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice provisions set forth in this Section 2.13(b), including the provisions as to timing of the delivery of the notice of any nomination of a director for election or reelection and required information.  In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing or reelecting one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporations notice of meeting, if the stockholder delivers the notice required by Section 2.13(a)(2) of these By-Laws along with and at the same time as the questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 2.13(d) of these By-Laws to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or of a new record date for a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice requirements applicable to a stockholders proposal to conduct other business at a meeting of stockholders (excluding a nomination of a person for election as a director) shall be deemed to be satisfied by a stockholder, if such stockholder has submitted to the Corporation a proposal in compliance with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and such proposal has been included in the Corporations proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies for the applicable meeting of stockholders.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the presiding officer of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws and, if any proposed business is not in compliance with these By-Laws, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.

(3)       Without limiting the applicability of the other provisions of these By-Laws, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these By-Laws. Except for the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Actions other than those by or in the right of the Corporation.
 
 
16
 
 
           SECTION 6.02       The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. The foregoing sentence to the contrary notwithstanding, no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Actions by or in the right of the Corporation.
 
           SECTION 6.03       To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
Indemnification against Expenses.
 
           SECTION 6.04       Any indemnification under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02, and that he has reasonably cooperated with the Corporation in the conduct of such action, suit or proceeding. Such determination shall be made (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders.

           SECTION 6.05       . Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a present or former director, officer, employee or agent in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if the following conditions are met: (a) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such present or former director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article 6 and (b) (1) in the case of a person who is a director or officer at the time of such authorization, such advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) is authorized (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders; or (2) in the case of a person who is a former director or officer or a present or former employee or agent, such expenses (including attorneys fees) are so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.
Payment of Expenses in Advance of Final Disposition
 
 
17
 
 
           SECTION 6.06       The indemnification provided by this Article 6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Non-Exclusivity.
 
           SECTION 6.07       The provisions of this Article 6 shall not be construed to authorize indemnification in any case or for any liability or expense where such indemnification would not be lawful. They shall be applicable to claims, actions, suits and proceedings made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after the date of such adoption. If a person meets the requirements of this Article 6 with respect to some matters in a claim, action, suit or proceeding but not with respect to others, he shall be entitled to indemnification as to the former.
Application.
 
 
 
           SECTION 7.01       Unless otherwise forbidden by law, every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman of the Board, the Co-Chairman of the Board, the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or such other officer specified by the Board of Directors, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation.  If such certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

The Board of Directors or the officer or officers thereunto duly authorized by the board may, in its, his or their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such new certificate, require such owner or legal representative to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
