As a result of the cumulative effect of (1) the cash dividend on common stock declared on May 26, 2011 by the Board of Directors of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG or the Company), payable on June 24, 2011 to holders of record as of June 10, 2011, and (2) the common stock cash dividend paid on March 25, 2011, the number of shares of IPG common stock into which certain of the Companys convertible securities may be converted have been adjusted in accordance with their terms.
 
The applicable conversion rates for IPGs 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.25% Notes) and 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.75% Notes) have been adjusted as follows:
 
 
The conversion rate with respect to the 4.25% Notes and the 4.75% Notes is the number of IPG common shares into which each $1,000 principal amount of notes may be converted, which as adjusted represents a conversion price of approximately $12.30 per conversion share.
 
The conversion rate with respect to the Companys 5/% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock has not been adjusted because the applicable threshold before adjustment is required has not been reached.
