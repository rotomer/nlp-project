Summary
 
 
 
 
The strength of our professional offerings is evident in our 6.8% organic revenue growth for the first half of the year, despite very challenging comparisons.  For the six months, all geographic world regions and all of our major global networks posted organic growth, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublics Chairman and CEO.  Profitability in the second quarter reflects that our current results compare to a second quarter of 2010 that saw very strong revenue gains, but low expense growth as well as continued investment behind growth areas of our business.  Our focus for the balance of this year will be on margin enhancement.  We remain confident that we will achieve our full year 2011 target of 4-5% organic growth, deliver at least 9.5% operating margin and further enhance shareholder value.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Interpublic Group second quarter and first half of 2011 earnings conference call. . . .  I would like to introduce [Jerry] Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning.  Jerry Leshne.  Thank you for joining us.
 
We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and will refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We plan to conclude before market open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.
 
 
,:
Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2011.  As always, Ill provide an overview, hand it off to Frank for an in-depth look at the results, then return with some commentary on the agencies before we turn the call over for Q&A.
 
As youve seen in our report this morning, Q2 organic revenue growth was 4.7%.  Our operating profit in the quarter was $174 million, compared to $177 million a year ago, and operating margin was 10%, compared with 11% in Q210.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.19, ahead of last years $0.15 a share.
 
Because 2010 was a very strong growth year for us, our comps are quite challenging.  And that accounts, in part, for the moderation in our overall growth rates.  The second-quarter organic revenue result of 4.7% is on top of last years industry-leading Q2 result of 8.5%.
 
Likewise, in the U.S., our second-quarter organic growth was 4.2%, on top of 13.6% growth in the second quarter of 2010.  Two events hurt our U.S. organic revenue growth by 2.5% in the quarter: the loss of an account in the auto sector last year, as well as the winding down of the census work this year.
 
 
 
 
We were pleased to see international organic growth of 5.5%.  From a sector perspective, growth was led by clients in the health & personal care and auto industries.  And, while worldwide revenue grew in June, the largest month in the quarter, outside North America, June revenue was not as strong as we had anticipated.
 
Turning to costs, our results reflect the fact that were comping against the first half of 2010 that saw strong revenue gains, but low expense growth.  At the same time, we continued to make investments in payroll during the quarter to support growth in areas of our business, notably in the areas of digital, strategic insights and creative capabilities.
 
We are confident that continued, disciplined investment in the quality of our people and our offerings will support the resumption of strong margin growth in the second half of this year.  This long-standing commitment to investing in our talent has been a major driver in the success of our turnaround to date.
 
In fact, we just completed our mid-year operating reviews with all our major business units, and the tone of the business is strong, notwithstanding the June monthly result.  Given our first-half organic revenue growth of 6.8%, which is fully competitive with our peer group, combined with what were hearing from our clients and from our agency leadership, we remain confident that we will achieve our organic growth target of 4% to 5% for the full year.
 
Clients remain focused on growth and are looking to us for help in maximizing the value they can drive with their brands.  The consumer and media landscape remains extremely complex, and the importance of marketing will only continue to increase.  There is also beginning to be a pickup in new business activity, notably in the media arena.
 
During the second quarter, our costs and revenue fell out of step, but we see this as an interim result, and all of our operating units will be highly focused on margin enhancement during the back half of 2011.
 
This is why we also continue to believe we will deliver at least 9.5% operating margin for this year.  Our goal of sustained margin expansion to fully competitive profitability within the next few years, which we set out in detail at our Investor Day, remains unchanged.
 
Before closing, I want to update you on other key developments that have taken place since our last call which demonstrate confidence in the long-term prospects of our company.
 
During the second quarter, we were pleased to receive upgrades from both Moodys and S&P.  Moodys took us up two notches, to investment grade, where Fitch already had us.  S&P upgraded IPG to one notch below investment grade.  These actions further validate the great progress weve made in terms of the financial strength and performance of our company.
 
 
2
 
In terms of share repurchase program, the second quarter was the first full quarter under the authorization granted by our Board in late February, and we repurchased approximately 11 million common shares, using approximately $130 million, during the quarter.  That brings us to 12 million shares and $139 million since the inception of the program.  This activity underscores that we believe that IPG represents a long-term opportunity for significant value creation and are, therefore, moving to deploy our capital to increase returns for our shareholders.
 
At this point, let me turn things over to Frank for an in-depth review of the quarter and the year to-date.
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 
On slide two, youll see an overview of the quarter, which tracks some of the points that Michael just made:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to slide three, you see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides to follow.  Its worth noting that our Q2 effective tax rate was 30.5%, primarily reflecting a benefit in the quarter related to the conclusion of prior-period tax audits.
 
Turning to operations on slide four, beginning with revenue:
 
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
 
 
On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments:
 
 
 
Moving on to slide five, which provides a look at revenue by region:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
 
On slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-12-month basis.  The most recent data point of 8.7% reflects Q2 2011 and the roll-off of Q2 last year.
 
On slide seven, we took a closer look at operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On slide eight, as usual, we show an adjusted operating margin history on a trailing-12-month basis, which was 8.3% as at the end of Q2, a slight decrease from the end of Q1.  Margin expansion to fully competitive levels within the next few years continues to be our primary financial objective.
 
On slide nine, we turn to cash flow for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 10:
 
 
 
6
 
 
 
On slide 11 you see our debt maturity schedule as of June 30:
 
 
 
In summary, on slide 12, for both the quarter and the half year, we continue to see revenue growth rates that support our financial targets for the full year and will support our longer-term financial objectives.
 
We are budgeting significantly slower operating expense growth during the second half of the year.  With the 4% to 5% organic growth we are expecting for the full year, our second-half targets are for approximately 200 basis points of leverage compared to last years second half.  This should come roughly evenly from 100 basis points on salaries and related expenses and 100 basis points on our office and general expenses.
 
If you look at the change in our operating expenses last year, it makes sense that expense growth should decrease dramatically in the second half of the year.  Last year, operating expenses decreased 1% organically in the first half, and increased over 8% in the second half.  This primarily reflects the course of re-staffing following the recession.  As a result, the expense comparison, if you will, was more challenging in the first half of this year, but will ease in the second half.
 
Given our seasonality, in which the fourth quarter is the largest of the year, the fourth quarter has always figured very importantly in our margin growth for the past few years.  We expect it to do this again in 2011.
 
Now, Id like to turn the call back over to Michael.

Mr. Roth
Thank you, Frank.

In reviewing the quarter and the year to date, there are a number of themes that emerge.  The strength of our professional offerings remains evident in our 6.8% first-half organic revenue growth that is near the top of our peer group, even though we were facing the toughest comps in our sector and slower-than-expected growth in June.  Also, for the first six months, all geographic world regions posted organic revenue growth, as did all of our major global networks.
 
The competitiveness of our offering can be seen across the board.  You have only to look at how effectively our media agencies go to market, whether its in the global pitches or against specialist agencies for digital assignments.  Mediabrandss new Emerging [Media] Lab in New York and their new global cluster organization will make them even more attractive to forward-thinking marketers.
 
The Draftfcb integrated model has contributed to making it among the strongest top-line contributors from our portfolio.  The agency has been successfully upgrading its top creative talent in a number of key markets, and the global management team is highly disciplined and proven when it comes to delivering results.
 
Were seeing CMG continue to take share from the competition, particularly in the PR space, where Weber Shandwick is a dominant player, building exceptional social media expertise, and where the recent agency redesign at GolinHarris is defining the PR agency model for the future.  Strong collaboration at Octagon, Jack Morton, and FutureBrand is also part of the CMG success story.
 
Were also seeing strong revenue growth and international expansion at R/GA, HUGE and McCanns MRM.  Our U.S. independents continue to perform well, led by The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday, and Mullen.  And Lowe keeps on delivering for its largest multinational clients and winning new assignments from them.
 
At McCann, we are pleased to see more senior-level executives join the organization.  There continues to be an influx of people in the creative area, in account leadership roles and among its market leaders.  This type of investment is re-invigorating the Worldgroup and will allow us to leverage its unrivaled roster of multinational clients.
 
The key for us, in the case of both McCann and the organization as a whole, will be to bring a high degree of focus for the remainder of this year to balancing investment and return.
 
Though our profitability at mid-year is ahead of where we were at this time in 2010, we are seeing signs that costs are out of step with revenue.  Were aware of the focus that is required on margin enhancement, and in recent years we have shown that we can successfully manage to margin targets.  And, as weve indicated in the past, this is a seasonal business, and we manage to the full year.
 
In looking forward to the rest of the year, we clearly have the right offerings and people to compete effectively in the marketplace.  We remain confident that we will achieve our 4% to 5% organic revenue growth objective for the year and at least 9.5% operating margin, which is consistent with the long-term plan for the business that we shared at Investor Day.  This level of performance, combined with targeted strategic M&A activity and a return of capital to our owners, will allow us to continue to deliver significant shareholder value appreciation.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
:
Operator
 
. . . .  Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with J.P. Morgan.  Your line is open.
 
, :
Alexia S. Quadrani
J.P. Morgan
Thank you.  Frank, could you provide a bit more detail on the revenues in the quarter?  Specifically, how significant was the drop-off in June?  And really, what was behind it?  Was it just some softness in the packaged goods category in June?  Was it one client specific, one region specific?  Any detail you can give us on June will be helpful.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Alexia, as you know, June is, by far, the largest month in the quarter.  And we were feeling pretty good through April, May.  And we did see June fall off  although there was growth.  Most of the fall off happened outside the U.S., and some of the sectors you called out were the drivers.  Some, especially in Latin America, we saw some revenue move out of the quarter, but in talking to the folks down there, our expectation is that theres not a pullback in spend, its just a timing issue.  And some of the markets in Europe were relatively soft in the fourth quarter  or in June.
 
Michael Roth, :
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Let me just comment on the tone, because its a relevant answer to your question, overall.  And, we do see this as interim, particularly, as Frank pointed out, in Brazil.  We view that, particularly in the packaged goods side, which accounted for the softness in that area, as a timing issue in Brazil.  As well as one or two clients that we were expecting some greater revenue, had some pullback in terms of government controls and so on.  So, we view this as a timing issue, which well make up in the back half of the year.
 
But, overall, the tone of the business continues to be solid.  And, frankly, obviously theres an overhang, if you will, in terms of whats happening in Washington, and in terms of the world economic platform.  But, Ive been meeting with a number of our clients and the leadership indicate that, even in this uncertainty, they still believe they have to invest behind their brands, which is why we believe for the rest of the year, well be able to deliver the results that we said we can.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
So basically, it sounds like its somewhat June-specific or somewhat, maybe, summer-specific, so we should see, maybe, a better revenue picture in the third quarter?  Is that what youre suggesting?  And then, the second part of that question is, since it seems like its most of the surprise weakness in June was outside the U.S., did McCann come in as expected?  Was McCann  I guess U.S. McCann Im talking to  did they continue to see healthy, or similar, growth in Q2 as they saw in Q1, adjusting for comparison?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, as we indicated, weve seen growth across all our global networks, okay?  And again, we cant answer questions on a quarterly basis.  All I can tell you is that we know from the pipeline that this revenue in the second half of the year, to be frank, whether it comes in the third quarter or fourth quarter, I cant comment on.  Obviously, we saw a miss, if you will, in this quarter.  But, were confident for the full year that it will happen.
 
 
10
 
 
With respect to McCann, we know there are a couple of wins in the pipeline that we cant announce yet, that will add to the indication of the talent having an impact in the marketplace for McCann.  So, were pleased with the direction that theyre heading in, and were confident that they will deliver according to what we think they should deliver for the full year.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
I guess, asking the question in a different way then, if we cant pinpoint the revenue recovery, whether its going to be Q3 or Q4  and I can understand that because, obviously, you dont have a crystal ball  have you adjusted the cost structure to assume that maybe the revenues dont come back in Q3?
 
:
Mr. Roth
No, I think  remember, we manage our business to the margins, Alexia.  And, as we said, given the level of 4% to 5%, which we think is consistent with where we will end up, we manage our margins, and when you add it all up, it comes out to at least 9.5%.  So therefore, by definition, the costs will come in line with the revenue.  And again, remember in the second half of the year, our comps in terms of expenses become easier than what we just went through.  And Frank just went through in detail how the buildup of the expenses was a mismatch to our revenue.  But, as we go through the year, they will fall in line with our objective.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
Okay.  And then, just a last question: should we assume that the rate of the buyback continues at the pace we saw in the quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
One of the questions in our last quarter was, everyone was disappointed in the fact that we had three weeks of buyback and we hadnt used it all up.  I think what youve seen is an indication that we believe in the shareholder value of returning cash to our shareholders.  And we view this is an opportunity.  So, I think you can assume we will continue to be active in the marketplace.  Again, consistent with an overall plan.  But, I think youve seen how our plan has been implemented in the past quarter, and, I think, you should expect that we will continue to keep shareholder value in mind as we move forward.

Ms. Quadrani
Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.  Your line is open.
 
 
11
 
 
, :
David Bank
RBC Capital Markets
Thanks.  Good morning, guys.
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Good morning, David.
 
:
Mr. Bank
I guess a little clarity  thanks for the detail on the sequential progression of the quarter.  I think you guys called out the tech and telecom category, and I was just wondering if there was any more specific color you could give around what drove the volatility.  And then, second, you highlighted two issues on the margin side.  One was the mismatch of, I guess really a mismatch of revenue and expenses, right?  So, if revenues had come in, maybe where you had expected them to in the first place, a tough question to ask, but, how different would margins have looked?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes, I mean, its a great question.  Let me put this whole thing in perspective for you, okay?  If you just look at our operating income number, which was $174 million, if we had added $26 million of incremental revenue, compared to $1.7 billion of total, we would have come in at a $200 million operating income number, and all these organic numbers and all our margin targets wouldve been met, okay?  So, in terms of order of magnitude, compared to where we are  granted, its not where we would have liked to have been because of the various items were talking about  were talking about $26 million, okay?  And, thats certainly within the range of an area over the next two quarters and the run rate that we certainly are comfortable that well make up.  So, I think its fair to look at  and if you also look at the increase in our salary and expense line, compared to last year, for example, we were up 3.5%.  But compared to the last quarter, we were up less than 1%.  So, its not that all of a sudden our expenses are ramping up.  It has so much to do with the comparison that we have to last year, okay?
 
So, we are on track, if you will, to achieve the numbers that were saying we are.  It just happens to be that they fell out of line in this quarter, and third quarter is still  were running into some issues on tracking that, but we look at it on a full-year basis.
 
On your question of tech and telecom, its a big sector for us.  Its over 20%.  So, we have at least five or six plusses in tech and telecom, and we have a few pullbacks in tech and telecom.  So that accounts for the fact that it was down.  And obviously, the plusses we hope to continue for the rest of the year.  And, for example, we were cycling through a small client that was acquired through merger.  And so we see those kind of things.  Its not that were falling out of bed here.  It just happens to be that in this particular quarter, some of the plusses and minuses came out not as we had scheduled them to fall throughout the quarter, if you would.

Very helpful.  Thanks, guys.

Mr.
Stabler
:
Good morning.  So, just a question about the guidance, 4% to 5% for the year.  If youre to take a midpoint there, it implies second half growth in the 3% range.  Can you offer a little bit more color on the trajectory here?  We all know the comps, and how steep they get, but are you seeing the tone of client conversations change?  3% would obviously reflect a rather marked deceleration from first half.  So, thats the first question.  Then, on the second question, just a little bit of clarification: you called out auto, 2.5% minus contribution from auto and another client.  Could you give us a sense of how that impacted IAN, specifically?  And can I assume that a majority of that auto is Chevrolet?
 
:
Mr. Roth
We dont like to call out clients, but you know our business pretty well, let me look at it that way.  And look, again, when we give the guidance of 4% to 5% for the overall year in terms of the revenue, then youre talking about a 3.5% to 4% organic for the second half of the year.  And that should  if you model it out, that will get to at least the 9.5% margin that were talking about, and we believe that thats a reasonable assumption to make.

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And, Peter, we expect our normal seasonality, where the fourth quarter is by far the strongest quarter.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
Ok, So, at this point, no indications  I know, Q4 is, we get it, heavily weighted to projects  but nothing really abnormally different in terms of the cycling of those conversations, or the timing of those conversations with clients right now?  I mean, were mid-July.  Visibility should be improving on Q4, correct?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Right.  We are cycling through some  what did we say, about 1% of headwinds in terms of organic?
 
 
13
 
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
For the two issues that you called out in the second quarter, the census work and the auto client, thats about 2% of headwind for the back half of the year.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
headwinds to IAN in this quarter, where the 3.9%, or is that not math you have?
And, very quickly, that 2.5% of headwinds in the U.S.  can you translate that into
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
The majority of it was IAN.
 
Mr.

Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Matt Chesler, Deutsche Bank.  Your line is open.
 
,:
Matt Chesler
 
Deutsche Bank Securities
Thanks for taking my call.  Maybe you can just further go into the nature of the misalignment between revenue and costs.  Are you suggesting that its only related to the revenue shortfall due to the items that you flagged?  Or is it also due to costs as well?  Just wondering the nature of those alignments.  Im sure the organization is maniacally focused on delivering their margin targets.  So, how did it get out of line?  When did you learn about it?  And, what are your levers as management to be able to ensure that they get back in line as were heading into the important part of the year for your margin build?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
I thought I went through that in terms of my other answer, but Ill briefly do it again.  The 2.5% that we referred to was on the revenue side.  And, remember  what Frank said and what I had just said  is that if you look at our expenses, there was a large growth last year, and a less, a slower ramping up of the expenses last year.  And then, in the back half of the year, we started ramping up those expenses.  So, our comps for the rest of the year on the expense level, since weve already spent and ramped up for this year, will become easier.  So, its a combination of the revenue side and the fact that our expense levels have leveled off.  Maybe thats another way of looking at it.  For the rest of the year, we dont expect to see that type of mismatch between revenue and expenses.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And, Matt, to repeat what Michael said earlier, if you look at sequentially what happened to our salary line from Q1 to Q2, the increase was de minimus.  So, its not as if we hired a whole boatload of people in the second quarter that got us misaligned.  And with respect to when did we know, as we said earlier, the first two months of the quarter from a revenue perspective were strong.  And June, which is the biggest month in the quarter, was weaker than we had expected.
 
 
14
 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Let me add to it, the fact that, obviously, June was a bit of a surprise to us, okay?  And so, as you can tell, we have done a great deal of analysis into what happened here.  So, we have an explanation for it.  We can explain it from a mathematical point of view.  But, the real issue is, from a tone point of view, was it a dramatic fall-off in our business?  And, the answer to that is no.  I mean, the tone of the business continues to be exactly as we stated.  And I think thats what we have to keep in mind.  And you made the point that were maniacal about watching the expenses.  The answer to that is, yes, we are. And, weve made sure that, as we go through the rest of the year, that what we just said in term of the alignment of the expenses and the revenue come into alignment as they should, and thats, frankly, what were focused on.

Our next question comes from John Janedis with UBS.
 
,:
John Janedis
 
UBS Securities
Hi, thank you.  Hi, guys.  I think the obsession on this call, from a margin perspective, is that you kept the full-year revenue guide intact but lowered the top end of the margin.  And I know, looking a few years back, you saw some margin pressure on digital investments.  So, can you just talk longer term about your confidence level that you dont need further investment that may pressure the future margin opportunities that you referenced at the analyst day?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, and its a fair point.  And, when we say 9.5% to 10%, its a range, okay?  And thats how we look at it.  I wish this business was as predictable, so that we can model  help you with your models  and tell you exactly how everything is going to flow in.  But, it just doesnt work that way.  So we always have to deal with a range.  Thats why we give you 4% to 5% on the revenue side, and when we say at least 9.5%, at least means at least.  It could be more, it could be at least 9.5%.  So its a range, John, and we cant be specific on it.
 
The point is that we have modeled out.  We have new hires built into our modeling, we have staff level expectations from our units, and that all takes into consideration open positions, which include the ramping up, if you will, on the digital side and everything.  But of course, hopefully, well have some new clients that we pick up, which we have to hire against, and it may cause us to ramp up a little bit on the expense side.  But thats a good thing.  What were not going to do is ramp up expenses without matching revenue that it applies to.  I think thats when you have to get concerned.  If were increasing expenses without the expectation, or the fact of, revenue, then were not managing our business correctly.  And, so, if there is any additional hiring, we have a very tight lid on the hiring, there has to be a correlation on the revenue side for us to do those hires.

:
Mr. Janedis
Okay.  And then, look, if we look back to past cycles, oftentimes when we talk about business getting pushed out, it tends to never really fully come back.  So, is the confidence in timing coming because some of that was booked in July, or what is the confidence there?
 
:
Mr. Roth
You know, its both.  We have some timing issues on contracts.  We have some  basically, we know that there are projects out there that have been pushed off from one part of the year to the second half of the year.  So, its a combination of that.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.  Your line is open.
 
:
Benjamin Swinburne,
Morgan Stanley
Hi, good morning, guys.  Its Ben Swinburne.  I wanted to not ask about margins.  I wanted to ask, Frank, about your cash balance and how, generally, we should think about new IPG now that youve got the rating agencies a little bit in a better position, and youre free-cash-flow ramping nicely.  Youve given long-term free cash flow guidance.  Cash moves around quarter to quarter a lot in your business.  But is there a way for us to look at the cash balance and think about where that should normalize to now, looking back at IPG over the last three years when you were carrying well above $2 billion typically?  Im thinking about in the context of return of capital, obviously, and what the potential is there.  So, if you could talk out how youre funding the business, how you think about that stuff, that would be helpful.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Ben, were pleased with the rating agency actions we saw this quarter.  So, investment grade is with two of the three agencies. We hope the third to get there sooner rather than later, which helps in financial flexibility.  We were pleased with the bank deal we did in the quarter, which, again, added financial flexibility.  Weve been relatively aggressive in our share buyback, and right now we are going to execute against that plan.  We expect free cash flow to continue the seasonal patterns that it has.  So from a deployment of that cash, nothing has changed other than the scenario continues to improve.
 
 
16
 
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
Okay.  Is there any relationship between the timing of free cash flow generation during the year and your buyback activity?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
No, we have a regimented program.  I mean, we did  we do look at how our seasonal cash flows work, and thats built into the program that weve got in place currently.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
And, to put it in perspective, we always said we had excess cash on our balance sheet.  And the question has been, what do we do with that excess cash?  The fact that we were upgraded to investment grade freed up  and increased our facility to $1 billion  that freed up our flexibility to return cash to our shareholders.  So it really wasnt specifically tied to any specific cash flow event.  Weve consistently said we had excess cash on our balance sheet.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
Okay, and then, just, Michael, a couple of things that you probably cant comment on but Ill ask anyway since Ive got you on the phone.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Okay.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
Any update on SC. Johnson?  And anything, any comment whatsoever, on Aegis Media now that that business is a little bit smaller than it was before?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes, on Aegis, you know weve always commented that would be an interesting addition to us, but the size of it, and what it would add to us incrementally, at this point, is not exactly high on our radar in terms of use of our cash and our financial flexibility.  And as far as SC Johnson, nothing new has changed since the last time we updated everyone.

Michael Nathanson

Nomura
:
Frank, we heard Omnicom talk about foreign exchange impact to margins.  Could you talk a bit about it if currency stays where it is, or, even this quarter, how much has foreign exchange impacted the year-over-year margin?
 
 
17
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
For this quarter, Michael, it was about 20 basis points negative.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Okay, and for the rest of the year, youre assuming currency stays where it is.  So is that part of your, maybe, the reason of bringing down the range from 9.5% ?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
It was not a large contributor to our thought process.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Okay, so thats one.  Second question would be, weve heard, or weve seen, competitors buy into Brazil, get bigger in Latin America.  I know weve talked about this in the past, but I wonder if weakness in Latin America, or maybe the positioning, makes you think about doing more acquisitions, more digital acquisitions down there.  So, can you claim any of this is, maybe, an offering change, a weakness in offering versus peer groups?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
No, absolutely not.  Weve always targeted Brazil as an area where were going to be adding new  the Cubo and Washington Olivetto transactions were indications of our investments in Brazil, and we have a couple of bolt-ons that were dealing with in Brazil.  So that hasnt changed.  Were continuing to expand in Brazil, invest in Brazil, in both people and agencies that we think are a good fit for us.  And so the fact that there was a decline had to do, as I indicated, with some timing on the revenue side and a particular client that expectations on the spend had changed.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Okay, and then one for both of you guys, just about visibility.  And I just question, when you look at how a company manages earnings, typically the last month of the quarter is when they have the smooth.  So, given the tone of the conversations that youre getting now, I wonder how relevant are the tones about July versus tones in September.  So, if you talk a bit about how your own companies deal with quarterly moves on ad spend, could they cushion their own earnings growth?
 
:
Mr. Roth
The days of smoothing earnings and setting up reserves and so on are  I remember the good old days, if you will  those days are pretty well behind us.  Granted, agencies like to lowball us in terms of the expectations.  The visibility we have into our businesses now, and the reporting, if you will, of the CFOs into Frank, and the meetings we have on a regular basis with our operating units, it doesnt leave a lot of room for surprises in terms of smoothing or anything like that.  And we  part of the tone, and granted, if youre managing a business you like to have some comfort zone, and frankly, the operating meetings that we just had we felt that the businesses were very confident in their numbers.  And frankly, if that were true, they wouldve been less confident in our meetings.  So, that gives us the belief, as we stated, in our ability to meet our objectives.

Wedbush Securities
Good morning, gentlemen.

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, James.
 
:
Mr. Dix
Three questions, I think relatively brief.  First, is your outlook for the second half of the year fairly similar to what it was three months ago?  And, if not, how has it changed?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
You know, actually, the outlook is similar.  Thats when I talk about the tone of the business.  So, it hasnt changed other than everyone is still raising a question of, if theres an implosion in the macroeconomic side of the world, then that would have an impact on our business.  But, absent that, yeah, clients are demanding more for less. Thats not new in our business.  Theyre asking us to show that what were doing is moving the needle.  Thats not new to our business.  They want us to see all the new offerings.  They want to make sure theyre current in terms of the social media, in terms of the digital type of approach to the marketplace, whether theyre spending their dollars in the right place, but thats all normal conversation.
 
The good news is were having those conversations.  If you go back to the recession, we werent having those conversations.  Everyone was at a standstill.  So, Id say the tone supports  in fact, the tone does support what were saying, and if theres a hiccup in the economy, thats what will affect our ability to deliver.
 
:
Mr. Dix
Okay, great.  And I guess, a slight follow-up to that: I think you mentioned in your opening remarks, Michael, that you are seeing some pickup in new business activity.  Is there anything in particular you can highlight for us, where youre in contention to pick up some material business, and would you say that the level of new business activity now is in line with what you would expect for this point in the cycle, or is it maybe still running a little bit below what you might expect?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Id say the pipeline is pretty good.  And,on the new business pitches, theres a number of new pitches out on the media side, which I referred to.  Clearly [ExxonMobil] is a big one thats out there, and McCann is in the finals there.  So were hoping that that one goes our way.  We are in the pitch for BMW.  And, as I indicated, there are a couple of wins at McCann that we cant specifically announce yet.  But, thats encouraging for us.  So Id say all the numbers were talking about, this is a good indication why were comfortable with the forecast.
 
 
19
 
 
:
Mr. Dix
Okay, great.  And then, one last one.  Generally, in terms of the salary increases that you feel you need to remain competitive with peers, are you seeing any more pressure on the salary increases you feel you need to offer, or is it in line with what youve been expecting?
 
:
Mr. Roth
We meet with our HR committee, and we have outside advisers working with us in terms of compensation.  Every once in a while, there is a one-off when youre looking to hire a specific talent.  And, you do have  its competitive in the marketplace, and you have to sweeten the deal.  But overall, our compensation levels are competitive.  Its all factored into the numbers that were referring to.  So if there are sums of money set aside to bring in expertise on the digital side, clearly in the growth areas, thats built into our plan.  And, our managers manage to the margins.  So, if they have to pay more to bring in those types of expertise, they have to justify it on their margin objective.
 
:
Mr. Dix
Im hearing from some peers that they werent seeing any particular pressure, but that they were planning on low single-digit base salary increases .
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes, I know  and, our industry went through the recession, and we held salaries.  We didnt give out increases, and so on.  Thats all already built into the numbers.  Yes, we did build in increases.  We did get back to normal raises and things like that.  But again, its all part of how we manage to the margins.

Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.  Your line is open.
 
Tim Nollen,
Macquarie
:
Hi.  Sorry to come back to this issue about the margins.  And I know we shouldnt necessarily obsess about a single quarter number, but, if I just can double check my understanding, youre saying you expect the growth that youre talking about, and you can manage margins to that  but your margin target I assume, is not assuming that your revenues, if they were to fall below what youre saying, that you could still meet that margin.  Because in that case I guess your severance and expense would go up, and things like that.  So, am I just understanding that right?  Your margin target is dependent on your revenue target?
 
 
20
 
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Well, yeah.  I mean, whether its specifically that target and whether we can make up any small shortfall, yes.  But, absence the revenue goal that were talking about, its hard to deliver on the margins.  We have some tweaking room in between, because there are levers as you point out, like incentive comp, we can take more severance, and so on.  But, we dont have six months left, or less than six months, in the year.  So, its hard to do that.  I think the biggest lever there would be incentive expense.  So, to the extent were short on the profitability, then youll see a drop in our incentive expense commensurate with the miss, if you will.
 
And by the way, thats another indication that were comfortable with our full-year target.  I dont know whether Im allowed to do it this, but Ill do it anyhow: when you look at how you calculate your incentive expense, you assume what your incentive expense is going to be for the full year.  If you notice, for the first half, we havent taken it down.  So, thats another indication that were comfortable that were going to achieve our target.  Otherwise, we would have taken down our incentive expense.  So thats a nuance thats in there.  But thats how the levers work.
 
:
Mr. Nollen
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that there was a little bit of wiggle room.  I assumed that there was, so that helps, thanks.  Can I just ask one other little question, just housekeeping, really.  Your tax rate  30.5%, I think  what should we assume for the last two quarters of the year and ongoing?  I guess it was NOL usage that got you down in Q2, is that right?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler

Hi, good morning, guys.  Ill go a little outlook into the M&A area.  In particular, emerging markets.  Theres been a lot of activity around the group lately of still mostly small things, and I know youve talked a bit about its hard to buy things that are of size in the BRIC and other fast-growing markets.

I know pricings been a challenge, but how are you looking at that as you continue to stabilize and improve the balance sheet?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we have capital to spend. Weve set aside $150 million for acquisition money, and as we went through our operating reviews just recently, at the end of every meeting we ask the groups to see what opportunities they have and where they would like to see them beef up their organizations and bring us transactions.  Weve stepped up our own activity in terms of looking at specific transactions that we think are strategic to our overall plan.  So, were in the market.  Were bringing a couple of small deals that we hope to close in the next month or so, in the emerging markets in particular, and across all different disciplines.  So, we are active out there.  But the pricing on them are very aggressive.
 
And, weve shown  for example, on the digital side, weve grown R/GA, weve grown HUGE, weve grown MRM on a global expansion basis, organically.  And, we feel that thats a more effective way for us to grow those specific expertise, without paying huge premiums to bring them into the fold.  And were doing the same thing with our networks, you know.  So, for example, we just  the Blue Barracuda transaction in Draftfcb in the U.K. is a good example.  Heres a global network.  They saw a great organization with good leadership that theyve been working with, and so we allocated capital, and we did that kind of transaction.  So, were seeing that across the globe and particularly in the emerging markets.
