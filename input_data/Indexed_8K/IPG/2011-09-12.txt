(IPG or the Company) payable on September 23, 2011 to holders of record as of September 9, 2011, (2) the IPG common stock cash dividend paid on June 24, 2011, and (3) the IPG common stock cash dividend paid on March 25, 2011, the number of shares of IPG common stock into which the Companys 5 % Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock) may be converted has been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock.
