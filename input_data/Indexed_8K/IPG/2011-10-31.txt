Summary
 
 
 
 
 
Our strong organic revenue, operating profit and net income growth for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 was driven by a broad cross-section of our portfolio, including all marketing disciplines, domestically and in the major emerging economies, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublics Chairman and CEO.  We saw significant contributions from activity in the digital arena, where all of our agencies are embedding digital expertise at the core of their professional offerings.  We demonstrated effective cost discipline that resulted in high profit conversion and also continued to return capital to our shareholders.  Though macro uncertainty remains, we are confident that our performance for the nine months has positioned us to meet or surpass our targets of 4-5% organic revenue growth and operating margin of 9.5% or better.  This level of performance, combined with the quality of our talent and our strong financial fundamentals, positions us to deliver significant shareholder appreciation for the balance of 2011 and beyond.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
 
Good morning and welcome to the Interpublic Group third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. . . .  I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
 
Thank you.  Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us.
 
We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and will refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We plan to conclude before market open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.

Michael Roth
 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning.  We are pleased to report strong organic revenue growth, operating profit and net income for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011.
 
As you have seen in our release this morning, Q3 organic revenue growth was very strong, at 8.7%.  Operating profit was $173 million, an increase of 73% from a year ago.  Our operating margin was 10.0%, compared to 6.5% a year ago, and diluted earnings per share were $0.40  $0.16 excluding our gain on the Facebook transaction.  The $0.16 of earnings per diluted share compares very favorably to the $0.08 for the same period last year.
 
For the nine months, organic growth was 7.5%, on top of strong growth during the same period a year ago.  Operating profit thus far in 2011 increased 38%.
 
In the third quarter, growth was led by our businesses in the U.S., LatAm, AsiaPac and the U.K.  We had growth in most client sectors.  Digital was a major contributor to our growth.  Our specialist agencies and, just as notably, the digital capabilities within our integrated agencies, marketing services firms and those at our media businesses all contributed to our strong performance.  This performance further validates our digital strategy, which is to ensure that all of our agencies embed digital expertise at the core of their offerings, primarily through investments in talent and tools, as well as targeted acquisitions when necessary.
 
 
 
 
We were pleased to see high-single to low-double-digit organic growth at all our integrated global networks, as well as double-digit growth in marketing services.  We continue to manage our growth carefully and strategically.  High-quality operating talent combined with effective business controls means that top-line growth is accompanied by expense discipline, and therefore converted to operating profit.
 
In the third quarter, we achieved 350 basis points of margin expansion; for the nine months, that number was 130 basis points.  This improvement was achieved by leveraging both of our principal expense lines.  At quarter end, our trailing-twelve-months operating margin was 9.1%, which is the highest for any twelve-month period at IPG in many years.
 
During our prior conference call, we expressed confidence that the pacing of revenue and expenses in 2011 would result in strong margin expansion.  Im sure you will agree that our third quarter results are indicative of that fact.
 
We believe that disciplined investment in our people and our offerings will continue to drive competitive organic revenue growth and improved profitability.  This is a long-standing commitment, one that is backed by the track record of this management team and our operating unit leadership in recent years.
 
Our performance in the nine months has us positioned to deliver on this years financial targets.  We believe that we also remain on track for fully competitive profitability and significant value creation, as outlined at the Investor Day presentation we shared with you back in March.
 
In Q3 we also returned capital to our shareholders at a rate above that contemplated when we initiated our repurchase program in late February.  During the quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares, using $130 million, alongside $27 million in common share dividends.  Through nine months, we have utilized $269 million toward repurchase, buying in 27 million shares.  And as you know, in conjunction with the Facebook transaction in August, our Board raised the total authorization under the repurchase plan to $450 million.
 
Coming into this year, and on our previous conference call, we shared financial performance targets with you of 4%-5% organic revenue growth for the year, and operating margin of 9.5% or better.  Taking into account our strong performance for the nine months, and balancing an appropriate degree of caution due to the current uncertainty in the global economic environment, we feel we can exceed these targets this year, particularly with respect to our revenue growth.

As we move forward into the fourth quarter, the tone of the business remains solid.  We have seen little in the way of pullbacks among clients, despite the economic climate.  The outlook of our project-based businesses is holding firm.  And the performance of the most economically sensitive client sectors  auto, financial services, and retail  remained solid in the third quarter.
 
We all know that the macro economic picture is uncertain, particularly in some markets in Europe.  In addition, we will be cycling against extremely challenging comps, since in the fourth quarter of 2010 we grew 11.2% organically.  Notwithstanding these hurdles, we remain comfortable with our stated performance targets.
 
We are very pleased with the strong quarter and year-to-date, which gives us a real confidence that we can drive strong value creation for the balance of 2011 and beyond.
 
At this point, let me turn things over to Frank.

Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 
On slide 2, youll see an overview which tracks some of the points that Michael just made:
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to slide 3, you see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
 
Turning to operations on slide 4, beginning with revenue:
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the bottom half of this slide, you can see that both of our reported operating segments have contributed to our quarter and nine-month performance.
 
 
 
 
Moving on to slide 5, revenue by region:
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-twelve-month basis, which is 8.6% as of the end of Q3.  This view effectively demonstrates what we have often said about not focusing excessively on any single quarter, but keeping an eye on the broader picture of where weve come from and, more recently, that we have sustained a strong growth trend since coming out of the recession.
 
On slide 7, operating expenses, we continue to be pleased with the operating discipline of our agencies, which continue to move us forward on our annual and longer term margin objectives.
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On slide 8, we show our operating-margin history on a trailing-twelve-month basis, which was 9.1% as of the end of Q3.  This chart clearly shows that we have been very consistent in our improvement, with the understandable exception of the recession in 2009.  It also shows why we are confident that the investments we have made in tools, technology and process improvements to drive greater efficiency will allow us to sustain our margin expansion with growth.
 
On slide 9 we turn to cash flow for the quarter:
 
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 10: we ended the quarter with $1.80 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, compared with $1.94 billion a year ago, a decrease of approximately $140 million.  Including the activity in Q3 that I just reviewed, over the past twelve months we have used a total of approximately $230 million to pay down debt.
 
On slide 11, you see our debt maturity schedule as of September 30th.
 
 
 
In summary, on slide 12, we believe our results speak to the fact that Interpublic is fully competitive.  We are winning in high-growth markets and in the most contemporary digital marketing disciplines, and we are executing to a high standard across our business.  We continue to realize the benefits of a globally diversified business and client base, and we are seeing tangible yield on the investments we have made in tools and talent in recent years.
 
Now, let me turn it back over to Michael.
 
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Thank you, Frank.

In reviewing the quarter and the year to-date, a few additional major headlines stand out.
 
First, our competitiveness is evident in organic growth that is at the top of our peer group, despite facing the toughest comps in our sector.  During the first nine months of this year, all geographic regions posted organic revenue growth, as did all of our major global networks.
 
Another long-term positive for us is the fact that the competitiveness of our offering results from investments that weve been making in talent so that all of our agencies migrate their offerings to incorporate fast-growth digital competencies, as well as the recent acquisitions in digital and geographic growth markets.
 
At Mediabrands, both of our global networks, Initiative and UM, are among the best in terms of contemporary and high-quality media thinking.  The addition of assets such as Orion Trading, ID Media or our Cadreon audience platform, which weve built based on proprietary, data-analytics technology, allows us to deliver customized solutions for a broad range of marketer needs.  The new Lab that is set to launch in New York next week will be a further showcase of the ways Mediabrands works closely with media owners and technology companies to stay on the leading edge and act as true business partners for their clients.
 
At Draftfcb, despite the recent client loss, there is equal resolve to demonstrate that the agencys integrated model is a powerful engine for growth.  Channel-agnostic marketing advice is what our clients need most, especially when its informed by the behavior-based research and analytics tools available at Draftfcb.  The agency has also been able to significantly strengthen its creative leadership.  During the quarter, Draftfcb was once again a strong contributor to top and bottom-line performance for IPG overall.
 
At McCann, there is an appropriate speed and focus in the new management teams transformation efforts.  Recent wins with existing multinationals show that we are moving in the right direction.  Dynamic new leadership is joining us in key markets, such as Brazil, Germany and Japan, as well as at the North American regional level.  The emphasis on collaboration within Worldgroup is also on target, as are our efforts to build an accountability practice that will allow the agency to share in the upside value of the iconic ideas it creates.
 
We continue to see CMG companies take share from the competition, particularly in the PR space.  Weber Shandwick is a dominant player, with terrific depth of management and practice-area leadership.  The agency was recently named one of the four best places to work in social media by the respected Mashable news blog.  And thats among all companies, not just those in our sector.  GolinHarris, Octagon, Jack Morton and FutureBrand are also making great strides, as leaders in their respective disciplines and as part of a larger integrated team.
 
Lowe + Partners solid performance supports the fact that the business has a clear and focused positioning as a creator of populist creative ideas that drive business results, such as the terrific work for Unilever around the world, and the work Deutsch is doing for Volkswagen.  It has an impressive footprint and reputation in the high-growth emerging economies.  And it is developing a strong offering in the area of shopper marketing, while partnering with HUGE for digital capabilities, all of which put it on track to broaden its portfolio of multinational clients, as seen in the recent wins from Microsoft, which have been a result of combining Deutschs U.S. strength with the Lowe worldwide network.
 
 
8
 
As mentioned earlier, our digital specialist agencies are also among the best in the business, and we are seeing strong results from them.  R/GA continues to be the premier name in the space.  Growth at HUGE has been dramatic, and the agency is now expanding internationally.  MRM is another strong performer.  Its worth noting that, while an integral part of the Worldgroup, MRM is also one of the worlds largest global, digital agency networks, with offices in over 30 world markets.
 
Our U.S. independents continue to perform well, because they combine high caliber creativity and content creation capability, deep strategic insights and digital expertise with a full range of communications disciplines, from PR to CRM.  Once again, The Martin Agency, Hill Holliday and Mullen were particular standouts.
 
Our results reflect the fact that we have the right offerings and people to successfully compete in the marketplace.  And while there is economic uncertainty, we have shown that we are capable of effectively controlling expenses and continuing to make margin progress in a range of revenue environments.  We have also indicated to you that we manage to the year end and cautioned against reading too much into any single quarters results.  With respect to 2012, it is too early in our planning cycle to comment on next year, though the macro environment is volatile, and well stay vigilant on costs.
 
The third quarter and first nine months were very strong in terms of increased profitability because we leveraged strong organic growth due to careful expense management.  We continued to invest in growth areas of the businesses, supporting our agencies as they step up the transition to digital and expand further into high-growth emerging markets.  And we also followed through on our commitment to put cash to work through the dividend and share repurchase programs.
 
To summarize, we are well-positioned to meet or surpass our targets of 4-5% organic revenue growth and at least 9.5% operating margin, which is consistent with the longer-term plan for the business that we shared at Investor Day.  This level of performance, combined with targeted strategic M&A activity and return of capital to our owners, will allow us to deliver increased shareholder value.
 
I thank you for your support, and now open the floor for questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator:
 
. . . . our first request is from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. . . .
 
, :
Alexia S. Quadrani
J.P. Morgan
 
Thank you.  Can you just dig in a bit further on the impressive revenue performance in the quarter, specifically in the U.S.?  Where did you really see most of the acceleration in revenue growth in the quarter?  And any further comments you can give us on the performance at McCann?
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
 
One of these things about our agencies - if you couple the independent agencies with our global networks - obviously, as you know, 60% of our overall revenue comes from North America.  Which, in this environment, we think is positive.  We saw strong growth in the retail sector in particular, which was very helpful to us given the performance and the spend in that investment.  The financial services sector, particularly in the United States, led by clients like MasterCard and BofA and, of course, our digital offerings of R/GA and HUGE were significant in the U.S. growth.  So you couple all of those together, I think, continues to show that our footprint in the United States, coupled with our overall global footprint, is whats driving these strong results.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
 
And understanding you have a more difficult comp in the Q4 that you mentioned, but does it feel like this relative, this acceleration youre seeing, continues into October?  And then  Michael, you know I had to ask that  and then on the severance number, does that include SC Johnson in the quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yes, the severance number does include SC Johnson.  1.1% is a little bit higher than the numbers  we usually tell you to use around 1%.  But I think, given the environment were in and some of the performance in some of our European agencies, I think a little north of 1% is a good number to use for the severance numbers going forward.  Fourth quarter, we continue to say, Alexia  and I loved your headline in your note; I thank you  is weve got to look at this on a full-year basis, which is why were saying we keep looking at 4% to 5%.  Probably we should be able to do better than that and a 9.5% or better margin.  Fourth quarter has strong headwinds and, obviously, if we continue to perform the way we are, were hopeful to see a good performance in the fourth quarter, but its just very difficult for us to go quarter-to-quarter.
 
But the tone is very solid, and the key there, of course, is our project business, and we havent seen any pullback in the project business.  And if you recall, 2008, we really didnt see that pullback until the end of November and December.  So  and youve heard me say this  this doesnt feel like 2008.  Our clients have a fair amount of cash on their balance sheets.  They have access to the capital markets, and we dont get a sense of any big pullback in the fourth quarter.  So all of that leads to the conclusions weve stated in terms of our goals for the full year.

Ms. Quadrani
 
Okay.  Thank you very much

John Janedis
 
UBS Securities
 
Thanks, good morning.

Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Good morning, John.
 
:
Mr. Janedis
 
Guys, if we look back over the last ten years or so, I dont think youve ever had a period where the second and third quarter operating margins were equal to each other.  And I know the driver, Frank, was the base and benefits line, but can you dig a little bit more in terms of specificity on that line item?  And if there were no shifts of costs, should we expect 2Q and 3Q margins to be close to equal going forward?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
John, Im not sure I can even comment on the go-forward of Q2 and Q3, but I think it is worth calling out again, as we did in the last call, the sequential build-up of costs in 2010 was dramatic given the phasing of revenue growth coming out of the recession.  So what you saw was, as growth came back in the equation in the second quarter of 2010, we couldnt hire quick enough and we had to quote  we had to somewhat catch up in the back half of the year.  For 2011, right now, the growth is at a more sustained pace and, as we said in the second quarter call, you should expect that H2 cost increases should not be as dramatic as they were in the prior year, and I think that was evident in the third quarter.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
You know, I think its a legitimate question to ask that, as weve seen this growth, do we have to hire a significant amount of people to support that?  And consistent with what Frank just said, again, we manage to the full year, and so we dont see a big ramp-up in our costs in the fourth quarter, which would give people concern, and I think thats the discipline that weve shown weve been able to continually show  in our performance.
 
:
Mr. Janedis
 
Thanks for the color there.  And, just quickly, can you remind us how much project business added to your organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
I dont know, definitionally, John, what we could describe as a project.  I mean, we saw and, as Michael pointed out, we dont see this as 2008 all over again, but things that you would have considered not-project business in 2008 dried up pretty quickly.  So theres a fair amount of variability against all of the fourth quarter revenue and, to Michaels point, right now operators are still feeling pretty good about how business feels going into the last three months.
 
 
11
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, but, I mean, dont think of our project business as providing the majority of our revenue in the fourth quarter, okay?  We still have our regular  the rest of our businesses to perform.
 
:
Mr. Janedis
 
Of course.  Thank you.

Youre welcome.

Good morning.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
 
Just a couple of questions.  One clarification, Michael and Frank.  Is all of the severance related to the SC Johnson account loss already accrued?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
Theres some amount that youre going to see, Ben, in the fourth quarter.  But the majority of it was dealt with in the third quarter.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
 
Okay, terrific.  And then, any comment on the buyback pace?  Or maybe a better way to ask the question is, are there things in the third versus the fourth quarter that we should be keeping in mind around cash flow and, obviously, of the Facebook proceeds this quarter, that factor into how you guys think about the buyback that we should just keep in mind?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
One of the questions that always comes up is, during this past quarter weve seen a depressed stock price which, if this was a pure opportunistic buyback, when we were below $8 a share or even below, we would have taken all our cash and bought in our shares.  I understand that some people are of that view.  We view the share buyback program as a program.  And that is, over a period of time, to return cash to our shareholders in a very thoughtful way.  That said, you can see weve accelerated our share buyback program and use of it, (a), by the Facebook shares, but the other authorization that we had prior to the Facebook transaction, and that was an indication that we did believe that our shares were oversold, and there was an opportunity for us to buy in shares at what we viewed as an attractive price.  But were not going to use our share buyback program as a vehicle to pick the right stock price for us to buy in our shares.  So I think the tone of us accelerating at the rate we did puts us on track to complete the share buyback program before it was originally contemplated when we instituted the plan.  But again, its not going to cause us to accelerate in a dramatic pace if the share price declines.

Mr. Swinburne
 
Got you.  I dont think youll have that problem today.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
I dont think so either.  I hope not.  Thank you.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
 
And then, just lastly, last quarter we were all freaking out about revenue being pushed out into the rest of the year.  I didnt know, I think you guys had called out Latin America, maybe specifically Brazil.  Is that part of the acceleration in that region this quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Well, I think what we said was, some of it was timing, and I think what youve seen is the recovery in Brazil is exactly that.  We saw the timing give rise in the third quarter.  Again, it goes to the issue of we cant particularly call out exactly what quarter a lot of this revenue is going to fall in.  But aside from the timing of that particular event, weve seen a very strong business environment in Brazil, and its reflected in the double-digit growth that youve seen.

David Bank
RBC Capital Markets
 
Thank you very much, good morning.
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.
 
:
Mr. Bank
 
Two questions.  The first is, we have seen a lot of headlines, some high-profile headlines in the first half of the year, on some of the losses that occurred.  But those, in theory, did open up some opportunities as you are conflicted pretty heavily by some of them.  Can you update us on how you see new business coming together?  Is there a timeframe?  Is there any color you can give us on how youre filling the hole, in a sense, looking into 2012?
 
 
13
 
 And the second question is a little bit of a follow-up on the last one, which is, if you look at what drove the outperformance, can you talk about how much of it was about, maybe, stuff that was within your control, like increased scope of business, more business earned, as opposed to the actual client spend, stuff that you dont so much control but certainly benefited from?  Thanks.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, let me talk about headwinds.  It seems to be, unfortunately  Ive always articulated that first of all, our strongest growth comes from our existing clients, okay?  And I think the positive results that youre seeing is consistent with that because its hard to cycle through the client losses that we are cycling through both in 2011 and the cycling that we have headwinds in going into 2012.  And our biggest mantra here is, keep our existing clients happy and continue to grow within those clients, and, fortunately, thats what weve been able to do.  So a good portion of our growth is coming from our existing client base.  And coming into 2011, we had some difficult headwinds that we were able to overcome.  And yes, we have some client losses that we have to cycle through in 2012, and thats a headwind.  But our business units, in particular the ones who were, like Draftfcb, which has to cycle through that client loss, theyre very focused on replacing that business.  Its not going to happen overnight, but they have a game plan.  Theyve been working on it.  Youre right, absolutely, that it opened up a category for them which previously they couldnt approach because of the exclusivity.
 
But, more importantly, that category has opened up for all of our global brands.  And that category has some of the great multinational companies on a global footprint, and were already working those clients to see how we pick up revenue from that sector, if you will.  So I think itll take some time, but Im confident that well be able to overtake those headwinds, particularly at Draftfcb and the rest of our global clients and networks.
 
On the question of timing and things like that, in the good old days you could address timing and smoothing on revenue and expenses from the accounting point of view, and shame on us for missing by $26 million.  Ill have to reiterate: it was only $26 million in the second quarter.  But it goes to show you that we really dont have that type of control, and we dont control the scope of work.  And the fact is, we have a scope of work that we work against and the timing of that  we dont all of a sudden run out and have all of our people complete everything at the end of the third quarter so that we can meet target.  So what youre really asking is, do we move a lot of our business from the fourth quarter into the third quarter to make sure we have this 
 
:
Mr. Bank
 
No, Mike, Im really not.  That really wasnt the question.
 
 
14
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Okay.
 
:
Mr. Bank
 
The question was more about, is it about client spend thats somewhat unpredictable and maybe came in stronger, or is it that are you increasing your scope of business with clients?  Are there  are you winning more wallet share out of your clients?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yes, absolutely.  And thats my point about if you take our top 20 clients, we see good organic growth from them.  And the answer to that, that has historically been a key portion of our organic growth.  And, yes, the wallet share and the area scope.  Project business by definition is one-offs, and it goes on top of our normal revenue stream.  And thats why when we say project business is strong, thats good for us.  And the way we get more money from our existing clients is exactly the key to our success, and that is we bring more of our expertise, we bring more of the integrated offering to the table, and hopefully we bring in some of our other disciplines throughout IPG into our existing clients.  Thats how our model is supposed to work.

. . . our next request is from Bill Bird of Lazard. . . .
 
, :
William Bird
Lazard Capital Markets
 
I was wondering if you could just talk about your relative appetite for larger acquisitions, like billion-dollar-plus acquisitions.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
We constantly look at a lot of these transactions that are out there, particularly in the digital space.  We see the prices that are being asked, and its a time for us to reiterate our strategy on digital.  We dont believe we had to go out and buy huge digital offerings.  We have premier  R/GA is growing dramatically on a global basis.  What we did with HUGE is a great example of our strategy and, that is, we bought a great company headquartered in Brooklyn and couple it with the Lowe footprint and the rest of IPG and their own expertise, theyre growing on a global basis, and were very competitive on a digital basis.  And we pick up strategic digital transactions as you saw we did in the third quarter.  So we dont see any need for us to spend huge amounts of money to add to our digital portfolio.
 
If we were losing in the digital environment, whether it be our specialist digital agencies or our global networks like McCann, Draftfcb or Lowe, and if we were losing  obviously with the Worldgroup having MRM and I already referenced them in terms of being one of the largest global digital agencies  theres no need for us to go out and spend that kind of money to bring in the expertise because we already have the expertise within the umbrella.
 
 
15
 
On the media side, which is a subtle way of your question, sure, there are markets where we would like to have a little bigger scale.  But theres no need for us to go out and spend $1 billion for us to capture those markets.  So were going to grow those markets organically.  Were going to add to our talent pool.  If we see strategic acquisitions in those markets, theyll fit in within our global objective.  Weve been spending about $150 million a year on acquisitions, and theres no reason for us to ramp that up to $1 billion dollars.  Its only if we were missing an expertise would we spend that kind of money right now.
 
:
Mr. Bird
 
Thanks.  And on the buyback program, is it your intention to have buybacks mirror cash flow as you figure out how to deploy intra-year?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Clearly, cash flow is a factor that goes into buybacks.  Remember, we had built up an excess cash position on our balance sheet as we were going through our turnaround period and, given the confidence level that management and the board has in our business offerings and the future of IPG, that certainly added to the fact that we implemented a dividend as well as the share buyback program.  But you have to keep sight of your cash flow before you go out and continue, particularly the share buyback.  The dividend, we believe  you dont institute a dividend if youre not highly confident that it will continue out into the out years.  So we will be very conscious of our cash flows, which continue to support the buyback program and the dividend that you see.
 
:
Mr. Bird
 
And I may have missed it in your last response, and I apologize, but on new business, just wondering how new business opportunities look right now.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Actually, there are announced global pitches that are out there.  McCann Worldgroup is in the finals of the Exxon pitch.  General Motors had some big media as well as a pitch going on right now which were participating in.  But absent those, we dont see any big global pitches.  But on the other side, we are winning business.  I always comment about this.  Whenever we lose business, its always out in the papers.  When we win business from multinational clients, they like to keep it quiet.  So it just so happens when we win business, we cant announce it.  When we lose business, its all over the papers.  So weve had some good client wins already, which are adding to our growth numbers, and were very pleased with it.  Id rather win the business and not announce it than not have it.

Revisiting some of the Investor Day commentary, I think, Frank, that you gave  and thinking about 2012, I understand its visibility is poor; its cloudy;  youre in the middle of discussions with clients about projected scope of work, etc.  But in your longer-term ramp towards competitive level margins, you kind of laid out a 30% incremental margin target or metrics, if you will.  And just thinking about 2012 and organic growth, I would say the Streets probably looking at anywhere from 1% to 4%, somewhere in there.  What do you need on organic growth to get to that kind of incremental margin and, in a bear-case scenario, if the clouds darken and build a little bit more here and were looking at a poor year for 2012, can you still build margin?  Can you still step forward?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
On the Investor Day discussion, Peter, we used the growth rate of 4% to 5%, and we thought a 30% conversion rate on that was reasonable and we still think that based on where we are today.  If we see growth pulled back a bit and smaller, can we still have margin improvement?  I think we can, yes. Weve got a number of initiatives around the company with respect to investment against tools and technology and back office consolidation and shared service.  So theres a whole bunch of other things going on to drive operating efficiency, and I think were already seeing some of the benefits of that in our cost controls this year.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
If we enter a period as we did  and, I dont believe we are of 2009  its obviously difficult to expand margin in that environment.  But on a flat-to-slightly-positive organic growth for 12, we should be able to expand margin.  It just wont be expanding at the rate that weve expanded it, obviously, in 2011.  But I think flat-to-positive, we should be able to expand margin.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
 
Great.  And a quick revisit to a prior question on the new business versus organic growth from existing clients.  I guess, just to rephrase, did you see anything in this quarter which disproportionately changed the contribution of those two buckets, or was it a normal, we have new business money come in and we have growth from existing clients?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, I think its a combination of that.  And, frankly, the strength of our digital offerings is very powerful, and if you take MRM, you take HUGE, and you take R/GA, those three offerings are growing at very attractive rates.  And the fact that theyre global, I think, is adding to those results and, frankly, which is why it adds to our comfort level on the growth going into the out years.

. . . our next request now from Tim Nollen, Macquarie. . . .
 
Tim Nollen,
Macquarie
:
 
Hi, thanks.  My questions have basically been answered, just two quick touch-ups, please.  My understanding coming into Q3 was you were still cycling against some cost build-up from last year.  I just want to clarify that that is more or less out of the system now, on a relative basis, when you started rebuilding costs last year.  And then, secondly, again on new business, obviously theres at least one very high-profile loss.  I dont know if you care to give a figure or trend on net new business in the quarter, but maybe another way to ask it would be is, would net new account wins in Q3 contribute to ongoing growth or, perhaps, withdraw from that?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, Ill let Frank answer the question on the costs.  But were still net new business negative, and we still have headwinds going into 2012.  But there were obviously wins to offset the headwinds we had on those clients coming into the third quarter, and some of it were client-specific.  So if we had a headwind, for example, on Microsoft, which we did, the fact that Deutsch won business from Microsoft in terms of their Windows and their B2B business, that obviously offset some of the headwinds.  So thats the kind of stuff that were talking about.  The one client at Draftfcb, that is discrete and thats a headwind going into [2012], and were starting to build up revenue against that loss.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Tim, on the cost side, what we said was, we dont expect to see the second half costs accelerate compared to the first half pace  the same pace we saw 2010.  But lets remember that you have sequential revenue growth Q3 to Q4 that will require some incremental costs, but we dont expect that cost to be at the same pace that we saw growth in the prior year.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, let me clarify one other point.  For example, on General Motors, MRM continues to win digital business and scope on its projects with General Motors.  So on an IPG basis, we had a headwind from the loss of Chevy at Campbell Ewald, and yet MRM is growing General Motors.  So that accounts for, obviously, a good part of the makeup on that particular client.
 
 
18
 
:
Mr. Nollen
 
Okay.  So after the losses that we all know about, the trend in replacing that is positive.  Correct?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, its flat to positive, but obviously our goal is to turn positive.
 
:
Mr. Nollen
 
Yeah, no, very clear, that makes sense.  Thanks.

Ill refrain from congratulating you on the quarter.  Ill let the investors do that today.  I think they will.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
We could use the congratulations here and there, James.
 
:
Mr. Dix
 
Two things, one on growth, which you guys have discussed a little bit before for 2012.  Youve talked as of third quarter that youre showing that your competitive levels in terms of your offering and ability to win in the market  that seems a little bit modest given todays results  but obviously, you also have some headwinds which youve also talked about, some client losses.  So, looking forward, is it best for us, in terms of modeling, to think about whatever our industry growth assumption is and make some haircut to it for you, just given known headwinds, or do you think maybe youre still positioned to grow in line with the industry, whatever thats going to be next year?
 
And then second, just in terms of margins, now that it looks like 2011 seems to be more in hand in terms of hitting your targets, just thinking about the longer-term progression towards that 13% that you laid out in the Investor Day, if you could refresh or update in any way where you expect the bulk of that leverage to come from, roughly what proportions from leverage against salaries and then versus other things.  Thanks.
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Yeah, Ill handle the headwinds issue; Ill let Frank talk about the margins.  I think he already said we expect to convert the revenue at a 30% conversion, and thats how we get to the 2013 target using the growth assumptions of 4% to 5%.  If I was modeling on a very conservative basis, I think your approach to industry norm minus headwinds would be a very conservative way to look at our numbers.  That said, I do believe that were very focused.  Weve opened up a category here as a result of one of the big losses.  Weve had new business wins, and weve had successes in growing organically.  So obviously, we wouldnt view that as a good performance, okay.  And certainly when we outline our budgets and our goals for the year, I wouldnt view that as a way  we wouldnt walk away being satisfied with that performance.
 
 
19
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
James, on the margin progression, I think given where we are through nine months, we still believe that the bridge we built you for Investor Day is still very accurate.  Theres some growth component to it, and I think most of the leverages have come out of base salaries.
 
:
Mr. Dix
 
Okay.  So basically that slide in your presentation still pretty much still holds.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
 
Its still good.
 
:
Mr. Dix
 
Okay, all right.  Thanks very much.

Yes, good morning.  Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering if youd give us a little better breakdown by industry group how you guys did here.  Im particularly curious in the quarter how auto did.  And what were some of your weaker categories?  Thank you.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, auto is where we were clearly cycling through the loss at Campbell Ewald.  It was still positive, but it wasnt at the double-digit growth that we saw in the second quarter.  That said, we do have some wins, particularly, as I outlined, at MRM, and the spend at some of our existing other auto clients.  So it was in the low-single digits in terms of auto.  Retail was particularly strong for us, as I said before, that being up well into the double digits.  Financial services is the same thing.  Health and personal care was high-single digits for us, as was food and beverage.
 
:
Mr. Huber
 
What categories were weak in the quarter?
 
 
20
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Packaged goods was a little bit soft, and that reflected us transitioning through a particular client, as you know, and tech and telecom, which is a big sector for us, was in the low-single digits, and there we had a couple of small clients that were still cycling through.  But our big tech and telecom clients provided some growth to us.
 
:
Mr. Huber
 
What is your general sense for 2012, the categories that you perhaps are most concerned about as you look out to the 12-month period?  Is it these same categories that were weak in the third quarter, or are they . . .?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
I think packaged goods is always the one that you get concerned about.  I think historically on a full-year basis, we see slow growth, but its consistent.  So I think thats a reasonable assumption for packaged goods going forward.
 
Everyones always concerned about the auto sector given the cyclicality of that, and if were entering into a double dip, is there going to be a pull back there.  We havent seen any indications of that, and I think our offerings in the auto sector continue to be very strong.  Remember, in addition to General Motors, we do Volkswagen, Hyundai and Chrysler.  So those are  we have offset  Subaru if you will  so we have offsets to one particular company, and I think that bodes well for us.  And I think, again, in a difficult environment, financial services and retail always are a question, but so far weve been very pleased with the spend in those markets.
 
:
Mr. Huber
 
And is your thought on auto in the fourth quarter, do you expect it to do better than you saw in the third quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
 
Well, we continue to see a solid spend there, and I cant comment, yet, with the fourth quarter still ongoing.
