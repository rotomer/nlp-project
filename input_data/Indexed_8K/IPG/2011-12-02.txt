As a result of the cumulative effect of (1) the cash dividend on common stock declared by the Board of Directors of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG or the Company) payable on December 15, 2011 to holders of record as of December 1, 2011, and (2) the common stock cash dividend paid on September 23, 2011, the number of shares of IPG common stock into which certain of the Companys convertible securities may be converted has been adjusted in accordance with their terms.
 
The applicable conversion rates for IPGs 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.25% Notes) and 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.75% Notes) have been adjusted as follows:
 
 
The conversion rate with respect to the 4.25% Notes and the 4.75% Notes is the number of IPG common shares into which each $1,000 principal amount of notes may be converted, which as adjusted represents a conversion price of approximately $12.13 per conversion share.
 
The conversion rate with respect to the Companys 5/% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock has not been adjusted since September 2011 because the applicable threshold before further adjustment is required has not been reached.
