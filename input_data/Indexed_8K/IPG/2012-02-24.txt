NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN, pursuant to Article 11 of the indenture dated as of November 15, 2006 (the Base Indenture) and Section 2.02 of the first supplemental indenture dated as of November 15, 2006 (the Supplemental Indenture, and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture) between The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the Company), The Bank of New York Mellon as trustee (the Trustee) and the 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Notes), that the Company will redeem all of the outstanding Notes on March 26, 2012 (the Redemption Date) at a price (the Redemption Price) equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.  We expect the interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date, March 15, 2012, up to, but excluding, March 26, 2012.  Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into shares of Interpublic common stock at a conversion rate of 82.4612 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes until the close of business on March 23, 2012 by complying with the procedures in paragraph 9 of the Notes.

The principal amount of the Notes outstanding is $400,000,000.
 
On the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price will become due and payable. Interest on the Notes will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Redemption Price, the only remaining right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon presentation and surrender to the Trustee, as Paying Agent for the Notes.  Payment of the Redemption Price plus accrued interest will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Notes by mail or hand delivery to:
 
 
 
 
NOTICE:  The Trustee will withhold under the United States backup withholding rules 28% of any payment that is made upon redemption of a Note unless the holder, when presenting the Notes, delivers a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption from such backup withholding.
 
The Paying Agent will also act as Conversion Agent for the Notes.
