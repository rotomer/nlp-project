Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 2, 2012, the Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company, rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and equally in right of payment with all other unsecured senior indebtedness of the Company. The Notes mature on March 15, 2022, and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.00%, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2012.
The Notes are not entitled to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments. At any time or from time to time, the Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, as a whole or in part, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice to holders at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on such Notes discounted to the date of redemption at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable rate on U.S. Treasury securities specified in the Supplemental Indenture, plus 35 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (defined and described more fully in the Supplemental Indenture to mean certain changes in control of the Company that result in negative rating repercussions), the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase their Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes.
In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or certain of its majority-owned subsidiaries, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately. If any other event of default specified in the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of all Notes immediately due and payable.
The Indenture contains certain limitations on the ability of the Company and certain majority-owned subsidiaries to grant liens without equally securing the Notes, or to enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and limitations, as further described in the Base Indenture.
The foregoing description of the Notes, Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents.

(a) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein relating thereto;
(b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;

SECTION 1.03. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee. In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
Any certificate or opinion of an Officer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such Officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an Officer or Officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
Any certificate, statement or opinion of an Officer of the Company or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Company, unless such Officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion is based are erroneous.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
SECTION 1.04. Acts of Holders. (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 5.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
"Act"
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual
 
capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(e) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so, that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the immediately following paragraph. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
provided
provided
(f) The Trustee shall set a record date, which shall not be more than 15 days prior to the date of commencement of solicitation of such action contemplated by this Section 1.04(f), for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 4.02, (iii) any direction referred to in Section 4.12, (iv) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 4.07(2), or (v) any waiver of past defaults pursuant to Section 4.13, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If such a record date is fixed pursuant to this paragraph, the relevant action may be taken or given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be holders of Securities of a series for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of such series have authorized or agreed or consented to such action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be computed as of such record date; that no such action by Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall
provided
 
be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date and the proposed action by Holders to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.06.
SECTION 1.05. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
(a) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and delivered or sent to the Trustee, Attn: Global Corporate Trust Services by (ii) facsimile at 404-898-2467 followed by telephonic confirmation at 404-898-8832 or (iii) first-class mail at the address below or any other address previously furnished in writing to the Company by the Trustee:
(b) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and delivered or sent to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Attn: Treasurer, Secretary (i) facsimile at 212-704-2229 followed by telephonic confirmation at (212) 704-1220 or (ii) first-class mail at the address below or any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company:
(c) In respect of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to verify or confirm that the Person sending instructions, directions, reports, notices or other communications or information by electronic transmission is, in fact, a Person authorized to give such instructions, directions, reports, notices or other communications or information on behalf of the party purporting to send such electronic transmission; and the Trustee shall not have any liability for any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or sustained by any party as a result of such reliance upon or compliance with such instructions, directions, reports, notices or other communications or information; provided such losses, liabilities, costs or expenses have not arisen from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee. Each other party agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of electronic methods to submit instructions, directions, reports, notices or other communications or information to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, notices, reports or other communications or information, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties.
 
SECTION 1.06. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Indenture or any Security provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be deemed sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein or in such Security expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders or the validity of the proceedings to which such notice relates.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
Where this Indenture or any Security provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
SECTION 1.07. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required to be included or deemed included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, such provision of the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or shall be excluded, as the case may be.
SECTION 1.08. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
SECTION 1.09. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
SECTION 1.10. Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
SECTION 1.11. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
 
SECTION 1.12. Governing Law. This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws (other than the choice of law provisions) of the State of New York.
SECTION 1.13. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities other than a provision in the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day or on such other day as may be set out in the Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01 at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, if payment is made on such next succeeding Business Day or other day set out in such Officers' Certificate.
provided
SECTION 1.14. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder, by accepting a Security, waives and releases all such liability. Such waivers and releases are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities.
SECTION 1.15. Judgment Currency. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of, or premium or interest, if any, on the Securities of any series (the ) into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the ), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in the City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding that on which a final unappealable judgment is given and (b) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (a)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture. For purposes of the foregoing, means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in the City of New York or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation, or executive order to close.

SECTION 1.16. Counterparts. This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Each of the Company and the Trustee hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the Securities or the transactions contemplated hereby.

All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided (i) by a Board Resolution, and (subject to Section 2.04) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officers' Certificate or (ii) in any such indenture supplemental hereto.

SECTION 2.03. Denominations. The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.01. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000.
SECTION 2.04. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or any Vice President of the Corporation under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and make such Securities available for delivery. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 2.02, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Sections 315(a) through (d) of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(a) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.02, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(b) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution or in a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.01, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(c) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.01 and of the immediately preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution and the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, or in the written opinion of counsel to the Trustee (which counsel may be an employee of the Trustee) such authentication may not lawfully be made or could involve the Trustee in personal liability.
If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Company Order with respect to the authentication and delivery of such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities of such series in global form that (i) shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by such Security or Securities in global form, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Security or Securities in global form or its nominee, and (iii) shall be made available for delivery by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction.
Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 2.01 for a Security in global form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if the Depositary is so registered. Each Depositary shall enter into an agreement with the Trustee and the Company governing the respective duties and rights of such Depositary, the Company and the Trustee with regard to Securities issued in global form.
Unless otherwise provided for in the form of Security, each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefits under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.10 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 2.05. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, temporary Securities of such series which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing all or a portion of the Outstanding Securities of such series.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
SECTION 2.06. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with Section 9.02 in a Place of Payment a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the ) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of registration of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
"Security Register"
"Security Registrar"
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Security in global form) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Each Security issued in global form authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such series or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Security issued in global form shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in certificated form in the circumstances described below, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.04, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor in certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities of such series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
The Company may at any time in its sole discretion determine that Securities issued in global form shall no longer be represented by such a Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series of like tenor in certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities of such series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series may surrender a Security in global form of such series
 
in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in certificated form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
(i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new certified Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Security in global form; and
(ii) to such Depositary a new Security in global form of like tenor in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of certificated Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in certificated form, such Security in global form shall be canceled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
Unless otherwise provided in the Securities to be transferred or exchanged, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.05, 8.06 or 10.07 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of such series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 10.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
The foregoing provisions relating to registration, transfer and exchange may be modified, supplemented or superseded with respect to any series of Securities by a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto.
SECTION 2.07. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 2.08. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called ) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
"Defaulted Interest"
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment (which shall be not less than 25 days after the receipt by the Trustee of such notice, unless such Trustee shall consent to an earlier date), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause (2), such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Security in global form, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Security in global form or impair, as between such Depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such Security in global form, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the right of such Depositary (or its nominee) as holder of such Security in global form.
SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it.

SECTION 2.11. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 2.12. CUSIP Number.

The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP number of any series of Securities.

Events of Default in respect of the Notes are set forth in Section 4.01 of the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by Article 4 of the Supplemental Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, conditions and exceptions, Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power, including the annulment of a declaration of acceleration. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clauses (1) and (2) of Section 4.01 of the Base Indenture) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
15. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, AND SALE OF ASSETS
In the event of a consolidation, merger, or sale of assets to convey, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets as described in Section 7.01 of the Base Indenture, the successor corporation to the Company shall succeed to and be
substituted for the Company, and may exercise the Company's rights and powers under the Indenture, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the Company shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the Notes with respect to its obligations under the Indenture.
16. TRUSTEE AND AGENT DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY
The Trustee, Paying Agent and Security Registrar under the Indenture, each in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent or Security Registrar.
17. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS
A director, officer or employee, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any stockholder as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
18. AUTHENTICATION
This Note shall not be valid until an authorized officer of the Trustee or Authenticating Agent manually signs the Trustee's certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

New York, NY 10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with its offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-179667) and the prospectus dated February 24, 2012, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated February 28, 2012 (together the "Prospectus") of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Securities"). The Securities were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 2, 2012 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated March 2, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee.
In arriving at the opinion expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
(a) the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
(b) the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein; and
(c) executed copies of the Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture, including the forms of the global certificates representing the Securities.
 
 
The Interpublic Group of Companies, p. 2
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that the Securities have been validly issued by the Company and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the federal law of the United States of America or the law of the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinion is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
We express no opinion as to the enforceability of Section 1.15 of the Indenture relating to currency indemnity.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
We hereby consent to the use of our name in the Prospectus, under the heading "Legal Matters," as counsel for the Company who has passed on the validity of the Securities and to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 2, 2012. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder. The opinion expressed
 
The Interpublic Group of Companies, p. 3
 
herein is rendered on and as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinion expressed herein.
