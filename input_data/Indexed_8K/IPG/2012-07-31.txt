Summary
 
 
 
Our organic revenue growth, which was 0.8% in the second quarter and 1.7% in the first half, reflects strength in high-growth international markets, digital and marketing services, as well as revenue headwinds that wed previously indentified. Once again, we demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the business so as to improve profitability, despite these headwinds, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic Chairman and CEO.  The global economic situation remains uncertain, which will require vigilance as we move through the balance of the year. We are nonetheless targeting stronger growth in the second half, in order to achieve our full year 2012 objective of 3% organic revenue growth. With respect to operating margin, our objective remains to deliver 50 basis points or better of improvement this year. We also remain committed to investing in growth drivers for our business, returning capital to our owners and further enhancing shareholder value.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Interpublic Group second quarter and first half 2012 earnings conference call. . . .  I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Thank you as well for your patience this morning as the release was behind schedule due to problems at our service provider.
 
We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and will refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We plan to conclude before market open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.
 
 
:
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us for our review of our second quarter and first half 2012 results.
 
As usual, Ill start out by covering the key highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details on our results, and Ill conclude with an update on our agencies and outlook, to be followed by Q&A.
 
To begin with the highlights, we are pleased to report Q2 diluted earnings per share growth of 16%, along with operating margin expansion that supports our target for the year.  Our organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 0.8%, and 1.7% for the first half of the year.
 
In the U.S., our organic revenue decrease in Q2 was 3.2%.  The approximate 5% impact of last years account losses more than offset sound U.S. performance.  We had growth at several of our integrated agencies and across the CMG portfolio.  Our digital services continue to make strong contributions  that includes both the capabilities weve built within our agencies and of course our digital specialty agencies.
 
 
 
 
Internationally, organic growth in the second quarter was 6%.  In the AsiaPac and LatAm regions, double-digit growth was due to the strength of all our global networks, media business, digital capabilities and our marketing services specialists.
 
In the U.K., we again had solid growth in Q2, while in Continental Europe, organic revenue decreased moderately due to continued macro challenges.
 
Turning to the client sectors, we had growth during the quarter in auto & transportation, financial services and food & beverage.  As expected, we had decreases in the tech & telecom and consumer goods categories.  Its worth noting that, absent the loss of SC Johnson, the consumer goods category showed good growth, a sign that our U.S. business is solid.
 
In health care we continued to see industry-wide softness, due to patent expirations and regulatory uncertainty.  Retail sector revenues in the quarter decreased, due to some pullback from existing clients.  These trends weighed particularly heavily on our U.S. revenue in the quarter.
 
For the year to date, we are net new business positive.  Ill cover specific wins when I provide detail on the agencies in my closing remarks, but weve seen good results thus far this year in major pitches, such as Bank of America, Unilever, as well as good growth with current clients, like Microsoft and General Motors.
 
While first half revenue growth is below our full-year objective, we are targeting a stronger second half and our full-year objective continues to be 3% organic growth.
 
Moving to operating expenses and margin, our results continue to reflect careful and effective cost management, along with disciplined investment in the growth areas of our business, through talent acquisition and development as well as targeted M&A activity.
 
Q2 operating margin increased 30 basis points, to 10.3%.  For the first half of 2012, our operating margin was also up 30 basis points compared to a year ago.  On a trailing-twelve-month basis, our operating margin increased to 9.9%, which is once again the highest level of 12-month profitability that IPG has posted in over a decade.  We are well positioned to deliver on our 2012 objective of 50 basis points or more of margin improvement.
 
Q2 diluted earnings per share were $0.22, an improvement of 16% from a year ago.  Dilutive shares decreased 13%, as a result of our share repurchase program and the elimination of the convertible notes retired earlier this year.
 
We continued to place a priority on returning capital to shareholders in the quarter.  During the second quarter, we repurchased another six million shares, bringing our first-half total to 11 million shares.  Along with our quarterly common stock dividend, we returned over $170 million to shareholders in the first half of 2012. Given the seasonality of our cash flows, we are planning to increase our share repurchase activity in the second half of 2012.

With that as an overview, Ill turn things over to Frank, who will take us through our financial performance.
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 
On slide 2, youll see an overview of our results:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to slide 3, you see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.  Its worth noting a couple items:
 
 
 
Turning to operations on slide 4, beginning with revenue:
 
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
 
As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, the organic revenue change at our Integrated Agency Networks, IAN, segment was negative 0.5% for the quarter.  This is where the revenue headwinds from prior-year account losses are.  First-half organic growth was 0.5%.
 
Organic growth at our CMG segment was a strong 8.0%.  We had solid performance across our marketing services portfolio and strong growth in nearly every region of the world.  First half organic growth was 8.3%.
 
Moving to slide 5, revenue by region:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-twelve-month basis.  The most recent data point is 3.7%, which is updated to include Q2 2012.
 
Moving on to slide 7 and our operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
 
On slide 8, we show our operating margin improvement on a trailing-twelve-month basis, with the most recent data point of 9.9% for Q2 2012.  As we have said previously, our target level for 2012 is to improve at least 50 basis points, with our objective of fully competitive profitability by 2014.
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet, on slide 9:
 
 
 
 
 
 
On slide 10 we turn to the cash flow for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
6
 
 
On slide 11, you see our total debt outstanding at quarter end 2012 and at year end from 2007 through 2011.  This depicts our reduction of total debt over the last several years.  Since the end of 2007 we have reduced total debt by over $700 million.  The net decrease of long-term debt of $150 million during 2012 took place during the first quarter, with the retirement of our $400 million 4.25% convertible notes net of our issuance of $250 million 4.00% notes.
 
Looking ahead, over the next 12 months we will have additional opportunities to further improve our balance sheet and reduce our effective cost of debt.
 
In summary, on slide 12:
 
 
 
 
With that, let me now turn it back over to Michael.
 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Thank you, Frank.
 
As always at this time of year, we review first half results with our operating leadership; we assess the tone of business and gauge our outlook for the balance of the year.  The tone of the business remains sound, though the overall macro economic climate will require continued vigilance and caution.  As we have shown, we are effectively managing the business to deliver on our margin objectives.
 
Overall, our pipeline remains solid, and the revenue our agencies need to convert in the back half of the year in order to deliver their plans is largely consistent with the trends from past years.
 
For the year, we remain net-new-business positive.  Significant wins in Q2 came from Bank of America, Microsoft, Unilever, SeaWorld, Aetna, Ernst & Young and MillerCoors digital.
 
We continue to see the benefits of our digital strategy, in which the primary pillar is embedding digital capabilities at all of our agencies, enhanced by best-in-class digital specialties.
 
 
7
 
Our investments in emerging markets are also being rewarded.  In the quarter, Brazil, India and China posted combined organic growth of greater than 30%, and year-to-date that number is more than 20%.  Contributions to this strong performance are coming from across the portfolio, with all three global ad networks, Mediabrands and CMG all playing a part.  The global expansion of R/GA is also taking hold and contributing to our growth, as are MRMs international operations.
 
CMG posted strong performance across the board, at Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris, as it expands its global footprint, Octagon and Jack Morton.  We saw good wins at a number of our U.S. independents and from marketing services offerings in other areas of the group, such as Momentum Worldwide.
 
Other notable events in the quarter included strong performance at Cannes, which validates the creative capabilities of many of our agencies.  Of the five Titanium Lions, awarded to ideas that redefine markets and drive exceptional business results, our agencies won two: one from Lowe in Colombia and the Titanium Grand Prix for R/GA on Nike.  R/GA also took home the Grand Prix in the digital category.
 
On the M&A front, the pipeline is strong.  We are further increasing our digital footprint, especially internationally, and are looking to add to our presence in emerging markets, including the BRICs, but also developing economies such as Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico and Vietnam.  We also continue to look at high-growth marketing services, such as PR, shopper marketing and the more sophisticated capabilities in the healthcare space.
 
Frank mentioned the deals we closed in Q2.  In early Q3, we have already finalized transactions in the PR space in London, for a full-service digital agency in South Africa and a scientific content specialist healthcare agency in Japan.  And just recently, a leading retail design company in New York that will give Momentum an even more powerful global shopper marketing capability.  And we have a number of other transactions in process that we believe will close shortly.
 
Additional developments that bear watching are the launch by Mediabrands, one of our strongest performers, of the Brand Programming Network, a third global, full-service network that should help us be more active in the pursuit of new clients, and the continued roll-out of Cadreon, our very successful demand-side platform, which should be active in eight international markets by year end.
 
In looking at the year to date, we see that we have posted both organic growth and margin expansion for the first half.  Weve outlined for you the factors that weighed on Q2 organic revenue growth, but we also have demonstrated our ability to manage through this and deliver to the bottom line, increase EPS and continue to return capital to our owners.
 
Its important to note that our comps in the third quarter will be challenging, given that we posted organic revenue growth of 8.7% and increased margins by 350 basis points in Q3 last year.  However, as we have often indicated to you, we manage to the full year, and we set our financial objectives on a full-year basis.
 
 
8
 
For the full year 2012, our objective remains organic revenue growth of 3%.  Given our revenue performance through June, we are targeting a stronger second half to achieve this goal.  The services that we provide to our clients remain in demand due to the speed of change in digital media.  And our agency brands deliver full contemporary offerings and are competitive in the marketplace.
 
With respect to profitability, our objective remains to deliver 50 basis points of margin improvement or better.  Our ability to effectively manage expense is something that this management team has demonstrated in a range of revenue environments.
 
Focusing on our clients will be key.  Well also stay disciplined on costs and on deploying our financial resources and the strength of our balance sheet to support the needs of our business, return capital to our owners and drive shareholder value.
 
Thank you.  I will now open up the floor to questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator:
. . . Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani, J.P. Morgan. . . .
 
, :
Alexia S. Quadrani
J.P. Morgan
Thank you very much.  Could you just provide a little bit more detail on the softness in U.S. organic revenue growth in the quarter?  The comps did ease meaningfully, yet results were a little bit softer.  Was it primarily the pullback you saw among the retail clients?  And if you could also remind us what the headwinds from the account losses  the impact  will likely be in Q3?
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Yes.  Thanks, Alexia, good morning.
 
Well, first of all, as I indicated, the pullback in the U.S., we had approximately 5% headwinds in the U.S., as you know notably from the loss of Microsoft on the media side and SC Johnson.  And thats reflected in the sectors that were focusing.  The additional pullback was in particular with respect to retail.  We saw a specific pullback at some of our retail clients, as well as healthcare.  I think healthcare  everyone is seeing that because of patents coming offline and some regulatory issues, weve seen some pullback.  So, if you look at it, I think, from a combination point of view of the headwinds, which are significant, and the particular pullbacks in those lines, those particular companies and in those sectors, that accounts for the reduction in organic growth in the U.S.
 
If you pull those out  and obviously, theyre there and we recognize we have to deal with that  but our businesses otherwise are solid in terms of growth.  If you look at financial services, they grew.  Food and beverage grew.  Auto and transportation grew.  And obviously, as I indicated, consumer goods, if you just added back SC Johnson, we had a good growth in the quarter.  So I think the sense is that theres nothing fundamentally wrong with our business offerings in the U.S., and our pipeline is solid and our businesses are performing.
 
Its just taking us a little bit longer to cycle through those headwinds.  For the second half of the year, were expecting 2.5% to 3% of headwinds throughout the second half.  We dont do it by quarter, Alexia, but by year end, we will cycle through all of that.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
Any sense if the pullback in the retail group, or the retail clients, was it Q2 specific?  Or should we assume that pullback may continue to be a headwind in the second half?
 
:
Mr. Roth
You know, I wish I could tell you it was all just a timing difference.  But I think a lot of it is subject to the macroeconomic environment.  So lets assume some of it is timing, and lets assume some of it may be some type of pullback for the year.  But well see how the  frankly, well know that in the fourth quarter, when obviously those sectors are very strong for us and well see a real sense of their spend.  Weve already seen some pickups in some fall programs, and weve seen some recent wins in those categories.  So, Im cautiously optimistic.

:
Ms. Quadrani
And just one last one.  If you could update us on McCann?  I know I dont think you mentioned it was one of the agencies that were particularly strong in the quarter.  Im assuming maybe some of the retail clients were there.  Any update on McCann you could give us in the U.S.?
 
:
Mr. Roth
McCann had a solid quarter for us, and I didnt mean to exclude them.  I think the transformation of McCann is moving on.  Weve made some personnel changes that are very strong in terms of taking us into the future.  Weve had our operating review with Nick and the team, and theyre confident in their ability to deliver on their results.  And we support them in terms of  some of the acquisitions weve been doing are in support of their offerings, particularly in the healthcare side of the business, which is very solid.  The Worldgroup piece of the business, particularly Momentum and MRM, have very strong offerings.  And with the personnel changes and the movements were making in our offerings in McCann, were comfortable with the transition, and were watching it go forward.  So, frankly, the results in the quarter were solid for McCann.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
All right.  Thank you very much.

Mr. Roth
Thank you, Alexia.

Operator
Our next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. . . .
 
David Bank,
RBC Capital Markets
:
Thanks, guys.  Two questions.  The first is, you clarified the 3% organic revenue growth target, but, given the volatility between domestic and international, I was wondering if you could give a little more clarity on what the acceleration you were expecting, or change in conditions you are expecting, between those two geographic categories for the balance of the year.  And the second is, could you give, talk about the ORION-Pitney Bowes partnership, and how that impacts the business itself in terms of potential operating savings for you and potential revenue growth?  Thanks.
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Let me take Pitney Bowes first.  In the interest of full disclosure, Im on the Board of Pitney Bowes.  By the way, there was  I can officially say this  there was no connection between my involvement of this and the relationship with IPG and Pitney Bowes.  We have ORION Trading, which is one of our successful units, part of Mediabrands.  They have very strong, unique offerings, particularly in the barter side of the business.  They saw a niche in terms of the ability to provide some outsourcing of printing facilities, and frankly they were looking for a partner that can deliver on a global basis, and Pitney Bowes was able to do that.  I think its a unique offering.  We think theres a huge opportunity for us in terms of servicing clients.  This isnt necessarily just for IPG.  This is for an offering of ORION Trading to the marketplace.  So its a unique offering.  We already have some business in the pipeline.  But that one is just a new offering.  Were excited about it.  Were particularly excited  I am  that it relates to Pitney Bowes.  But we will see that as it unfolds.  Its a very unique offering.  It provides savings on the printing side.  So far its been well received in the marketplace.
 
 
11
 
As far as the organic challenges for us, look, the U.S. is still obviously  it provides 57% of our revenue for the first six months, and then generally thats where we are for the full year.  Its an important part of our offering.  Our independents as well as our global networks have strong offerings in the United States, as well as the rest of our businesses, marketing services, PR.  These are very solid offerings, and theyre performing well.  Were very comfortable with these offerings.
 
If you look at the macroeconomic environment, the United States growth, depending on whose forecasting you use, is in the low single-digit numbers.  So what weve put out for the year of 3% organic growth reflects those types of markets, as well as cycling through our headwinds that we have from lost clients.  Obviously, a significant part of our growth comes from our existing client base.  We have a couple of new wins that weve announced; we have a couple that are yet to be announced; and we have some pitches out there that we are in the finals on.
 
So all of this, as we roll it all up, counts on a recovery, a growth, in the United States, but not as large as were seeing in the emerging markets.  AsiaPac, Latin America: weve seen strong double-digit growth.  And thats consistent with what were forecasting from a global perspective.  So, if you look at our business, you see our business lining up pretty much where the growth in the world is, and were falling in line with that.  And that tells us that were very competitive in all of those markets, and, as a result, were comfortable with the numbers that were putting out there.
 
:
Mr. Bank
Do I take away from that, that your outlook for the outside-of-U.S. market should be pretty consistent with what weve just seen?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, a lot of it has to do with our comps to last year.  For example  we were just looking at it this morning  Brazil, we were up organically 50%.  Thats a pretty good number.  If I could tell you we can grow our business 50% every quarter, Id be a happy camper.  So part of it has to do with our comps.  But we do believe solid double-digit growth is consistent with the macro forecast that were seeing, and were delivering on those kind of results and, frankly, in some markets better.  Though I think that clearly is consistent with the marketplace.
 
We always have to put in the caveat of the macroeconomic.  We had some good news this morning in terms of the European issues.  But we dont get  thats todays news.  Who knows whats going to be tomorrow?  So thats why we always say were cautious, because obviously this will spill over to other markets if we dont solve these problems.  But our numbers are consistent with the global forecasting that weve seen out there.

Our next question comes from John Janedis of UBS. . . .
 
,:
John Janedis
 
UBS Securities
Thank you.  Good morning, guys.  A couple of questions.  One: Michael, if you look back historically, do retailers tend to be a leading indicator for the broader client base that you have?  And then, maybe from a margin perspective, if you cant hit the 3%, Im wondering how much below that 3% organic can you do and still hit that 50-basis-points-or-more target of margin?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Weve always said, John, if we see slight organic growth, we can expand margins.  I think we said that on Investor Day when you asked the same question.  [laughter]  And I think weve shown our ability to manage our expenses very carefully.  Now, in order to continue to grow margin in a lower-growth environment, we have to be able to do that.  And I think if you look at our track record, youve seen us do that. So were very comfortable with our ability to manage our margins in even a small-growth environment.
 
And I think this quarter is a perfect example of how that works.  Were ahead of the issue.  We knew we had some headwinds, we knew we lost some business.  We had to take some costs out of the business.  And as we pick up new business, we add staff.  And we only add staff as it follows the revenue.  So I think  I hope  were getting credibility on the ability to manage even in a lower-growth environment.
 
As far as retail being a leading indicator, certainly, some of this is unique to specific clients, if you will, and their challenges in terms of margin improvement and footprint.  Some retailers are using this as an opportunity to gain market share.  So, although its some leading indicators, certainly on the consumer side, I wouldnt use it as a major indicator for our global revenue.
 
:
Mr. Janedis
Thanks, Michael.
 
And then, Frank, maybe a quick one for you.  Youve done a great job over the years on the O&G line.  Historically, youve obviously talked about the leverage in the SRS line and the need to see the revenue growth to do that.  Assuming you do get to that 3% organic, can we see the improvement in that line this year?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.  John, weve seen it.  If you look at year-to-date, weve seen SRS in the trailing 12 months; weve got 70 or 80 basis points of incremental leverage.  So thats there.  As you well know, that is going to be a key component of us closing the gap between our current margin performance and competitive margins.  Were getting to the point in O&G, especially in occupancy  well continue to focus on it, but most of the runway going forward is going to have to be in the SRS area.  And we have seen progress.

Mr. Janedis

Mr. Roth
I might add, if you look at our footprint in terms of our real estate footprint, I think weve always said  weve done a tremendous job on that, but we keep seeing new opportunities.  I think our results for this quarter are reflective of the fact that when we see opportunities to consolidate space, to be more efficient in terms of feet  per square foot per individual  weve been doing a great job of that, and were seeing the effects of that.  And we keep doing it and we expect to continue to keep our eye on those opportunities.

Our next question comes from Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank. . . .
 
,:
Matt Chesler
 
Deutsche Bank Securities
Good morning.  It seems to be that, as you look through the quarters that that last month sort of drives the full-quarter result.  If you look back at the second quarter, was there anything about June that either increased your confidence in the full year or made you a little bit more cautious?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
I think its a fair question.  We looked at June and thats where we saw a big impact on the U.S. side of the business.  Thats where, frankly, the specific client spend that we were looking for really showed up.  So, hopefully, as I indicated, some of that is timing and well see a pickup on that.  I think as the economy unfolds for the rest of the year, that will decide whether that pullback is greater or less for the rest of the year.  But it was in June and mainly it was in the U.S.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
I cant help but ask you if youve seen any of that continue into July?
 
:
Mr. Roth
[laughter]  Weve been focusing on preparing for this call.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
 
[laughter]  All morning.
 
14
 
:
Mr. Roth
[laughter]  Thanks, Matt.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
On the buyback 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
 you indicated its going to pick up in the back half of the year.  Should we have any expectation as to whether it ought to be proportional to your cash flow?  Its kind of hard for that to be  since the first half of cash flow is negative, and it should be positive in the second half.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, thats why we say weve been a little bit less in the first half, and we expect to ramp it up in the second half.  We have a $300 million authorization from our Board.  We never said that we were going to take the whole $300 million and do it all in one year.  But it looks like were spending a fair amount of it.  And if you read into my statement that well be a little more aggressive in the second half of the year, thats exactly what it means.  So if we spent $118 million to $120 million in the first half of the year, and I indicate that were going to be a little more aggressive in the second year half, then our intention is to be more aggressive, so I think can you interpolate from that.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
Whens the next opportunity that the Board can discuss revisiting or upping that allocation?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, the Board can do it any time they want, but we like to do this on a regular basis.  So come next year, we will take a look at our authorizations, obviously on the dividend as well as the buyback.  Weve had some healthy discussions with our investor base as to their preference as to whether dividends make more sense than buybacks.  At that point in time, well make a presentation to our Board, and they will make a determination of what we do with our cash flow and any excess cash we have on our balance sheet.  And well be responsive to what the marketplace is looking at.  Of course, we have to be sensitive to any potential changes in tax law as to whether dividends are preferable to buybacks.  All of that gets factored in.
 
We also have a little thing called Facebook investment.  If you recall, the last time when we did have an opportunity to sell our Facebook shares, we used that as an opportunity to use the entire proceeds from that transaction to increase our authorization.  In November, our restrictions on our Facebook shares come off, and were free to do with whatever we decide to do.  Weve indicated that our Facebook investment is not strategic, and well be opportunistic in the marketplace.  And what we do with the proceeds, if and when we sell, will be up to our Board and market conditions.  So thats another avenue we have in terms of returning money to our shareholders.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. . . .
 
:
Benjamin Swinburne,
Morgan Stanley
Thanks, good morning.  I wanted to ask you guys a little bit on the revenue outlook as well.  You called out a 5-point hit to U.S. organics in Q2 from account losses.  Can you help us think about Q3 and into Q4?  That would seem to be a number youd have a decent grasp on, just because you obviously know what happened last year.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
I think what we said was, we said for the second half of the year  not by quarter  we have 2.5% to 3% as it rolls off.  By December, all of it will have rolled off, and we start 2013 afresh.  We dont  
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
 Just to be clear, 2.5% to 3% is overall, or is that the U.S.?  I think the 5 points was the U.S. number.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Correct 
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 correct.  We said 3% for the year, first-half weighted.  So first half is in the 3-and-a-half range.  That would infer the back half is something less than 3%.  And to Michaels point, we havent given any color around quarters.  Thats for the back half of the year.
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
Okay.  And then you mentioned the Latin American comp.  I dont know if you have a basis point number youd throw out for that piece.  I know Q3 was up a lot last year, particularly in Brazil.  But you can see it in the LatAm numbers.  Just trying to think, it would seem like Q3 is a tough comp in general, and so I just wanted to ask about that piece as well.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, we had 8.5% revenue in the third quarter last year.  Thats a pretty tough comp in this environment.  And last year in the third quarter  if you recall, last year, our second quarter, we had some Latin American revenue that slipped from the second quarter to the third quarter.  And that was in that comp number last year.  So what that says is, we continue to be bullish about our outlook for Brazil and Latin America.  We have a tough comp, but we still think that businesses there are solid, across the board.  And for the year, were comfortable with how it folds into our overall number.
 
 
16
 
:
Mr. Swinburne
Right, okay.  And then just going back to the cash flow statement on acquisitions.  Last year, you sort of underspent your budget for the year.  It sounds like youve got a lot of activity going on currently.  I dont know if theres any way to put a finer point at what you expect for acquisition spend for the year in 2012?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
We had said about $200 million of new money for the year.  Thats still probably a pretty good number.
 
:
Mr. Roth
By the way, thats just a guideline.  If we see some really attractive transaction out there that that we cant pass on, well look at it.  But so far we havent seen that.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
And to your comment on underspending last year, the reason we underspent: there was a number of transactions that were deep into the pipeline.  They just didnt close until this year.  So the pipeline has been consistently robust.  Actually, for the past three years.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Whats encouraging is that our acquisitions are across the board.  All our different segments and agencies, on a global basis.  Obviously, theyre digital.  Weve had some search companies in the mix.  We have healthcare companies.  We have PR companies.  We have digital companies, both in Europe and Latin America and India.  So, I like the fact that we are spending our money where the growth is.  And thats obviously good.  And were enhancing our offerings where we need it.  So in McCann, for example  the question is about McCann  we added to their healthcare offerings.  We added  we will be adding  something, hopefully, in the digital capabilities in Europe.  So I think this is a good opportunity for to us enhance our overall offerings, and there are some transactions there that we find very attractive.

Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. . . .
 
 
17
 
,
Peter Stabler
 
Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for taking the question.  Good morning.  So, a couple questions.  First on CMG: continued strong growth there.  I know that the PR assets are best-in-class.  Can you give us a sense of your visibility into subsequent quarters on PR?  On all of CMG, for that matter?  Then Ive got a quick follow-up, thanks.
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.  You know, its always scary.  CMG  we like to think of CMG as a retainer-based recurring model.  Were doing a lot of things, particularly in the PR side and the event side, that will enable them to do that.  But we still have a long way to go.  We have what is known as to-be-generated, where the business that we hopefully identified but havent yet realized.  And in the CMG space, thats a big number because thats the nature of their business.  Its project-oriented.  And whats interesting is, every year we go through the angst of going through that.  And every year, they do great.
 
Thats a credit to our people, both at Weber Shandwick and now GolinHarris is rolling out on a global basis and having great traction.  Jack Morton, as well as Octagon and FutureBrand, are having very solid years.  But its a sort of bite-your-fingernails business, but were very fortunate: when you have best-in-class offerings, they continue to deliver.  And I dont see any reason why they shouldnt continue to do that.  Theyre gaining market share.  Its not just growth in the business.  When you look at our competitors results, particularly in the PR side, where we do have some visibility into what our competitors are doing, I think you continually see Weber Shandwick outperform our competitors on the PR side, and thats a tribute to the business.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
Okay, great.  And then the new business success that you called out, Michael.  Just given the fact that 3% still remains a target, 2Qs a large quarter: weve got to assume really pretty substantial growth in the second half.  Can you give us a sense whether those new business wins  it seems like theyre going to be full contributors for both Q3 and Q4.  Its not as if some of these things are going to ramp really slowly and only trickle in later in the year.  Is that a fair assessment?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes.  I mean, like I said, were counting on a stronger back half of the year, and certainly some of the wins that weve already achieved are in those numbers.  Frankly, theres a couple of wins in there that we havent announced, that we hope to see flow through, particularly in the fourth quarter, and hopefully well be able to announce some of those wins as well.
 
We dont just pick these numbers out of the air.  Each of our business units do a rollup of where their pipeline is and where their new business flows in, and thats how we develop the numbers that we use.  So, clearly, new business is an important part of it.  The real strength in our company is growth from our existing businesses.  And thats where its at.  And like I said, in some of our existing clients, we already see some fourth quarter campaigns that were going to be working on, which is giving us some comfort, obviously, as we go forward.

Mr.
Stabler
:
And, lastly  I know that U.K. is a real small number so we have to be very careful with the organic growth numbers here  but do you see an Olympics bump here?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Actually, we will see a small Olympic bump, particularly on the events side of the business, because thats where you see it.  And we will see a small bump.  But its not going to make the year, if you will.  But its nice to see, and were excited about it.

Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. . . .
 
, :
Daniel Salmon
BMO Capital Markets
Good morning, guys.  Michael, you mentioned  you noted that across the industry theres a lot of weakness in healthcare, but also cited it as one of the areas where youre investing in.  Are there drugs in your clients pipelines that youre seeing?  Are there specific areas of healthcare that you see rebounding thats driving that investment?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Thats a great question.  Obviously, its certainly, its a question that our Board asks.  If theres softness, why are you doing these acquisitions?  So its a fair question.  Look, we think healthcare is very important.  Were very strong, first of all, in our offerings.  All of our global networks, Lowe, Draftfcb and McCann, have very strong healthcare offerings.  We have strong healthcare offerings on the PR side of the business as well, as well as the event business.  So, we see that as a very important segment of what we do.  And, frankly, yes, there will be new drugs coming down the pipeline.
 
Just to give you an idea: healthcares about 15% of our overall business, which is a nice sector for us.  And yes, as theres consolidation in that business, but the research extending through all of these things are an important piece of this, and we have the digital offerings and the data to help our clients in that environment.  So its not just patents falling off a line here.  And some of our clients are pulling back in that area, but were trying to help them.  Were here to help.  And certainly, the recent transactions that weve been doing on the research and the data and the digital part of it goes along those lines.
 
So, we still think its a great growth opportunity for us.  McCann Healthcare, for example, is doing very well, as well as our other healthcares.  And we see some unique pullbacks because of specific drugs.  And hopefully, well see them turn that around.

Nomura
:
Thank you, I have two, one for Michael; one for Frank.
  Michael, can we just go back to you on what your question for a second is?  The question was, I think, more narrow on maybe your sports and marketing offerings in the U.K.  But, in general, what kind of bump do you think you guys get from the Olympics in maybe late Q2, early 3Q?  Is there anything you can quantify for some of your sponsor work youre doing?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Yes.  Were doing it.  Obviously, theres a sum, a bump, but I dont give out the number.  Its not a material number.  Frankly, were more excited about whats happening in Brazil.  The FIFA cup we see as a big opportunity for us.  We have strong offerings down there.  Weve already won some assignments for the FIFA cup, and were going to have a very strong presence there, as well as the Olympics in Latin America.  So frankly, were looking more forward to those Olympics than what were seeing here in the U.K.
 
As you know, you may not know, McCann did the advertising for the London Olympics.  Wasnt a big revenue generator for us, but it gave us more exposure, and thats what we were looking for in that market, particular marketplace.  So Olympics is a good thing for us.  Its a good chance for to us meet some clients and work with them, but it isnt a big revenue enhancer for us.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
And then to Frank, I know generally you shy away from giving too much color or forward guidance, but when you look at your incremental margins, and look at your third quarter margin from last year  which was the highest margin, I think, third quarter weve seen maybe in a decade, right?  we look at this years incremental margin for the rest of the way.  Should we be expecting this to be more heavily fourth-quarter-weighted than its been in a long time?  So how should we prepare our own thinking about the margin lift for the rest of the way?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Michael, your comment about the third quarters exactly right.  It was the strongest revenue growth and margin growth weve seen here in a decade.  So, were looking, talking, full year.  For the back half of the year, itll put a lot of the growth pressure on the fourth quarter.
 
:
Mr. Roth
And, Michael, thats why  its not just because we had a little issue in the second quarter that we talk this way.  When we were overperforming in the first quarter, we said the same thing.  You have to look at this business on a full-year basis.  We dont have  our clients arent interested in our quarterly performance.  And it doesnt come in on a level basis.  So, it really doesnt make sense.
 
 
20
 
I know you have to put together a model.  I know you have to extend out what this all looks like, but we truly manage our business on a full-year basis.  Our expense profiles are on a full-year basis, our revenue forecasting, our new  everything is on a full-year basis.  So its kind of frustrating 
 
Put it in context  and I said this last year, Ill say it again  if you look at our quarter, we have $1.7 billion of revenue in the quarter.  The differential is $35 million, if you were to take a consensus number on the revenue number versus where were at.  $35 million in a quarter on a $1.7 billion.  For a full year  its not insignificant in the quarter, but for the full year  we manage our business, and all of this gets factored into it.  Which is why, even in the first quarter when we outperformed, we stuck to our target of 3% organic growth.  And everyone kept saying, well, why arent you upping that?  And the answer was, we werent upping it because we know that we have headwinds.  We know that this is a full-year business.  And thats how we manage our business.  I wish I could tell you what its going to be in the third quarter, but we cant.

Tim, we had said 37% for the full year was a reasonable number.  And we still think thats a reasonable number.  We had a number of discrete items this quarter that pushed it down to 32%, 33%.  But 37% is probably a good number for the year.  And on the NOLs, youre exactly right.  Were overweight in the NOLs in Europe.  Europe profitabilitys key to that.
