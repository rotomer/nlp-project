Summary
Revenue
Operating Results
Net Results
 
 
 
This year has proven to be more challenging on the revenue front than anticipated, but we continue to manage the business effectively and will deliver increased full-year profitability relative to 2011, said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO.  We will also continue to use our strong balance sheet to drive shareholder value.  While the third quarter showed strength internationally and in emerging economies, as well as from our digital offerings across the portfolio, this was not enough to offset incremental client caution being felt across our industry, the effect of client losses from last year and the comparison to very strong growth in the third quarter of 2011.  With full-year 2012 organic revenue growth of at least one percent and a continued focus on costs, our target of a 50 point basis point improvement in operating margin remains attainable.  We have the tools to help clients succeed in today's complex consumer and media landscape and, for 2013, we are positioned to achieve competitive top line growth, further margin expansion and continued return of capital to our owners.

COMPANY PRESENTATION AND REMARKS
 
:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Interpublic Group third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. . . .  I would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.
 
 
,:
Jerry Leshne
 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you.  Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 
We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com, and will refer to both in the course of this call.  This morning we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler.  We will begin with prepared remarks, to be followed by Q&A.  We plan to conclude before market open at 9.30 a.m. Eastern.
 
During this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our company, which are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement included in our earnings release and the slide presentation, and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
 
At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.
 
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us for our review of our third quarter and nine months 2012 results.  As usual, Ill begin by covering key highlights and developments.  Frank will then provide additional financial detail.  Ill conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by the Q&A.
 
Beginning with revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease of 0.9% was made up of 5.2% international growth and a 5.4% decrease in the U.S.  These results reflect greater caution on the part of our clients, particularly in September, headwinds from 2011 losses and extremely challenging third quarter comparisons.
 
As youll recall, our industry-leading growth of 8.7% in last years third quarter was driven by 10% growth in the U.S. and benefitted from a revenue shift of $26 million from Q2 into Q3.  In addition, we continued to see the impact from last years account losses, which was 2.5% in the quarter, most notably in the Consumer Goods sector.  And in the U.S., that number was approximately 4%.
 
In the U.S., we had growth at our media businesses, our digital agencies and the marketing services specialists in our CMG segment, as well as a number of our integrated U.S. independents.  From a sector perspective, we grew in the Auto and Financial Services verticals, while the softness that we noted on our second quarter call in the Pharma and Retail sectors continued in Q3.
 
 
 
 
The solid international results were on top of an outstanding performance in several markets a year ago.  We were led by our U.K. market, with an organic increase of 25%, which included several large assignments related to the Olympics.  The AsiaPac region had solid growth on top of a 15% increase a year ago.  In LatAm, organic growth was flat from last year, but its worth noting that Q3 last year featured over 20% growth in LatAm, and the region is up almost 10% organically year-to-date in 2012.
 
Turning to expenses, our results in the quarter reflect careful and effective cost management.
 
Sequentially, from Q2 to Q3 all of our major expense categories were flat or decreased.  The only exception was pass-through expenses, which are directly offset in revenue, and this was due to our high volume of Olympic projects connected to the London Games.
 
Q3 operating profit was $131 million, and operating margin was 7.9%.  Profit performance in the prior-year period was the best of any third quarter in our Companys history, which made for another tough comp.
 
Q3 diluted earnings per share of $0.15 compares to $0.16 in Q3-11, excluding the impact of our Facebook transaction a year ago.
 
In the third quarter we continued to drive value from our balance sheet.  We repurchased approximately 8 million shares in the quarter, for $83 million.  This brings our repurchases to 19 million shares and $201 million through the nine months.  Over the past twelve months, weve put approximately $600 million to work in the form of share repurchases, dividends and retiring long-term debt.
 
Diluted shares in the quarter decreased 15% from last years third quarter, due to our share repurchases and elimination of a convertible debt issue earlier this year, as well as dilution from our convertible preferred shares last year.
 
Looking ahead, Q4 is always critical since it is our seasonally largest quarter and our most significant profit contributor.  We expect to achieve revenue and profit growth in the fourth quarter.
 
With respect to the full year, we anticipate positive organic revenue performance.  Given our growth through the nine months and client caution, we now expect a lower rate of growth for the year than we had previously targeted.
 
In 2012 we will see year-on-year improvement with respect to operating margin.  On a trailing twelve months to September 30, our margin increased 30 basis points.  This demonstrates that we can enhance profitability at lower rates of revenue growth.  Once again, Q4 will be key, but we believe that with organic revenue growth of at least one percent for the full year and a continued focus on costs, a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin remains attainable.
 
 
2
 
By the end of the fourth quarter, we will finish cycling the impact of last years account losses on our top line.  Consequently, were confident that we will be in a position to grow at the rate of our industry in 2013.  Our track record of cost discipline means that, with competitive growth, we are well-positioned to achieve further margin expansion, ultimately to our stated goal of fully competitive profitability.
 
We continue to repurchase our shares, and have additional accretive opportunities in our debt profile available to us over the next nine months to drive incremental value creation.
 
Now, Ill  turn it over to Frank, and after his remarks, Ill return with some observations on the tone of our business at our agencies.
 
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.  As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 
On slide 2, youll see an overview of our results:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Turning to slide 3, youll see our P&L for the quarter.  Ill cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.  Our average basic share count for the quarter was 431 million, a decrease of 7% from a year ago, which reflects our share repurchases activity over the past twelve months.  Average dilutive shares for the quarter decreased 15%, which also reflects the retirement of convertible debt earlier this year, and dilution from our convertible preferred shares in Q3 2011.
 
Turning to operations on slide 4, beginning with revenue:
 
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moving to slide 5, revenue by region:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4
 
 
On slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing-twelve-month basis.  The most recent data point is 1.4%, which is updated to include Q3 2012.
 
Moving on to slide 7 and our operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
On slide 8, we show our operating margin improvement on a trailing-twelve-month basis, with the most recent data point of 9.4% for September 30.
 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet, on slide 9:
 
 
 
 
On slide 10 we turn to cash flow for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
On slide 11, you see our total debt outstanding at the end of Q3 as well as our year-end from 2007 through 2011.  Our total debt reduction since the end of 2007 has been nearly $700 million, to the level you see here of $1.68 billion.  Over the next nine months, we will have additional opportunities to address nearly half of our outstanding total, to further improve our balance sheet and reduce our effective cost of debt.  In March of next year we can call our $200 million of 4.75% convertible debt, which includes 17 million dilutive shares.  In July we have the option to call our 10% $600 million senior notes at a price of 105.
 
Turning to slide 12, in summary, we are managing a challenging top line with disciplined cost control.  We continue to utilize our balance sheet to drive value, with additional opportunity in front of us.  And we remain confident of our ability to drive margin improvement with sustained growth.
 
With that, let me now turn it back over to Michael.

:
Mr. Roth
Thank you, Frank.
 
Well as we already noted, during the third quarter the combination of increased client caution, steep comps, especially in the U.S., and headwinds from 2011 client losses, again concentrated in the U.S., outweighed our growth internationally and at a number of our agencies.
 
The momentum at Mediabrands and across the CMG portfolio continues to be positive.  Those agencies are picking up new assignments, building leading-edge digital expertise and winning market share, particularly in Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris.  We are also seeing strong performance at R/GA and HUGE, as well as within the digital capabilities embedded throughout all our agencies, including the U.S. independents.
 
Draftfcb has made progress in replacing revenue from two large client losses, developing its offering in digital and marketing services and effectively managing costs.  Lowe continues to build on its leadership position with Unilever and as a top creative network focused on emerging markets.  The transformation at McCann continues, major clients are increasingly seeing the best of its integrated marketing solutions, and we are committed to supporting this great brand by investing in its talent and its resources.
 
New business performance this year is on a more solid footing, and we were net new business positive through the third quarter.
 
Year-to-date, performance in the BRIC markets has been very strong, with growth north of 12%, on top of even better performance in 2011.  Relative to our peers, we are very competitively represented in emerging economies in our revenue mix, so we should continue to enjoy the benefits of being in those higher-growth markets.
 
We have outstanding agencies in India and Brazil, across all our global networks.  Brazil and Argentina are also [proving] to be promising markets for our digital agencies and a great source of digital talent.  As weve said before, our investment in China will largely be organic, through talent acquisition and development.
 
In the other high-growth area of the business, digital, we continue to see significant progress across the portfolio.  This is an area that has contributed very good growth year-to-date.  Well stay focused on adding to our capabilities through hiring and training, as well as incubation of new capabilities, such as MAP, our digital audience platform and automated trading desk.  Well also support further international expansion for R/GA and HUGE, on top of a tactical digital M&A activity at our major global networks.
 
To reiterate, we expect to see organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and to achieve positive organic revenue performance for the full year.
 
We are committing to delivering year-on-year improvement in operating margin for 2012.  From the second to the third quarter of this year, we continued to demonstrate strong expense management.  In fact, over the past 12 months, organic cost increases have lagged organic revenue growth.  Therefore, as mentioned earlier, a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin remains attainable with annual organic revenue growth of at least one percent.
 
 
7
 
Its worth noting that our 2012 incentive compensation plans were built around the revenue and margin targets we set going into this year, so accountability for performance against these goals is very much in place.
 
Looking forward, we should be going into 2013 in a much better position than we did this year.  Were positioned to achieve competitive growth, which in turn will allow us to deliver further margin expansion.  Weve also called out additional opportunities in our debt profile that will present themselves in the next nine months.  And our share repurchase and dividend programs will continue to be strong drivers of value creation.
 
While this year has proven to be more challenging on revenue than anticipated, we continue to manage the business effectively.  The quality of our offerings is sound, and were focused on making improvements where and when required.  We have great digital expertise and presence in high-growth emerging markets.  Above all, our ability to help clients manage in an increasingly complex consumer and media landscape represents a significant opportunity.
 
These factors position us well for the balance of this year and to create shareholder value in the years to come.
 
Thank you.  Ill open up the floor now for questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator:
. . . Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMC. . . .
 
, :
Alexia S. Quadrani
J.P. Morgan
Thank you very much.  If you can give us a little bit more color on the weakness in the U.S.  How much worse was September versus the rest of the quarter?  Anything one-tim-ish in it, or should we assume that the pull-backs will continue?  I know you had some very difficult comps in the quarter; just trying to quantify how much the weakness was sort of incremental client caution that you mentioned, or just some sense of what the trend is in the underlying business going into Q4.
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
You know, Alexia, we were positive in July and August in terms of organic growth.  Frankly, the decline in September was a bit of a surprise to us.  But frankly, were seeing that in our whole industry.  I think weve seen it in all of our peers who have mentioned it.  Obviously, there werent any one specific items that caused that, and what were seeing as a general tone is this concern and uncertainty with respect to the macroeconomic environment.  And I think not just our industry, I think weve seen it in  with respect to all industries, that weve seen caution in terms of expenditures, and until this macro uncertainty is removed, we cant say with certainty what the outcome is going to be.
 
That said, fourth quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter.  And remember, last year in the third quarter we had this shift from the second quarter into the third quarter of a single item of around $28 million, which distorted the comps.  So I think what were seeing is consistent with what the industry is, taking into account our comps of last year and some client losses.
 
And were cautious, but as I indicated, what were saying is, with at least 1% organic growth for the year, we should be able to expand our margin to at least the 50-basis- point mark that we had indicated.  But theres some uncertainty out there, and I think were just going to have to manage our business.
 
The cost controls that we have within our company are coming through very strongly, and you see that.  And of course, our model is a variable-cost-based model, which is how you see the change in our incentive comp, which reflects it.  Remember, our businesses are compensated  including the corporate, by the way  on revenue and margin.  So when you see a pullback in either of those two, then theres adjustments in our incentive comp.  Thats how our model is built, and thats how our forecast and our modeling going forward takes into consideration.
 
:
Ms. Quadrani
When you look at a very strong performance you had in the U.K., you mentioned the Olympics obviously was a big factor there.  Could you tell us if you would, if you think you wouldve had positive organic growth in the U.K., aside from the Olympics?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yes.  It wouldnt have been 25%, but the answer is yes.

Ms. Quadrani

Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura. . . .
 
Michael Nathanson
,
 
Nomura
:
Thanks.  I have three for you.  Just following up on the Olympics question: if you guys had the pass-through costs of $21, then logic would say that the revenues are going to be similar, in the low-$20-million range, right?  Thats a logical assumption?
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
There some margin in that number, Michael.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Right, so a little margin.  Okay, I just wanted to get that clear.  Second thing is, going back to the weakness of September, at what point when you are in the fourth quarter do you feel that you have a handle on fourth-quarter organic?  Is December the most important month in the quarter, or will two of the three months give you confidence?  At what point, when you come back to the market, do you have a better sense of what the fourth quarter looks like on organic?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Remember, a lot of our project business is in the fourth quarter, and December is the critical month.  If you remember, historically, whenever you look at whether there were good years or bad years, and certainly  not that I think were in that position  but when we saw in 2008, December is when it really came  basically, the project business stopped, okay?  We dont expect that to happen, but certainly December is a critical month.  What we see in October and November is much to business as usual, and we just sort of see how it comes out in December, and we wont have visibility into that until were close to it.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Ok, and the last question is for Frank.  On the flexibility of costs in the fourth quarter, aside from comp  the performance comp  is there anything else you have in terms of flexibility that you could bring down if you see that organic revenue coming down, or are you pretty much locked in with a lot of your cost buckets in the fourth quarter?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
Michael, the biggest thing, as you know, with fourth quarter being our largest revenue quarter from a seasonality perspective, youve got correlated sequential growth in expenses.  Were very focused now on managing that sequential increase in cost against that revenue.  So thats the message out for everybody is, focused very hard on what our run rate was coming in Q3, be very disciplined about adding costs as that seasonal revenue comes in on in Q4.
 
 
10
 
:
Mr. Roth
This doesnt start  the basics for us of your question  this doesnt start tomorrow, all right?  At the end of the second quarter, we did our bottom-up, and we said we better be careful with our cost increases.  So we started managing those cost items that potentially are variable at the end of the second quarter, and youre seeing some of that right in the third quarter.  So I think thats a good example of how we are  we have visibility into the cost side of our business, and we take actions as quickly as we can to make sure that the impact of those actions that we take are felt as soon as possible.
 
:
Mr. Nathanson
Okay, thanks.

Mr. Mergenthaler
Youre welcome.

Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. . . .
 
:
Hersh Khadilkar
,
Morgan Stanley
Hi, this is Hersh Khadilkar, actually, on behalf of Ben.  Just wondering, given the more cautious tone on top-line environment, does it change your view on the buyback pace for this year and next?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
No.  I think thats one of the great stories of our Company, and that is, we have a very strong balance sheet.  We continue to anticipate that to be the case, and certainly by year-end  and we continue to have an excess cash position and financial flexibility on our financing.  And as we indicated, were committed to the buyback program, and we see that as a great indication to our shareholders that we are committed to enhancing shareholder value. And therefore, thats why we put in the buyback program and the dividend in the first place, and we see no reason at this point to change our views on that.

Mr.
Khadilkar
Okay, thanks.

Thank you, and our next question comes from John Janedis from UBS. . . .
 
,:
John Janedis
 
UBS Securities
Thank you.  Frank, youve talked historically about the need for leverage in the SRS line to hit the long-term margin targets.  I think this year most of the margin leverage comes from O&G.  When we look ahead to next year, what kind of growth do we need to see on organic for improvement in SRS?  Thanks.
 
 
11
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
John, I think weve demonstrated that with growth we have gotten leverage out of SRS.  So if you look at trailing 12 months, weve generated 20 or 30 incremental basis points of margin as of September 30, and most of thats coming  or a good proportion  has come out of SRS.   So were very confident with sustained growth we can continue to drive leverage and that will be a key contributor getting us to competitive margins.

Mr. Janedis
Okay.  Separately, theres been a lot of press about the pharma category.  Michael, can you give us an update on those clients, and maybe how that might translate into a headwind next year, if at all?
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, there are a number of things that youre seeing in the pharma business.  One of note, of course, is the consolidations that are out there.  Frankly, pharma is a very important sector to us.  Healthcare is 15%, and we continue to view that as an opportunity for us, evidenced by the acquisitions that weve made in that category.
 
So what were experiencing right now is a lot of these drugs are coming off patent, but there is a pipeline of new drugs and launches.  Frankly, we are experiencing some wins in terms of new products going to market, and this is on a global basis.  I think it continues to be an important sector for us, and I think as we move out into 2013 and beyond, pharma will come back in these launches of new products, and we certainly have the capability within that sector to compete very effectively and add to our growth as a result of it.

Mr. Janedis
Thanks a lot. . . .

Mr. Roth
I might add  I know the questions are going to be on new clients.  The J&J consolidation was out there, and I know Jerry had a lot of questions of it, so let me cover some of it right now.  Good news for us on J&J, particularly on the media side.  We mentioned last quarter that J&J had a review going with respect to its European media.  I dont know if its been out in the press yet, but we did pick up incremental  on that one we werent really doing any European media business for J&J.  And we were successful in picking up new markets with respect to that review.  So were very excited about that, and it shows how strong our relationship with J&J is on the media side.
 
So the next question is, we do have a review on the U.S. side of the media, but I think the fact that we picked up incremental business in Europe is a strong indication of our relationship on J&J and how they view our media offering.  So were comfortable with that review as it proceeds.
 
On the consumer brand review that they had, again, our strength in J&J is in the Acuvue, in the pharma business, and the media business.  We had some consumer brands, particularly Tylenol, that we did lose, but, again, the overall strength of our J&J business is in the other sectors.

Thanks.  I was wondering if you get a little bit more detail about Q4 and the headwinds.  You provided us a some information  and I apologize if I missed this   could you give us a sense of what the U.S. headwinds are in Q4, and total?  And I have one quick follow-up.

Mr. Mergenthaler
Right, and for the aggregate its around 2.5%, consolidated.
 
Mr.
Stabler
:
Okay, great.  We all know that youre in the thick of talking to clients about 2013.  Commentary coming out of your European competitors suggests not just fear, I guess, but also hesitation.  Just wondering if you could give us any color of the nature of the conversations.  Do you feel like nominal GDP growth for you is realistic?  Youve already commented on your confidence around competitiveness.  But if you had take kind of an early look at 2013, any guidance would be great.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, Magna put out  they put out their release, did they not?  They did pull back slightly in terms of the macro impact on a global basis.  I think thats really what, frankly, what were seeing.  The conversations that weve been having with our multinational clients, of course, is caution, but they also are viewing this as an opportunity.  Which is exactly why youre seeing some strength in the emerging markets, because thats where our clients see the battle to be won or lost.  We are seeing very strong conversations about how they can either launch products or gain market share in those markets, and what were doing is, were putting together plans to help them effectively gain market share or launch in those areas.
 
I think that conversation and our results reflect that, that theyre still going on and I dont think youre going to see major pullbacks in those markets, because what I view as our enlightened clients view this as a good opportunity to gain market share.  So we are right next to them in terms of helping them do this.
 
Of course theres caution, as I indicated, and particularly in Europe.  Actually, when you look at our overall international results, theyre positive, which given the competitive set in that area, were very proud of the results that were seeing on the international markets.  I think theres caution, were concerned, but I dont see this as wholesale cutbacks the way we have seen in the past.

Good morning, Matt.
 
:
Mr. Chesler
Just wanted to revisit an earlier question: I think the question was, trying to get a sense for any of the revenue implications in 2013 from some of the consolidations that didnt go your way.  I know you had made a comment earlier that you were net new business positive through the third quarter, but a couple of those consolidations didnt go the way  I know some of them werent as big as the headlines appeared, but do you  as you go into 2013, whats the implications from those losses?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Yeah, I think the big one that youre referring to  we cant really comment on specific clients  but the one that youre referring to is the Pfizer consolidation.  And as we indicated, there was some impact of that.  A lot of that was local business that we already do, and its not taking into effect until the end of 2013 and 2014.  We dont have a lot of visibility into that right now, but frankly its sort of business as usual for us.  As we indicated, we didnt think thats going to be a material impact for us, certainly going into 2013.
 
On the other side of it, we have been picking up additional product launches on a global basis, whether it be at McCann Healthcare or Draftfcb.  Our pharma offering at J&J continues to see that as well.  So although there may be some exposure as a result of the consolidation at Pfizer, we are seeing some positive impacts and wins in our other pharma sectors.

Mr. Chesler
Would you go so far as to say that youre entering 2013 with a tailwind? Or is it 
 
:
Mr. Roth
I wouldnt use  first of all, I told the team I dont like to jinx things, Im kind of superstitious.  So I will keep it where it is right now, that were net new business positive for the first three quarters.

Mr. Chesler
Right.  And in terms of the buyback, do you think of your investment in Facebook as something thats supplemental to your current authorization, or that would just help you deploy what youve already committed to?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, I think if you look at our past actions, when we sold the other half, the immediate thing we did was increase our authorization.  I think that should give you an indication on how we view the Facebook proceeds, if and when we realize them.  Our lawyers are looking at me like crazy.

Mr. Chesler
Okay.  In terms of the bigger bucket for base benefits and tax, what kind of leverage and what should we be expecting in Q4?  Is it possible that could be down sequentially given that you guys got an early start

Mr. Mergenthaler
I dont expect it to be down sequentially, Matt. I do think  we are expecting to see greater leverage out of it.

Michael Roth,

Let me just comment about the Olympics.  Down the road  its not immediate  but obviously in Brazil, we have some engagements with respect to the FIFA and the Olympics in place.  So thats pretty exciting to see down the road.  There are opportunities.
 
:
Mr. DiClemente
Okay.  And then, Frank, I know you have some issues that come up in 2013.  I mean your balance sheet.  So its converts  the call, I think thats March.  Youve got 10% notes that you could potentially term out mid-year next year.  I guess the question is, is there any reason at all that you would look to refinance those issues at much lower rates?
not
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
No.
 
:
Mr. DiClemente
All right.  Thats good, okay.  Great.
 
:
Mr. Roth
You heard my comments in saying we see opportunities on our balance sheet.  Thats what we were referring to.
 
:
Mr. DiClemente
Sure.  Okay, got it, loud and clear.  Finally, Michael, for you.  I wonder, its just kind of interesting that CMOs in the U.S. wouldnt be using this type of environment with capital kind of a little bit easier to just go after market share.  I understand theres caution, but Im just wondering is there anything else going on with respect to how CMOs are looking at the world.  Are they taking incremental dollars and perhaps going some more on their own in terms of earned media?  Maybe you could just provide us an update on what youre seeing in digital and technology.  Are people maybe allocating dollars more efficiently to mobile or to social?  And just wondering if whats happening is that because usage and time spend is moving towards those types of platforms that they can perhaps spend and campaign a bit more efficiently.  Thanks a lot.
 
:
Mr. Roth
Its a great question.  The fact is, thats where a lot of the action is.  Just take a look at the increase in digital overall and you can see how its outpacing spend in other outlets.  That doesnt mean TV and cable is not growing, it is.  But the internet and digital is growing at a faster rate.  The notion of paid and earned media, youre spot on on the point of our clients are looking to us to make sure that they get better reach, more effectiveness, with less expenditure.  I was waiting to use this phrase on this call and Ill use it, and that is that confusion is good. This is where we earn our keep.
 
And, yes, the clients are saying I want to gain market share, I want to increase my exposure to the consumer base, but I want to do it in a much more efficient way.  We are seeing that, and ultimately, I dont  theyre looking to see more earned than paid, and its incumbent upon us to have the tools and resources to do that.  So we are seeing the impact of that.  Frankly, youre seeing a lot of that, a lot of the reviews that are out there are on the media side.  And the reason for it is because everyone, they are looking for efficiencies.
 
 
16
 
I might add, by the way, on the Unilever media pitch, I think that came to a close after the last announcement we had.  On that one, we retained the business we had, and we picked up some incremental business there, which also was good.
 
What theyre looking for is for us to use all the tools and resources to be more efficient in how they spend their dollars.  So its not that theyre taking the dollars and spending it elsewhere, they just want to get more for the same amount of money that they were spending.  And in some cases, theres pressure on their P&L, and theyre concerned about where to spend their money on a macro basis, so we see some pullback.  Thats not the same as where we experienced before just a total stop of marketing dollars.

Our next question comes from James Dix from Wedbush. . . .
 
James Dix,
Wedbush Securities
:
Thanks very much, good morning.
 
Just a couple of things.  Going back to September, which seems to have been a tough month industry-wide, do you have any other color as to where you saw, geographically, any more increased caution than anywhere else?  For the quarter, at least, your international growth beat my expectations and seemed pretty strong.  So I was curious as to whether you had any more color as to what you saw in September, specifically by geography, and whether that kind of mix of concern by geography is continuing so far in the fourth quarter?
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Yeah, I think most  not most, but a good part of it was here in the United States, and that was reflected in our results.  And frankly, the impact on retail was one of the areas that weve seen it.  I think thats where the question of macro impact of getting our act together in Congress and the uncertainties in terms of the fiscal cliff that were facing, and I think youre seeing it on the retail sector.  So its likely to spill over to a caution on the part of our clients on the retail side.  And so I think a portion of it is coming through this.
 
 
17
 
:
Mr. Dix
Okay, great.  And then, secondly, if you are able to achieve your 1% organic growth, or at least that for the year, what are the items that could cause you to have less than 50-basis margin improvement for the year?  Is it just the mix of the growth versus head count?  Im just trying to understand how those dynamics could play out for the full year, and what youre seeing in the fourth quarter?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, one of the items thats in there, frankly, that would impact it would be severance.  To the extent we have to take actions when we see softness in the revenue, then, historically, because of our variable cost model, it comes out in headcount.  So you might see some  right now were using 1% in severance, so youll see a slight pick-up in severance.  But the rest of it is pretty consistent with what weve seen in the past.
 
:
Mr. Dix
Okay.  And I guess, finally, on incentives for the year, I know you talked about 3.5% to 4%, and it sounds like part of your lower accruals in the third quarter was due to the lower organic growth.  Any general sense at this point as to what we should be modeling for that for the full-year, or is it just too hard to say?

Frank Mergenthaler

Id probably say 3% to 3.5%.

David Bank,
RBC Capital Markets
:
Hey, thanks.  Good morning, guys.
 
,:
Frank Mergenthaler
 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, David.
 
:
Mr. Bank
Frank, I feel like every call for the past couple Ive asked you this question, which was, when you think about the minimum amount of tailwind you need to get to operating leverage for the 50 basis points of margin improvement, what is the minimum amount of revenue you need?  I guess the question is getting answered here, in that this year at least, it sounds like you dont need any more than 100 basis points, necessarily, to get there.  I guess Ill take one more shot at it.  What do you think is the minimum amount of revenue growth you need to get the 50 basis points of improvement?
 
 
18
 
And then, recognizing that this was a  theres a bunch of extraordinary things going on this year in terms of client headwinds and just general environment  what do you think you need on the more sustained basis over the next couple?  As you target the margin improvement, what is the minimum amount of revenue growth you think you need to get the operating leverage?  Thank you very much for taking the question.
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
Youre welcome.  Ill try again, David.  For this year, as weve called out in Michaels comments, that we believe with 1% growth, 50 basis points is attainable.  What puts that at risk is the comment Michael just made: if, in fact, as we go through 2013 planning, and revenue concerns move to next year, and we need to take action with respect to headcount  because its a variable cost model, as Michael called out  there could be some severance pressure on it, right?  If weve got to take severance actions, were going to go ahead and do that, and that may put the 50 basis points at risk.
 
:
Mr. Bank
I guess Im asking, though, could you do it at lower than 1%, or is that the 
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
We said 1% gives us  50 basis points is attainable.
 
:
Mr. Bank
Okay, understood.  And then more on a going forward basis?
 
:
Mr. Mergenthaler
Going forward, I think were still in the same place as where we were on Investor Day, when we put the longer-term model in front of the investment community.  We were at 4% to 5% growth.  We think we can get a hundred basis points of margin improvement, and were still there.  Wed like to see, as Michael said, were going to be competitive with respect to top line.  What that means, based on the macroeconomic situation, were not sure yet.  Were not ready to commit to that yet, but we think with 4% to 5% growth we get back on the margin trajectory that we called out on the Investor Day over a year ago.
 
:
Mr. Bank
But  Im sorry 
 
Michael Roth,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
:
Let me weigh in a little bit here.  Weve consistently said that what we need is growth to expand margin.  Remember, were still not at competitive margins, okay?  So were in a little different position, in terms of margin expansion.  When we say we need  whether it be 1% and we can expand margin  I think what weve shown, if you look at our results through the three months, weve had a 30-basis-point margin expansion.  The point here is that, directionally, we still have the opportunity to expand margin in the low-growth environment.  To get to the competitive margin, obviously we have to step up and have greater revenue.  But for the thesis of whether were in a position to expand our margin that we dont need those kind of growth levels to consistently do that because of the variable cost model that we have.  If we werent managing our costs as effectively as we are, then we couldnt make that statement.
 
 
19
 
Now, youre seeing this in, of course, all businesses now, and certainly in the United States.  The issue is a revenue issue, its not a cost issue.  Businesses have learned how to manage their costs profile.  Even though people are meeting their objectives, theyre meeting it by a cost side of the business, not the revenue.  Thats really whats driving the macroeconomic concerns, and that is, at some point in time, we have to convert to more growth on the revenue side than expense management.  Thats the concern that I think youre seeing across all sectors.  We see growth, we see margin expansion, but until we get real revenue pick-ups in terms of the macroeconomic side, thats when you see the greater expansion on the margin for us going forward.  Thats a truism.
 
:
Mr. Bank
I guess one quick follow-up.  You definitely have sort of spoiled us in your ability to generate the operating leverage off of a less-robust revenue base growth.  The question really is, and I dont know if you can answer this one, but, can you keep doing this?  If you get  no one really knows what next year holds exactly to within 100 or 200 basis points  but if you were to only grow, say, 100 basis points next year, do you think 50 bps of margin expansion is doable again?
 
:
Mr. Roth
Well, Im not going to pin 50 basis points.  What Im going to tell you, as I just said 
 
:
Mr. Bank
I tried, Michael 
 
:
Mr. Roth
That on margin for revenue growth we continue to be able to expand margin.  Yes, the answer is we can keep doing that, because we have a variable cost model.  But its not going to grow at the rate that wed like it to grow in a more robust environment.  Its not even a robust environment.  Our Investor Day, we said 4% to 5% organic growth, okay, which is historically what our industry has been able to grow.  Whats holding the industry from historically getting there has been the macroeconomics.  Remember, our position  and weve proven it  is that we have competitive offerings, so now were crossing the street with the crowd looking at macroeconomics.  And so, in a lower-growth environment, and we can still grow margin, but its not going to be at the growth rate that we would all like to see.  But its a revenue issue, its not a cost issue.

Thank you, and I have a question from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. . . .
 
, :
Daniel Salmon
BMO Capital Markets
Good morning guys, two questions.  First, notwithstanding all the broader issues youve already discussed, how are you thinking clients may time their decisions on budgets for next year in light of things like the U.S. fiscal cliff coming right up at the end of the year?  Do you expect a delay in terms of when you will be hearing back from clients?  And then, secondly, any changes in the labor market for digital talent these days?
 
 
20
 
, :
Michael Roth
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the changes are it  its not a change, it continues to be very competitive.  I think were seeing less turnover.  When you have a difficult economic environment you dont see a lot of people jumping jobs.  Still, thats the area that were still seeing a lot of competitiveness in terms of recruiting.  The good news is we have great agencies and great clients, so we have good places for those talented people to go and feel comfortable with the work theyre doing.  I think its a challenge, but were up to it and if you looked at our headcount improvement, or increase if you will, on the digital side and the media side is where were seeing our growth.  So it shows we do have the ability to hire in there.
 
When our clients are going to see the light  if everyone gets their act together and we have resolution of all the fiscal cliff and sequestration and all the stuff thats out there, then I think 2013 will be a pleasant surprise for everybody.  But were not going to see it all of a sudden in December, the flood gates arent going to open up and happy days are here again, and were looking at huge growth rates.  I think it will happen, but its just a question of when all these other issues  and Europe, lets not forget the issues in Europe  all come together.
 
And if we get resolution of all this, than I think we can return to the days when we see good solid growth in our industry, and well see the margin expansion that we were talking about.  But its not a light switch that all of a sudden they just open up the flood gates, because remember, this takes a while for people to get their plans together and for us to work with them in terms of how to spend their money.
