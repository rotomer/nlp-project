Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) today announced
 
 
Interpublic intends to use the net proceeds from the offering towards the redemption of its $200 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and its $600 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% Senior Notes due 2017. Interpublic has the right to redeem the 4.75% Notes at par plus accrued interest on or after March 15, 2013, and it has the right to redeem the 10.00% Notes at 105% of their principal amount plus accrued interest on or after July 15, 2013. If holders convert the 4.75% Notes to shares, Interpublic may apply part of the proceeds of this offering toward share repurchases under its share repurchase program. Any proceeds that are not applied as described above will be used for general corporate purposes.
This statement shall not constitute a notice of redemption under the indentures governing the 4.75% Notes and 10.00% Notes. Any such notice, if made, will only be made in accordance with the provisions of the applicable indenture.
We are pleased with the strong reception from the credit market, commented Michael I. Roth, Chairman and CEO of Interpublic Group. The combination of these new notes and our planned retirement of both the 4.75% convertible notes and the 10% senior notes will help to further improve our debt maturity profile and continue to reduce interest expense for our company. We will also eliminate share dilution due to the convertible feature of the 4.75% notes. All of these actions are consistent with our continued objective of enhancing shareholder value.
