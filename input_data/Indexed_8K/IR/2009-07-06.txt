Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited, a Bermuda company ("IR-Global"), amended and restated its commercial paper program (as amended, the "Commercial Paper Program") pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. Under the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue the Notes from time to time, and the proceeds of such financings will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be re-borrowed. Each of Ingersoll-Rand plc, an Irish public limited company ("IR-Ireland"), Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited, a Bermuda company ("IR-Bermuda"), and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited, a Bermuda company ("IR-International"), has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the Notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program.
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. will act as dealers under the Commercial Paper Program (collectively, the "Dealers") pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective Commercial Paper Dealer Agreements with IR-Global, IR-Ireland, IR-Bermuda and IR-International (each, a "Dealer Agreement" and collectively, the "Dealer Agreements"). JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, will act as issuing and paying agent under the Commercial Paper Program (the "Agent") pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement (the "IPA Agreement"). The Dealers and the Agent and certain of their respective affiliates have performed and/or may in the future perform various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for IR-Global, IR-Ireland, IR-Bermuda and IR-International and their affiliates for which the Dealers, the Agent and/or their respective affiliates have received and/or will receive customary fees and expenses.
The Dealer Agreements provide the terms under which the Dealers will either purchase from IR-Global or arrange for the sale by IR-Global of the Notes pursuant to an exemption from federal and state securities laws. The Dealer Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Notes are not redeemable or subject to voluntary prepayment by IR-Global prior to maturity. The IPA Agreement provides for the issuance and payment of the Notes and contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions.
The description above is a summary of the IPA Agreement and the Dealer Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by the IPA Agreement and the Dealer Agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, and are incorporated by reference herein.

"JPMorgan"
 
The Issuer and the Guarantor hereby request that JPMorgan act as the Issuer's issuing and paying agent in connection with the issuance and payment of certain short-term promissory notes of the Issuer (the ), as further described herein, and JPMorgan agrees to act as such agent upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.
"Notes"
 
The Issuer may establish one or more commercial paper programs under this Agreement by delivering to JPMorgan a completed program schedule (the ) with respect to such program. JPMorgan has given the Issuer a copy of the current form of Program Schedule, and the Issuer shall complete and return its first Program Schedule to JPMorgan prior to or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. In the event that any of the information provided in, or attached to, a Program Schedule shall change, the Issuer shall promptly inform JPMorgan of such change in writing.
"Program Schedule"
each
 
All Notes issued by the Issuer under this Agreement shall be short-term promissory notes, guaranteed by the Guarantor, exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and from applicable state securities laws. The Notes may be placed by dealers (the ) pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Notes shall be issued in either certificated or book-entry form.
"Dealers"
 
The Issuer shall deliver to JPMorgan a certified copy of duly adopted corporate resolutions from its Board of Directors (or other governing body) authorizing the issuance of Notes under each program established pursuant to this Agreement and a certificate of incumbency, with specimen signatures attached, of those officers, employees and agents of the Issuer authorized to take certain actions with respect to the Notes as provided in this Agreement. The Guarantor shall deliver to JPMorgan a certified copy of duly adopted corporate resolutions from its Board of Directors (or other governing body) authorizing its guaranty of the Notes and a certificate of incumbency, with specimen signatures attached, of those officers, employees and agents of the Guarantor authorized to execute this Agreement and take certain actions with respect to the Notes as provided in this Agreement. Each person named on any certificate of incumbency of the Issuer or the Guarantor is hereinafter referred to as an . Until JPMorgan receives any subsequent incumbency certificates, JPMorgan shall be entitled to rely on the last incumbency certificate delivered to it by the Issuer or the Guarantor for the purpose of determining such party's Authorized Representatives. The Issuer
"Authorized Representative"
and Guarantor represent and warrant that each of its Authorized Representatives may appoint other officers, employees and agents (the ), including without limitation any Dealers, to issue instructions to JPMorgan under this Agreement, and take other actions on its behalf hereunder, provided that notice of the appointment of each Delegate is delivered to JPMorgan in writing. Each such appointment shall remain in effect unless and until revoked by the Issuer or the Guarantor in a written notice to JPMorgan.
"Delegates"
 
If and when the Issuer intends to issue certificated notes (), the Issuer and JPMorgan shall agree upon the form of such Notes. Thereafter, the Issuer shall from time to time deliver to JPMorgan adequate supplies of Certificated Notes which will be in bearer form, serially numbered, and shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of an Authorized Representative of each of the Issuer and the Guarantor. JPMorgan will acknowledge receipt of any supply of Certificated Notes received from the Issuer, noting any exceptions to the shipping manifest or transmittal letter (if any), and will hold the Certificated Notes in safekeeping for the Issuer in accordance with JPMorgan's customary practices. JPMorgan shall not have any liability to the Issuer or the Guarantor to determine by whom or by what means a facsimile signature may have been affixed on Certificated Notes, or to determine whether any facsimile or manual signature is genuine, if such facsimile or manual signature resembles the specimen signature attached to the Issuer's certificate of incumbency with respect to such Authorized Representative. Any Certificated Note bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a person who is an Authorized Representative on the date such signature was affixed shall bind the Issuer and the Guarantor after completion thereof by JPMorgan, notwithstanding that such person shall have ceased to hold his or her office on the date such Note is countersigned or delivered by JPMorgan.
"Certificated Notes"
 
The Issuer's Book-entry notes () shall not be issued in physical form, but their aggregate face amount shall be represented by a master note (the ) in the form of Exhibit A executed by the Issuer and the Guarantor pursuant to the book-entry commercial paper program of The Depository Trust Company (). JPMorgan shall maintain the Master Note in safekeeping, in accordance with its customary practices, on behalf of Cede & Co., the registered owner thereof and nominee of DTC. As long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Master Note, the beneficial ownership interest therein shall be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof shall be effected through, entries on the books maintained by DTC and the books of its direct and indirect participants. The Master Note and the Book-entry Notes shall be subject to DTC's rules and procedures, as amended from time to time. JPMorgan shall not be liable or responsible for sending transaction statements of any kind to DTC's participants or the beneficial owners of the Book-entry Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or its participants with respect to such Notes. In connection with DTC's program, the Issuer and Guarantor understand that as one of the conditions of their participation therein, it shall be necessary for the Issuer, the Guarantor and JPMorgan to enter into a Letter of Representations, in the form of Exhibit B hereto, and for DTC to receive and accept such Letter of Representation. In accordance with DTC's program, JPMorgan shall obtain from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of CUSIP numbers for Issuer's Book-entry Notes, and JPMorgan shall deliver such list to DTC. The CUSIP Service Bureau shall bill the Issuer directly for the fee or fees payable for the list of CUSIP numbers for the Issuer's Book-entry Notes.
"Book-Entry Notes"
"Master Note"
"DTC"
 
The Issuer and the Guarantor understand that all instructions under this Agreement are to be directed to JPMorgan's Commercial Paper Operations Department. JPMorgan shall provide the Issuer, the Guarantor, or, if applicable, the Issuer's Dealers, with access to JPMorgan's Money Market Issuance System or other electronic means (collectively, the ) in order that JPMorgan may receive electronic instructions for the issuance of Notes. Electronic instructions must be transmitted in accordance with the procedures furnished by JPMorgan to the Guarantor, the Issuer or its Dealers in connection with the System. In the event that the System is inoperable at any time, an Authorized Representative or a Delegate may deliver written, telephone or facsimile instructions to JPMorgan, which instructions shall be verified in accordance with any security procedures agreed upon by the parties. JPMorgan shall incur no liability to the Issuer or the Guarantor in acting upon instructions believed by JPMorgan in good faith to have been given by an Authorized Representative or a Delegate. In the event that a discrepancy exists between a telephonic instruction and a written confirmation, the telephonic instruction will be deemed the controlling and proper instruction. JPMorgan may electronically record any conversations made pursuant to this Agreement, and the Issuer and the Guarantor hereby consent to such recordings. All issuance instructions regarding the Notes must be received by 1:00 P.M. New York time in order for the Notes to be issued or delivered on the same day.
"System"
 
(b) Upon receipt of issuance instructions with respect to Certificated Notes, JPMorgan shall: (a) complete each Certificated Note as to principal amount, date of issue, maturity date, place of payment, and rate or amount of interest (if such Note is interest bearing) in accordance with such instructions; (b) countersign each Certificated Note; and
.
Issuance and Purchase of Certificated Notes
 
(c) deliver each Certificated Note in accordance with the Issuer's instructions. Whenever JPMorgan is instructed to deliver any Certificated Note by mail, JPMorgan shall strike from the Certificated Note the word "Bearer," insert as payee the name of the person so designated by the Issuer or the Guarantor and effect delivery by mail to such payee or to such other person as is specified in such instructions to receive the Certificated Note. The Issuer and the Guarantor understand that, in accordance with the custom prevailing in the commercial paper market, delivery of Certificated Notes shall be made before the actual receipt of payment for such Notes in immediately available funds, even if JPMorgan is instructed to deliver a Certificated Note against payment. Therefore, once JPMorgan has delivered a Certificated Note to the designated recipient, the Issuer and the Guarantor shall bear the risk that such recipient may fail to remit payment of such Note or return such Note to JPMorgan. Delivery of Certificated Notes shall be subject to the rules of the New York Clearing House in effect at the time of such delivery. Funds received in payment of Certificated Notes shall be credited to the Account.
 
JPMorgan is not obligated to credit the Issuer's Account unless and until payment of the purchase price of each Note is received by JPMorgan. From time to time, JPMorgan, in its sole discretion, may permit the Issuer to have use of funds payable with respect to the Notes prior to JPMorgan's receipt of the sales proceeds of such Notes. If JPMorgan makes a deposit, payment or transfer of funds on behalf of the Issuer before JPMorgan receives payment for any Notes, such deposit, payment or transfer of funds shall represent an advance by JPMorgan to the Issuer to be repaid promptly, and in any event on the same day as it is made, from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes, or by the Issuer or the Guarantor if such proceeds are not received by JPMorgan.
 
Notice that an Issuer will not redeem any Note on the relative Initial Redemption Date (as defined in the applicable Extendible Commercial Note Announcement) must be received in writing by JPMorgan by 11:00 A.M. on such Initial Redemption Date. On any day when a Note matures or is prepaid, the Issuer shall transmit, or cause to be transmitted, to the Account, prior to 1:00 P.M. New York time on the same day, an amount of immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate principal amount of such Note and any applicable interest due. JPMorgan shall pay the interest (if any) and principal on a Book-entry Note to DTC in immediately available funds, which payment shall be by net settlement of JPMorgan's account at DTC. JPMorgan shall pay Certificated Notes upon presentment. JPMorgan may without liability to the Issuer or the Guarantor refuse to pay any Note that would result in an overdraft to the Account.
 
 
 
 
No prior action or course of dealing on the part of JPMorgan with respect to advances of the purchase price or payments of matured Notes shall give rise to any claim or cause of action by the Issuer or the Guarantor against JPMorgan in the event that JPMorgan refuses to pay or settle any Notes for which the Issuer or the Guarantor has not timely provided funds as required by this Agreement.
 
JPMorgan will in due course cancel any Certificated Note presented for payment and return such Note to the Issuer. JPMorgan shall also cancel and return to the Issuer any spoiled or voided Certificated Notes. Promptly upon written request of the Issuer or at the termination of this Agreement, JPMorgan shall destroy all blank, unissued Certificated Notes in its possession and furnish a certificate to the Issuer certifying such actions.
 
Upon the reasonable request of the Issuer or the Guarantor, JPMorgan shall promptly provide the Issuer or the Guarantor with information with respect to any Note issued and paid hereunder, the Issuer or the Guarantor delivers such request in writing and, to the extent applicable, includes the serial number or note number, principal amount, payee, date of issue, maturity date, amount of interest (if any) and place of payment of such Note.

Neither JPMorgan nor its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for any act or omission under this Agreement except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct. IN NO EVENT SHALL CHASE BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF JPMORGAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION. In no event shall JPMorgan be considered negligent in consequence of complying with DTC's rules, regulations and procedures. The duties and obligations of JPMorgan, its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be determined by the express provisions of this Agreement and they shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth herein and no implied covenants shall be read into this Agreement against them. Neither JPMorgan nor its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be required to ascertain whether any issuance or sale of any Notes (or any amendment or termination of this Agreement) has been duly authorized or is in compliance with any other agreement to which the Issuer or the Guarantor is a party (whether or not JPMorgan is also a party to such agreement).
 
The Issuer and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless JPMorgan, its directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, "indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) suffered or incurred by or asserted or assessed against any indemnitee arising in respect of this Agreement, except in respect of any indemnitee for any such liability, claim, loss, damage, penalty, cost or expense resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee. This indemnity will survive the termination of this Agreement.
 
When delivering each Program Schedule, the Issuer and the Guarantor shall deliver to JPMorgan all documents it may reasonably request relating to the existence of the Issuer and authority of the Issuer for this Agreement, including, without limitation, an opinion of counsel, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto.
 
All notices, confirmations and other communications hereunder shall (except to the extent otherwise expressly provided) be in writing and shall be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, by telecopier or by hand, addressed as follows, or to such other address as the party receiving such notice shall have previously specified to the party sending such notice:
 
 
The Issuer shall pay compensation for services pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the pricing schedules furnished by JPMorgan to the Issuer from time to time and upon such payment terms as the parties shall determine. The Issuer shall also reimburse JPMorgan for any fees and charges imposed by DTC with respect to services provided in connection with the Book-entry Notes.
 
This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue hereof.
 
This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party by written notice to the other, but such termination shall not affect the respective liabilities of the parties hereunder arising prior to such termination.
 
In no event shall JPMorgan be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder because of circumstances beyond JPMorgan's control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, war (whether declared or undeclared), terrorism, fire, riot, strikes or work stoppages for any reason, embargo, government action, including any laws, ordinances, regulations or the like which restrict or prohibit the providing of the services contemplated by this Agreement, inability to obtain material, equipment, or communications or computer facilities, or the failure of equipment or interruption of communications or computer facilities, and other causes beyond JPMorgan's control whether or not of the same class or kind as specifically named above.
 
This Agreement, together with the exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement among JPMorgan, the Issuer and the Guarantor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in all respects all prior proposals, negotiations, communications, discussions and agreements between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.
 
No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any power or right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor does any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise, or the exercise of any other power or right. Any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it is given. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each party hereto.
 
Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a business day for JPMorgan, then such payment shall be made on JPMorgan's next succeeding business day.
 
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and such counterparts together shall constitute but one instrument.
 
The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not in any way limit or otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the terms of this Agreement.
 
Each Account shall be subject to JPMorgan's account conditions, as in effect from time to time.
 
This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
 
Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and any New York State court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and of any appellate court from any thereof for the purposes of any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a ). Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of any Proceeding may be heard and determined in such Federal or New York State court and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Proceeding in any of the aforementioned courts and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Proceeding.
"Proceeding"
 
The Issuer and the Guarantor, for the benefit of JPMorgan and the holders from time to time of the Notes, hereby irrevocably appoint Ingersoll-Rand Company, with offices on the date hereof located at One Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, NJ 08855 as their agent (the ) upon which process may be served in any Proceeding and hereby agree that service of process upon the Authorized Agent, by mail or delivery, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon them in any such Proceeding.

Each of the Issuer and each Guarantor agrees that the failure of any such designee, appointee and agent to give any notice of such service to it shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of the holders of any Notes or the Dealer to serve any such legal process, summons, notices and documents in any other manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the undersigned or bring actions, suits or proceedings against the undersigned in such other jurisdictions, and in such other manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.

The foregoing indemnity shall constitute separate and independent obligation of the Issuer and each Guarantor and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Notes to a holder of any of the Notes or to the Dealer (collectively referred to as a "Payment Recipient") shall be paid without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any interest or penalty thereon imposed, levied, collected, assessed or required to be deducted, withheld or paid by or for the account of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is located (including, without limitation, Bermuda and Ireland), or any taxing authority or political subdivision thereof or therein (collectively a "Tax") unless the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Tax by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any such Tax is required by law to be withheld or deducted from any such payment, the Issuer and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree that they shall pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by a Payment Recipient after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Payment Recipient would have received if such Tax had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment made to a Payment Recipient to the extent:
(a) that any such Tax is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the existence of any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of a Payment Recipient owning such Notes or, in the case of the Dealer, becoming a party to this Agreement) between such Payment Recipient (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary or person holding a power over such Payment Recipient, if such Payment Recipient is an estate or trust, or a member of such Payment Recipient, if such Payment Recipient is a partnership or limited liability company) and the taxing authority imposing such Tax;
(b) of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or excise Tax or any similar Tax;
(c) that any such Tax would not have been so imposed but for the presentation, surrender or demand by the Payment Recipient for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable;
(d) that any such Tax is payable by any method other than withholding or deduction from payments of principal (or amounts in respect thereof) and/or interest (or amounts in respect thereof) on the Notes, on the Guarantee or on payments to a Payment Recipient;
 
18
(e) that any such Tax would not have been so imposed but for the failure by the Payment Recipient to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption (provided that the Payment Recipient is entitled to make such declaration or claim), if (i) such compliance is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulations, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing authority as a precondition to, an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Tax and (ii) at least 60 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Issuer or any Guarantor shall apply this subclause (e), the Issuer or such Guarantor shall have notified all Payment Recipients in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim;
(f) any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to an individual that is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council Meeting of 26-27 November 2000, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or
(g) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).

18
(e) that any such Tax would not have been so imposed but for the failure by the Payment Recipient to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption (provided that the Payment Recipient is entitled to make such declaration or claim), if (i) such compliance is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulations, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing authority as a precondition to, an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Tax and (ii) at least 60 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Issuer or any Guarantor shall apply this subclause (e), the Issuer or such Guarantor shall have notified all Payment Recipients in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim;

(b) The Issuer and the Guarantors agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer and each holder from time to time of Notes against any loss incurred by the Dealer or such holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made for any amount due hereunder or under the Notes or the Guarantee and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than United States dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which the Dealer or such holder, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of Judgment Currency actually received by the Dealer or such holder. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute separate and independent obligation of the Issuer and each Guarantor and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Notes to a holder of any of the Notes or to the Dealer (collectively referred to as a "Payment Recipient") shall be paid without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any interest or penalty thereon imposed, levied, collected, assessed or required to be deducted, withheld or paid by or for the account of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is located (including, without limitation, Bermuda and Ireland), or any taxing authority or political subdivision thereof or therein (collectively a "Tax") unless the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Tax by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any such Tax is required by law to be withheld or deducted from any such payment, the Issuer and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree that they shall pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by a Payment Recipient after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Payment Recipient would have received if such Tax had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment made to a Payment Recipient to the extent:
(a) that any such Tax is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the existence of any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of a Payment Recipient owning such Notes or, in the case of the Dealer, becoming a party to this Agreement) between such Payment Recipient (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary or person holding a power over such Payment Recipient, if such Payment Recipient is an estate or trust, or a member of such Payment Recipient, if such Payment Recipient is a partnership or limited liability company) and the taxing authority imposing such Tax;
(b) of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or excise Tax or any similar Tax;
(c) that any such Tax would not have been so imposed but for the presentation, surrender or demand by the Payment Recipient for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable;
(d) that any such Tax is payable by any method other than withholding or deduction from payments of principal (or amounts in respect thereof) and/or interest (or amounts in respect thereof) on the Notes, on the Guarantee or on payments to a Payment Recipient;
 
18
(e) that any such Tax would not have been so imposed but for the failure by the Payment Recipient to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption (provided that the Payment Recipient is entitled to make such declaration or claim), if (i) such compliance is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulations, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant taxing authority as a precondition to, an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Tax and (ii) at least 60 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Issuer or any Guarantor shall apply this subclause (e), the Issuer or such Guarantor shall have notified all Payment Recipients in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim;
(f) any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to an individual that is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council Meeting of 26-27 November 2000, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or
(g) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).
