Ingersoll Rand Revises Third-Quarter and Full-Year
2011 Earnings Estimates
Swords, Ireland, September 30, 2011
- Ingersoll-Rand plc (NYSE:IR), a world leader in creating and sustaining safe, comfortable and efficient environments, announced today that it has revised its estimated guidance range for third-quarter 2011 earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to $0.77 to $0.80. The previous third-quarter estimate was for EPS of $0.85 to $0.95 from continuing operations.
 
The revised third-quarter estimate includes $0.04 of EPS from Hussmann operations and excludes the impact of impairment charges. Hussmann results will be reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 and all prior periods.
Third-quarter reported revenues are now expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $3.95 billion, including approximately $200 million of revenue from Hussmann. The midpoint of the revised revenue range is $175 million below the midpoint of the prior guidance range of $4.05 to $4.15 billion, including approximately $200 million of revenue from Hussmann. Revenues were negatively affected by slower than expected end-markets in several businesses. Consumer-related businesses, such as residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), golf and residential security, were the most significantly affected, accounting for the majority of the lower volume since the previous guidance. Commercial security activity was also slower than expected. Transport, industrial and commercial HVAC revenues have remained strong. Operating income for the third quarter was negatively impacted by lower volumes and by unfavorable product mix in the residential and security segments.
Full-year EPS from continuing operations, excluding impairment charges, are preliminarily projected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.80, including approximately $0.07 per share from Hussmann. Previous guidance, including approximately $0.07 per share from Hussmann, was for EPS of $2.90 to $3.10 from continuing operations.
Full-year reported revenues are now expected to be in the range of $14.85 to $15.00 billion, including approximately $600 million of revenue from Hussmann. The midpoint of the revised revenue range is approximately $450 million below the midpoint of the prior guidance of $15.30 to $15.50 billion, including approximately $600 million of revenue from Hussmann. 
This forecast revision reflects lower than expected demand levels in our key North American residential and commercial security markets. The strengthening of the dollar against the Euro is also expected to have a negative impact on revenues versus the company's prior guidance, mainly in the fourth quarter. Full-year estimated earnings per share will be negatively impacted by lower volumes and by unfavorable product mix in the residential and security segments, partially offset by the benefit of a lower share count due to share repurchases. 
 
Ingersoll Rand is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, October 20, and will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. eastern time.
