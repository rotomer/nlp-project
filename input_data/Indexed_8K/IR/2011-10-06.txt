Other Events.
On September 30, 2011, Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR) completed the sale of a majority interest in its Hussmann business to an affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (Hussmann Parent) on the terms described in the Form 8-K filed on August 8, 2011.  A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the transaction is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
In addition to the acquisition of the Hussmann business discussed above, Hussmann Parent has the option to acquire the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches not previously included in the aforementioned sale transaction. 
If Hussmann Parent exercises its option,
IR anticipates this transaction will close, subject to certain customary conditions, on or before November 30, 2011.
IR previously announced that the sale of the Hussmann business would result in an estimated $0.30-$0.40 per share impairment charge for the third quarter.  IR determined, as of September 30, 2011, that the anticipated acquisition of the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches by Hussmann Parent will
likely result in an additional third quarter impairment charge.  IR is currently evaluating the total third quarter impairment charge and will report such charge with its third quarter results.
This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements, which are any statements that are not historical facts, including statements that may relate to the timing of the proposed transactions and the impairment charge as a result of the transactions. These forward-looking statements are based on Ingersoll Rand's current expectations and there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Forward-looking statements are subject to changes in circumstances, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements.  Political, economic, climatic, currency, tax, regulatory, technological, competitive, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these risk factors and uncertainties as detailed from time to time in the company's SEC filings, including but not limited to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
