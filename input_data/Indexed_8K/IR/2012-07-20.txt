Additional Highlights for the 2012 Second Quarter
: The company's reported revenues declined by 7 percent to $3,821 million, compared with revenues of $4,091 million for the 2011 second quarter. Total revenues, excluding the results of Hussmann, were up slightly compared with 2011 (up 3 percent excluding currency). U.S. revenues, excluding Hussmann, were up 4 percent compared to 2011, and revenues from international operations declined by approximately 5 percent (up 1 percent excluding currency).
Revenues
: Operating income for the 2012 second quarter was $478 million, compared with $299 million ($499 million when adjusted for impairment costs) for the 2011 second quarter. The second-quarter operating margin was 12.5 percent compared with an operating margin of 7.3 percent (12.3 percent excluding Hussmann results and impairment costs) for the same period of 2011. The year-over-year margin improvement was due to higher prices and productivity, partially offset by inflation, unfavorable product mix, currency translation and increased investments and restructuring costs. Results for the second quarter of 2011 also included a gain of $23 million for a property sale.
Operating Income and Margin
: Interest expense of $62 million for the second quarter of 2012 decreased by approximately $10 million compared with the same period last year due to lower debt balances. Other income totaled $4 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared with approximately $2 million of income for the 2011 second quarter. The year-over-year change was primarily due to lower currency losses.
Interest Expense and Other Income/Expense

: The company had a tax rate of 13 percent in the second quarter of 2012. The rate for the second quarter of 2011, excluding the Hussmann impairment charge, was 23 percent.

Thermo King refrigerated transport revenues declined in the second quarter compared with last year as growth in the Americas and Asia was more than offset by declines in European markets and currency translation.
Second-quarter 2012 segment operating margin was 12.1 percent, compared with 12.1 percent (12.3 percent excluding Hussmann's results) last year. 2011 operating income included a $23 million gain on the disposition of assets from a business in China. Excluding this gain, 2011 second-quarter operating margins would have been 11.1 percent.

provides products, services and solutions to enhance customers' productivity, energy efficiency and operations.

Total revenues in the second quarter of $790 million increased approximately 2 percent (up 6 percent excluding currency) compared with the second quarter of 2011.

Second-quarter segment operating margin for Industrial Technologies was 17.0 percent, and increased by 1.4 percentage points compared with last year. Margin benefits from higher volumes, improved pricing and productivity were partially offset by inflation and increased investment spending.

includes the Trane and Schlage brands, which deliver safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout the Americas. Products, services and solutions include mechanical and electronic locks, HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions and controls, and remote home management systems. Second-quarter revenues were $653 million, an increase of approximately 3 percent (up 3 percent excluding currency) compared with 2011.
Residential Solutions
Total reported residential security revenues were up low teens compared with 2011 as a result of improved sales to the new builder markets and South American customers, and higher sales from new products to "big box" customers in the United States.
Residential HVAC revenues increased slightly compared with the second quarter of 2011 and unitary air conditioning unit shipments were up high single digits compared with last year. Residential HVAC revenues from newly introduced value-priced products are exceeding initial expectations. Second-quarter segment operating margin was 7.9 percent compared with 6.4 percent recorded in 2011. The segment margin increase was due to increased volume, higher pricing and improved productivity, which were partially offset by inflation and unfavorable mix. Operating profits were also negatively impacted by the ongoing downward market mix shift to lower efficiency HVAC products.

improvements more than offset lower volumes. Revenues in overseas markets declined primarily due to currency translation. Second-quarter segment operating margin was 20.0 percent, compared with 21.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011. The lower segment operating margin was due to inflation, unfavorable revenue mix, and increased restructuring and investment spending, which were partially offset by higher productivity and improved pricing.
Balance Sheet
During the second quarter, working capital was 3.3 percent of revenues  an improvement of 1.1 percentage points compared with 2011. Cash balances and total debt balances were $0.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. The company resumed its share repurchase program in June and has purchased approximately 2.2 million shares for approximately $90 million as of July 19, 2012. The company currently expects to spend $800 million in 2012 to complete the current $2 billion share repurchase authorization.
Outlook
Ingersoll Rand's major end markets showed an uneven demand pattern in the second quarter of 2012 with moderate organic growth rates in the United States; slowing, but positive growth in Asia and Latin America; and declining activity in Western Europe. There remains sustained, but slowing, activity in the North American and Asian industrial markets. Refrigerated transport markets and commercial HVAC equipment replacement activity in North America are expected to demonstrate moderate year-over-year growth and to decline in Western Europe. The North American new commercial construction market is continuing its weak and uneven demand pattern, and activity in North American consumer-related markets, especially residential HVAC, is expected to improve moderately in the second half of 2012.
