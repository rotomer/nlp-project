Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant On June 19, 2002, Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as its independent public accountants and engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") to serve as its new independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, effective immediately. The decision to dismiss Arthur Andersen and to retain Deloitte was recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, which committee was expressly authorized to take such action. Arthur Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements between the Company and Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Arthur Andersen to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached as Exhibit 16.1 is a copy of Arthur Andersen's letter, dated June 19, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the date hereof, the Company did not consult with Deloitte with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: John F. Kenny, Jr. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (617) 535-4799 Iron Mountain Engages Deloitte & Touche LLP as Independent Auditors Boston, MA - June 19, 2002 - Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in records and information management services, today announced that it has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 replacing Arthur Andersen LLP in that capacity effective immediately. The decision to dismiss Arthur Andersen and engage Deloitte & Touche was made after careful consideration by the Audit and Executive Committees of the Iron Mountain Board of Directors and senior management. The decision was not the result of any disagreement between Iron Mountain and Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure. "It is with sadness that we end our relationship with Arthur Andersen. They have been great partners throughout our time as a public company, always professional, always providing the highest level of service," said Richard Reese, Iron Mountain's Chairman and CEO. "Unfortunately, Arthur Andersen's current difficulties and uncertain future convinced the Board that this change was in the best interest of our shareholders," he added.
