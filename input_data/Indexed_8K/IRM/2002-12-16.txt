OTHER EVENTS On December 16, 2002, we announced that we have priced an underwritten public offering of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "December 2002 Debt Offering"). We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 9-1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "9-1/8% Notes"), which was separately announced the same day, or to otherwise redeem the 9-1/8% Notes, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. Copies of our press releases regarding these events are being filed as exhibits to this report. The public debt offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement. This Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. The tender offer to purchase and consent solicitation will be made only by means of our Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated December 16, 2002 and related materials. This Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a consent solicitation with regard to the 9-1/8% Notes. We are filing certain exhibits as part of this Form 8-K. See "Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits."
We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (File No. 333-54030) on Form S-3, filed on January 19, 2001, Amendment No. 1 thereto, filed on January 29, 2001 (as amended, the "Registration Statement"), and the related base preliminary prospectus (the "Prospectus") for the registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of up to an aggregate of $500 million in our securities. On January 31, 2001, the Commission declared the Registration Statement effective. On March 28, 2001, we filed a supplement to the Prospectus, dated March 27, 2001 (the "1st Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the issuance of and sale of $225 million of 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and the use of proceeds thereof (the "March 2001 Debt Issuance"), with the Commission. In connection with the filing of the 1st Prospectus Supplement with the Commission, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 23, 2001 with pro forma information as well as certain exhibits. In addition, we filed a second Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 3, 2001 with additional information. On September 7, 2001, we filed a supplement to the Prospectus, dated September 6, 2001 (the "2nd Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the issuance of and sale of $210 million of 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and the use of proceeds thereof (the "September 2001 Debt Issuance"), with the Commission. In connection with the filing of the 2nd Prospectus Supplement with the Commission, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 6, 2001 with pro forma information as well as certain exhibits. We have filed with the Commission a registration statement (File No. 333-75068) on Form S-3, filed on December 13, 2001, Amendment No. 1 thereto, filed on February 11, 2002 (as amended, the "Second Registration Statement"), and the related base preliminary prospectus for the registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of up to an aggregate of $500 million in our securities. On February 11, 2002, the Commission declared the Second Registration Statement effective. As reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2002, we exchanged newly issued 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 for 9-1/8% Notes in a privately-negotiated transaction, which took place after September 30, 2002 and which resulted in the issuance of $46 million in face value of 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and the retirement of $45 million in face value of 9-1/8% Notes (the "Exchange"). The Exchange was recorded at the carrying amount of the 9-1/8% Notes at the date of the transaction in the amount of $43 million and in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-19, "Debtor's Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments" resulted in no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (b) Pro Forma Financial Information The primary purpose of this Form 8-K is to update previously filed pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2001 and file pro forma information for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. The pro forma information presented below was prepared as if the March 2001 Debt Issuance, September 2001 Debt Issuance, the Exchange and the December 2002 Debt Offering and the related purchase and consent solicitation had occurred on January 1, 2001.
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 The historical consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, previously filed in our Form 10-Q dated November 14, 2002, does not include the pro forma impact of the Exchange and the December 2002 Debt Offering. If we successfully complete the December 2002 Debt Offering, we intend to use the net proceeds to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our 9-1/8% Notes or to otherwise redeem the 9-1/8% Notes, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. The impact on the historical consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 of the Exchange and the December 2002 Debt Offering, assuming that the transactions had closed as of January 1, 2001 and assuming further (a) an offering price of 100.0% of the principal amount of the notes issued in connection with the December 2002 Debt Offering; (b) we retire all of the 9-1/8% Notes at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal) of 104.56%; and (c) we repay the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds resulting from the December 2002 Debt Offering, would be a decrease in interest expense of $0.4 million and an increase in income from continuing operations before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $0.2 million. The impact on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2002 would be an increase in deferred financing costs of $1.5 million, a decrease in accrued expenses of $1.4 million, a net increase in long-term debt of $9.1 million, a decrease in long-term deferred income tax liabilities of $2.3 million, and a net decrease in shareholders' equity of $4.0 million. In addition, we will record, in the quarter in which the tender offer and consent solicitation is completed, an extraordinary charge of approximately $4.0 million (after a tax benefit of $2.3 million) from the early retirement of debt. This pretax extraordinary charge of $6.2 million will consist of redemption premium and transaction costs of $3.5 million and original issue discount related to the 9-1/8% Notes of $2.7 million. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 The historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, previously filed in our Form 10-K dated March 21, 2002, does not include the pro forma impact of the March 2001 Debt Issuance, September 2001 Debt Issuance, the Exchange and the December 2002 Debt Offering. If we successfully complete the December 2002 Debt Offering, we intend to use the net proceeds to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our 9-1/8% Notes or to otherwise redeem the 9-1/8% Notes, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. The impact on the historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 of the March 2001 Debt Issuance, September 2001 Debt Issuance, the Exchange and the December 2002 Debt Offering, assuming that the transactions had closed as of January 1, 2001 and assuming further (a) an offering price of 100.0% of the principal amount of the notes issued in connection with the December 2002 Debt Offering; (b) we retire all of the 9-1/8% Notes at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal) of 104.56%; and (c) we repay the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds resulting from the December 2002 Debt Offering, would be a decrease in interest expense of $0.6 million and a decrease in loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items of $0.4 million. In addition, we will record, in the quarter in which the tender offer and consent solicitation is completed, an extraordinary charge of approximately $4.0 million (after a tax benefit of $2.3 million) from the early retirement of debt. This pretax extraordinary charge of $6.2 million will consist of redemption premium and transaction costs of $3.5 million and original issue discount related to the 9-1/8% Notes of $2.7 million.

Inc. is acting as representative (the "REPRESENTATIVE"), an aggregate of $100,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 7-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "NOTES"). The Notes will be irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed (the "GUARANTEES") by the subsidiaries of the Company listed in Schedule II hereto that have signed this Agreement (each, a "GUARANTOR" and, collectively, the "GUARANTORS"), and will be issued pursuant to the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto (as so supplemented, the "INDENTURE"), each to be dated as of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), among the Company, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York, as trustee (in such capacity, the "TRUSTEE"). If you are the only Underwriter, all references herein to the Representative shall be deemed to be to the Underwriter. 1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE GUARANTORS. The Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-54030), filed on January 19, 2001, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, filed on January 29, 2001 (the "2001 REGISTRATION STATEMENT") and a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-75068), filed on December 13, 2001, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, filed on February 11, 2002 (the "2002 REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), for the registration of the Company's debt and other securities, as described therein, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission
(the "RULES AND REGULATIONS") under the Securities Act. Such registration statements, as so amended, have been declared effective by the Commission and copies have heretofore been delivered to the Underwriters. The 2001 Registration Statement and the 2002 Registration Statement, as so amended, including all information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, are collectively referred to herein as the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT." No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the Commission. The Company will file the Prospectus (as defined below) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations. The base prospectus contained in the 2001 Registration Statement and the base prospectus contained in the 2002 Registration Statement, at the time each such registration statement was declared effective, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering and sale of the Notes (the "OFFERING"), in the form in which it is to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "PROSPECTUS," except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the Offering which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations), the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use. Any preliminary prospectus supplement (and the related base prospectus) relating to the Offering filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations is hereafter called the "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), on or before the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include (i) the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, which is incorporated therein by reference and (ii) any such document so filed. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"). (b) At the time of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 of the Rules and Regulations, when any supplement to or amendment of the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, when any document filed under the Exchange Act is filed and at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the 2
Rules and Regulations thereunder and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not and will not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus, or the Preliminary Prospectus, if any, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When a related Preliminary Prospectus, if any, was first filed with the Commission (whether filed as part of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the Rules and Regulations) and when any amendment thereof or supplement thereto was first filed with the Commission, such Preliminary Prospectus, if any, and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the respective Rules and Regulations thereunder and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No representation and warranty is made in this subsection (b), however, with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or related Preliminary Prospectus, if any, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you specifically for use therein ("UNDERWRITERS' INFORMATION"). The parties acknowledge and agree that the Underwriters' Information consists solely of the material included in the third and fifth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the prospectus supplement portion of the Prospectus. (c) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as set forth in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the business, prospects, properties, operations, condition (financial or other) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, and since the date of the latest balance sheet presented in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred or undertaken any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, which are material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for liabilities or obligations which are reflected in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (d) The conditions for use of Form S-3, as set forth in the General Instructions thereto, have been satisfied. (e) The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto become effective and at the Closing Date (as hereinafter 3
defined), will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (f) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has been duly incorporated or formed, is validly existing as a corporation, limited liability company or Massachusetts statutory business trust in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is currently being conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties, and each is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or statutory business trust authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect (financial or otherwise) on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"). (g) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Company's subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; all of such capital stock or other ownership interests (in the case of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries) or all of such capital stock or other ownership interests that the Company owns (in the case of less than wholly-owned subsidiaries as disclosed in the Prospectus or Schedule III hereto) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, in each case, free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien, encumbrance or adverse claim of any nature, except as disclosed in the Prospectus or such as are not material to the business prospects, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and Schedule III hereto sets forth the Company's ownership interest in any subsidiary (as defined in Regulation S-X Rule 1-02(n) of the Rules and Regulations) that is less than wholly-owned. (h) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantors and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantors enforceable in accordance with its terms except as (i) rights to indemnity and contribution hereunder may be limited by applicable law, (ii) the enforceability hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (iii) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability. (i) The Notes have been duly and validly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement, each Guarantee has been duly and validly authorized by the Guarantor to which it relates and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to the Underwriters against payment therefor as provided by this Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, 4
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability. (j) The Indenture has been duly and validly authorized by the Company and each of the Guarantors and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and when executed and delivered by the Company and each of the Guarantors, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, will be a valid and binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability. The Indenture will conform and any amendment or supplement thereto will conform with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. (k) The Notes and Guarantees conform as to legal matters to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. (l) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its respective charter or by-laws or comparable organizational documents or in default (and no condition exists which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) in the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note or any other evidence of indebtedness or in any other agreement, indenture or instrument material to the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective property is bound except for such defaults as could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. (m) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with all the provisions hereof and thereof, as the case may be, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body (except as such may be required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states or jurisdictions outside the United States), and will not conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or a default under, the charter or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective property is bound, or violate or conflict with any laws, administrative regulations or rulings or court decrees applicable to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective property. (n) Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, there are no material legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its 5
subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their respective property is the subject, and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated. (o) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently in violation of any foreign, federal, state or local law or regulation relating to the protection of human health or safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), nor any federal or state law relating to discrimination in the hiring, promotion or pay of employees nor any applicable federal or state wages and hours laws, nor any provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which singly, or in the aggregate, could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (p) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has such permits, licenses, franchises and authorizations of governmental or regulatory authorities ("PERMITS") including, without limitation, under any applicable Environmental Laws, as are necessary to own, lease and operate its respective properties and to conduct its respective business, except to the extent that the failure to have such Permits would not singly, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; the Company and each of its subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all of its material obligations with respect to such Permits and no event has occurred which has or after notice or lapse of time would singly, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, except as described in the Prospectus, such Permits contain no restrictions that materially interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as currently conducted. (q) In the ordinary course of its business, when the Company or any of its subsidiaries acquires a fee interest in a parcel of real property located in the United States, the Company conducts a review of the property (generally consisting of a Phase I environmental assessment or similar study prepared on behalf of the seller or a predecessor owner of such property) to determine whether any conditions exist on the property that would constitute a violation of Environmental Laws or would require a material amount of capital or operating expenditures for clean-up, closure or compliance with Environmental Laws. In the ordinary course of its business, when the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into a long-term real property lease for property located in the United States, the Company conducts an internal review, which may or may not result in a Phase I environmental assessment or similar study (although the Company would typically obtain a Phase I or similar study where the Company would have the right to acquire a fee interest in such real property), as it relates to such real property to determine whether any conditions exist on the property that would constitute a violation of Environmental Laws or would require a material amount of capital or operating expenditures for clean-up, closure or compliance with Environmental Laws. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company utilizes local counsel to obtain advice regarding owned or leased real property and local environmental matters outside the United States. On the basis of such reviews and advice, the Company has concluded that 6
such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (r) Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus or such as are not material to the business prospects, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company and each of its subsidiaries has good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and restrictions except liens for taxes not yet due and payable, to all property and assets described in the Prospectus as being owned by it. All leases to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party are valid and binding and no default by the Company of any of its subsidiaries, by any other party, has occurred or is continuing thereunder, which might result singly, or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect to the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the Company and its subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases to which any of them is a party as lessee with such exceptions as do not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (s) The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintains, with insurers of recognized standing, reasonably adequate insurance against property and casualty loss, general liability, business interruption and such other losses and risks, in each case, in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the business in which they are engaged. (t) Arthur Andersen LLP, who certified certain consolidated financial statements and supporting schedules of the Company, were independent public accountants as required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the respective Rules and Regulations thereunder. (u) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who are the current auditors of the Company and RSM Robson Rhodes, who have certified certain financial statements of Iron Mountain Europe Limited, each are independent public accountants as required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the respective Rules and Regulations thereunder. (v) The financial statements, together with related schedules and notes forming part of the Prospectus (and any amendment or supplement thereto), present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries on the basis stated in the Prospectus at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they apply; such statements and related schedules and notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed therein; and the other financial and statistical information and data set forth in the Prospectus (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is, to the Company's knowledge, in all material respects, accurately presented and prepared on a basis reasonably consistent with the books and records of the Company. 7
(w) Based on the knowledge of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company, (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002 (each a "Report", and collectively, the "Reports"), fully comply with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (ii) the information contained in each Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the date of filing with the Commission. (x) The pro forma financial statements and other pro forma financial information (including the notes thereto) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus (i) present fairly the information shown therein, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and the related Rules and Regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to pro forma financial statements and (iii) have been properly compiled on the basis described therein, and the assumptions used in the preparation of such pro forma financial statements and other pro forma financial information (including the notes thereto) are reasonable and the adjustments used therein are appropriate to give effect to the transactions or circumstances referred to therein. (y) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes) will not violate or result in a violation of Section 7 of the Exchange Act, or any Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

which is designed to or which constitutes or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes and neither the Company nor any of its affiliated purchasers (as defined in Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act) will take any action prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

(a) Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or related Preliminary Prospectus, if any, or the Prospectus, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have including under this Agreement. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the directors of the Company, each of the officers of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages 17
and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or related Preliminary Prospectus, if any, or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein. This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have including under this Agreement. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7). In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or reasonably could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such 18
settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or reasonably could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. 8. CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting, in the case of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses suffered by the Company any contribution received by the Company from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company) as incurred to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and (y) the underwriting discount received by the Underwriters bear to the total price to the public of the Notes, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within in the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this 19
Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise. The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint. 9.
