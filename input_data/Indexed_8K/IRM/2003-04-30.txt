Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Stephen P. Golden Director of Investor Relations (617) 535-4799 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports First Quarter 2003 Financial Results o Total Revenues are $352 Million, Up 11% o Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Items is $0.25 per Diluted Share o Operating Income is $72 Million, Up 26% o EBITDA Reaches $104 Million, Up 30% Boston, MA - April 30, 2003 - Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today reported higher revenues, EBITDA and earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The Company also reported that it generated $72 million of operating income, an increase of 26% over the first quarter of 2002. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 grew to $352 million, an increase of 11% compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2002. Storage revenues increased to $203 million for the first quarter from $183 million for the same period in 2002. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 57th consecutive quarter for which Iron Mountain has reported increased storage revenues. For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, total internal revenue growth was 8%. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "The Company posted solid results for the first quarter--revenues were within expectations and our margins were exceptionally strong. Storage growth rates remained stable however, service revenue growth rates, particularly for complementary services were down from last year's levels. As planned, we are increasing our investment in our sales and sales support resources, particularly in the digital services and enterprise solutions and services arenas to take advantage of emerging market opportunities." EBITDA (earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $104 million, or 29.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 compared to $80 million, or 25.2% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2002. Operating income for the first quarter of 2003 was $72 million, or 20.5% of revenues, compared to $57 million, or 18.0% of revenues, for the same period in 2002. Iron Mountain believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is an important financial measure used in evaluating the Company's performance, as EBITDA is an internally generated source of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness. Internally, Iron Mountain uses EBITDA as the basis for evaluating the performance of and allocating resources to its operating segments. Externally, holders of the Company's publicly issued debt use EBITDA and EBITDA-based calculations as important criteria for evaluating the Company and, as a result, all of its bond indentures and covenants include EBITDA and EBITDA-based calculations as primary measures of financial performance. However, EBITDA is subject to foreign currency fluctuations and, under new accounting rules, debt extinguishment charges. As a result, operating income, which is less affected by these items, is emerging as an important measure of the Company's financial performance. -- more --
Iron Mountain Reports First Quarter 2003 Financial Results / Page 2 Below is a reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA: Other (Income) Expense, net for the first quarter of 2003 is comprised of a $5 million foreign currency gain, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a $2 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the Company's 9-1/8% notes. The Company expects to record a charge of approximately $14 million in the second quarter ending June 30, 2003, for the early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the Company's 8-3/4% notes. Other (Income) Expense, net for the first quarter of 2002 is comprised primarily of a $1 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of the Company's revolving credit facility. Income from continuing operations before extraordinary items was $21 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003, compared to $13 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Net Income for the first quarter of 2003 was $21 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company completed the redemption of its 9-1/8% notes by retiring the $23 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding at year-end. The Company also exchanged $31 million of its 7-3/4% notes for $30 million of its outstanding 8-3/4% notes. In April 2003, the Company sold $300 million of its 7-3/4% notes at 104.0% of par, which implies an effective yield to worst of 7.066%. The net proceeds to the Company of $307 million will be used to fund the Company's offer to purchase and consent solicitation for its 8-3/4% notes, or to otherwise redeem the 8-3/4% notes, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, the possible repayment of other indebtedness and possible future acquisitions. Iron Mountain completed 3 acquisitions since the end of 2002 serving markets in France, Texas and Louisiana. These acquisitions were announced in the Company's fourth quarter 2002 earnings release and were included in the 2003 guidance at that time. -- more --
