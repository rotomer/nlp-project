IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED (Registrant) By: /s/ Jean A. Bua ------------------------------------------ Name: Jean A. Bua Title: Vice President and Corporate Controller Date: October 29, 2003

Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports Third Quarter 2003 Financial Results * Total Revenues are $382 Million; Up 15% * Operating Income is $77 Million; Up 17% * Net Income is $0.17 per Diluted Share * Company Reaffirms 2003 Full Year Guidance BOSTON, Oct. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today reported higher revenues and operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. In addition, the Company reaffirmed its previously released guidance for the full year 2003. Net Income is $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 grew to $382 million, an increase of 15% compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2002. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 17% and service revenues grew 12% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 59th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the third quarter of 2003, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 2%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 6%. The storage internal growth rate continued its upward trend and core service revenues, at 9%, grew in line with storage growth. Overall service revenue growth was impacted by a decline in complementary service revenues primarily in the Company's North American business units. The Company experienced lower levels of special projects and product sales, most notably data product sales, compared with the same periods in 2002. The year over year comparison of complementary service revenues was made more difficult by the particularly strong service revenues reported in the third quarter of 2002. The Company believes that service revenues will likely grow at a slower rate than storage revenues for the balance of the year due to continued lower growth rates in complementary services. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "The Company continued to report solid results for the third quarter with both revenue and operating income at or above the top end of our guidance. Storage internal growth rates continued to tick up, margins expanded and we continued to generate free cash flow before acquisitions and investments on a year-to-date basis. As we anticipated, we saw slower internal growth rates in certain complementary service lines. In Europe, our integration of the Hays IMS acquisition is proceeding as planned and here in the U.S., we continued to expand our secure shredding footprint via acquisitions and Greenfield start-up operations." Today's earnings announcement introduces a non-GAAP measure, operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, which the Company will report going forward as one of its key financial metrics. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is the metric that most closely resembles what the Company has historically referred to as Adjusted EBITDA. Currently, the only difference between the two metrics is the inclusion in OIBDA of gains and losses on the disposal or write-downs of property, plant and equipment, net. Prior to 2003, other charges such as merger-related expenses and stock compensation expense had been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA as well. The Company believes that operating income before depreciation and amortization is useful because it is an important financial measure used in evaluating the Company's performance, as it is an internally generated source of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness. Holders of the Company's publicly issued debt use OIBDA-based calculations, referred to as Adjusted EBITDA, as important criteria for evaluating the Company. As a result, all of its bond indentures and covenants include OIBDA- based calculations, called Adjusted EBITDA, as primary measures of financial performance. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income to Net Income appears later in this press release. Operating income before depreciation and amortization was $110 million, or 28.9% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 compared to $95 million, or 28.5% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Operating income for the third quarter of 2003 was $77 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $66 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2002. Net income for the quarter was $15 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $16 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Included in net income for 2003 is $10 million of other expense, net comprised of a $5 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to the partial redemption of the 8-1/8% senior notes of the Company's subsidiary, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, and a $5 million foreign currency related net loss. The loss is due primarily to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar in the third quarter. Gains related to the strengthening of the pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar were offset by our hedging activities related to that currency. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1,093 million, an increase of 12% with storage revenues growing at 13% and service revenues growing at 10% compared to the prior year. For the nine-month period, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 4%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. OIBDA was $312 million, or 28.6% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 compared to $266 million, or 27.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. Operating income for the first nine months of 2003 was $218 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $186 million, or 19% of revenues, for the same period in 2002. Net income from continuing operations before extraordinary items was $56 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2003, compared to $48 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Included in income from continuing operations before extraordinary items for the first nine months of 2003 is $2 million of other expense, net comprised of a $19 million foreign currency gain, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and the pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar, which was more than offset by $21 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. Included in income from continuing operations before extraordinary items for the first nine months of 2002 is $2 million of other income, net comprised primarily of a $4 million foreign currency gain partially offset by $1 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2002 refinancing activities. Net Income for the first nine months of 2003 was $56 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to $42 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Included in net income for 2002 is a $6 million after tax charge representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in the first quarter of 2002 related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Company's investment in South America.
