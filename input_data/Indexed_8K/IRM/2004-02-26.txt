Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports 2003 Financial Results -- Total Revenues Exceed $1.5 Billion, Up 14% -- Operating Income is $305 Million, Up 21% -- Net Income is $0.98 per Diluted Share -- Company Generates $83 Million of Free Cash Flow Before Acquisitions and Investments -- Company Doubles Size of European Operations with Hays IMS Acquisition BOSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/-- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total revenues exceeded $1.5 billion and operating income surpassed $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 marking the 10th consecutive year for which the Company has reported both higher revenues and operating income. The Company also reported net income of $0.98 per diluted share and $83 million of free cash flow before acquisitions and investments for the year. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "2003 was another solid year for Iron Mountain. Our revenues exceeded $1.5 billion for the first time in our history and we doubled our presence in Europe with the strategic acquisition of Hays. We drove increased profitability by mining efficiencies in our operations, which enabled us to further invest in sales and marketing and information technology systems to support our continued growth. As a result, the free cash flow story continued to unfold as predicted. Today, we see tremendous opportunities before us and we are focusing our efforts on aligning the organization to capture these opportunities." Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 grew to $1,501 million, an increase of 14% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year, storage revenues grew 15% and service revenues grew 12% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 60th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased quarterly storage revenues. For 2003, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 3%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 6%. The storage internal growth rate of 8% matched the growth rate of 2002. Core service revenues continued to grow ahead of storage revenues, and combined, they yielded a total core revenue growth rate of 9%. As expected, overall service revenue growth was impacted by a decline in complementary service revenues primarily in the Company's North American business units. The Company experienced lower levels of special projects and product sales, most notably data product sales, compared with 2002. Operating income for 2003 was $305 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $253 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") increased 21% to $436 million, or 29.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $362 million, or 27.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in operating income, OIBDA and OIBDA margin for 2003 was due to an increase in gross margin, resulting primarily from improved labor management, lower annual incentive compensation expense and reduced bad debt expense. Due to the success of the centralized collection efforts over the past two years and the resulting improvements to the accounts receivable aging, the Company was able to significantly reduce its reserve for doubtful accounts in 2003. The Company uses OIBDA, an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income to Net Income appears later in this press release. Net income for the year was $85 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $58 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for 2002. Included in net income for 2003 is $3 million of other income, net comprised of a $30 million foreign currency gain, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling against the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by $28 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. Included in net income for 2002 is $1 million of other expense, net comprised primarily of a $5 million foreign currency gain, which was offset by $5 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2002 refinancing activities. Also included in net income for 2002 is a $6 million charge representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in the first quarter of 2002 related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Company's investment in South America. Company Generates $83 Million of Cash Flow Before Acquisitions and Investments Cash flows from operating activities grew to $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 13% compared to 2002. This growth in cash flows from operating activities combined with a much more modest increase in net capital expenditures enabled the Company to generate $83 million of free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, an increase of 47% compared to 2002. 2002 2003 (Dollars in Millions) Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $255 $289 Less: Capital Expenditures, net 190 193 Customer Acquisition Costs 8 13 Free Cash Flow Before Acquisitions and Investments $57 $83 Cash Paid for Acquisitions and Investments, net $49 $381 As previously reported, Iron Mountain acquired the U.S. and European records management business of Hays plc in July 2003 for approximately $333 million. This transaction effectively doubled the size of Iron Mountain Europe Ltd ("IME"), the Company's 50.1% owned European joint venture, both in the U.K. and Continental Europe. The Hays integration is proceeding as expected and IME continues to perform well. In addition, the Company expects to complete the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME from Mentmore plc, for total consideration of approximately $154 million in cash, by the end of February 2004. This transaction will give Iron Mountain 100% ownership of IME, affording it full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. The Company was very active in the high-yield debt market in 2003, as it took full advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to refinance several of its higher interest rate notes. Beginning in November 2002 and continuing through 2003, the Company closed four high-yield transactions and refinanced $485 million of high-yield debt. Primarily as a result of these transactions and lower variable interest rates, the Company was able to reduce its weighted average interest rate from 8.3% at December 31, 2002 to 7.7% at December 31, 2003. In 2004, the Company successfully completed its first sterling denominated high-yield offering raising GBP 150 million ($275 million) at an interest rate of 7.25%. Proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to fund the acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME. In addition, the Company called the remaining $20 million of Iron Mountain Canada Corporation's 8.125% Senior Notes due 2008 and will record a charge of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2004 related to this transaction.
