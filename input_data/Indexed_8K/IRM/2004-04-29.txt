Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports First Quarter 2004 Financial Results -- Total Revenues are $434 Million, Up 23% -- Operating Income is $86 Million, Up 19% -- Net Income is $0.26 per Diluted Share -- Company Wins 2004 IR Magazine Award for Best Disclosure Policy BOSTON, April 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Total revenues were $434 million, operating income was $86 million and net income was $23 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The Company also reported operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") of $123 million for the first quarter of 2004. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "The business performed well in the first quarter. Revenue grew 23%, primarily driven by improved internal growth and acquisitions. We continue to gain traction in our digital business as market acceptance begins to translate into revenue. In Europe, we established ourselves as the leader in the important German market with our acquisition of DISOS in March. 2004 is off to a solid start and we are optimistic about achieving our financial objectives for the full year." Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 grew to $434 million, an increase of 23% compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2003. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 23% and service revenues grew 24% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 61st consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased quarterly storage revenues. For the first quarter of 2004, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 6%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 8%. The storage internal growth rate of 8% is in line with the quarterly storage growth rates of 2002 and 2003. Core service revenues continued to improve due primarily to increases in the Off-Site Data Protection division and the Secure Shredding product line. Total core revenue growth for the quarter was 9%. Complementary service revenues improved in the first quarter of 2004, due primarily to increased carton sales in the US and a solid quarter in the Company's fulfillment business and were flat compared to the first quarter of 2003 on a same store basis. Operating income for the first quarter of 2004 was $86 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $72 million, or 21% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 20% to $123 million, or 28.4% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 from $102 million, or 29.0% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Included in both operating income and OIBDA is a $2 million net gain on the disposal of fixed assets recorded in the first quarter of 2003 that was not repeated in 2004. The Company uses OIBDA, an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income to Net Income appears later in this press release. Net income for the quarter was $23 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $21 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for 2003. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2004 is $2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost entirely of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2003 is $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of a $5 million foreign currency gain, which was offset by $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 first quarter refinancing activities. The Company expects to record a modest charge of less than $1 million related to the refinancing of its senior credit facility in the second quarter of 2004. Following is a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income to net income (in millions): Quarter ended March 31, 2003 2004 OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) (1) $102 $123 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 30 37 Operating Income (1) $72 $86 Less: Interest Expense, net 36 43 Other (Income) Expense, net (3) 2 Provision for Income Taxes 17 17 Minority Interest 1 1 Net Income (1) $21 $23 Major Components of Other (Income) Expense, net: Foreign Exchange Effects $(5) $-- Debt Extinguishment Charges $2 $2 (1) Includes a $2 million Gain on Disposal/Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the first quarter of 2003. As previously reported, Iron Mountain acquired the remaining 49.9% equity interest in Iron Mountain Europe Limited ("IME") from Mentmore plc, for total consideration of approximately $154 million in cash, including the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. This transaction gives Iron Mountain 100% ownership of IME, affording it full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. Other acquisitions completed in 2004, include 3 records management businesses in Europe, 1 in Chile, 2 secure shredding businesses, a film and sound business and an intellectual property protection business specializing in domain name management. The Company was active in both the high-yield debt market and the senior credit market here in the US as well as in Europe during the first quarter of 2004. The Company successfully completed its first sterling denominated high- yield offering raising GBP 150 million ($274 million) at an interest rate of 7.25%. Proceeds from this transaction were used primarily to fund the acquisition of Mentmore's 49.9% equity interest in IME. In addition, the Company called the remaining $20 million of Iron Mountain Canada Corporation's 8.125% Senior Notes due 2008. In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries closed a GBP 200 million senior credit facility comprised of a GBP 100 million revolving credit facility and a GBP 100 million term loan. The initial draw under this facility was used primarily to repay GBP 135 million of the bridge financing provided by Iron Mountain Incorporated to IME in connection with the Hays acquisition in July 2003. The Company used these funds primarily to repay certain real estate term loans, cross currency swaps and outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. In April 2004, the Company refinanced its own senior credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in January 2005, with a $550 million senior credit facility comprised of a $350 million revolving credit facility and a $200 million term loan. As of March 31, the Company's weighted average interest rate was 7.8% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 9 years. The Company remains more than 85% fixed with respect to interest rates.
