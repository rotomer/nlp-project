Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports Second Quarter 2004 Financial Results * Total Revenues are $445 Million, Up 24% * Operating Income is $87 Million; Up 27% * Net Income is $0.17 per Diluted Share * Shredding Line Expanded in Canada with Acquisition of Proshred Security International, Inc. BOSTON, July 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today reported higher revenues and operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $0.17 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 grew to $445 million, an increase of 24% compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2003. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 22% and service revenues grew 26% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 62nd consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the second quarter of 2004, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 4%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. The storage internal growth rate continued to trend up as strong growth in the Company's digital services and certain international markets enhanced the solid growth rates posted by the core North American business units. Core services, led by Secure Shredding, grew at a rate of 7% compared to 2003 and complementary services were roughly flat to last year's levels due primarily to the absence of large special projects and lower product sales. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "The business is generally performing in line with our expectations. As with any portfolio of businesses and services, some performed better than others and we continue to be pleased with our newer investments in growth opportunities across geographies, such as Europe and Latin America, and service lines, such as secure shredding and digital services, all of which performed very well in the quarter." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $127 million, or 28.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 compared to $99 million, or 27.7% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the second quarter of 2004 was $87 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $69 million, or 19% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Net income for the quarter was $23 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $20 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2004 is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses due to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar in the second quarter. The net effect of the exchange rate fluctuations relative to the British Pound Sterling was less than $0.5 million due primarily to the implementation of our hedging strategy relative to that currency. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2003 is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of a $19 million foreign currency gain, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar partially offset by $14 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $879 million, an increase of 24% with storage revenues growing at 22% and service revenues growing at 25% compared to the prior year. For the six-month period, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 5%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. OIBDA was $250 million, or 28.5% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to $202 million, or 28.4% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Operating income for the first six months of 2004 was $173 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $141 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Net income was $46 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2004, compared to $41 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. Included in net income for the first six months of 2004 is $7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised of a $5 million foreign currency loss, due primarily to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar, and $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. Included in net income for the first six months of 2003 is $8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of a $24 million foreign currency gain, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and the British pound sterling partially offset by $16 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. Iron Mountain continued its acquisition strategy, opportunistically buying attractive businesses expanding its geographical footprint and records management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations providing the platform for future growth. Since the end of the first quarter of 2004, the Company has completed 13 acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $106 million. These acquisitions have expanded the Company's operations in important international markets (Germany, Chile), strengthened the Company's secure shredding business in Canada, California, Texas and Oregon, and opened secondary markets in Tennessee, Maryland and North Carolina. The Company also broadened its intellectual property protection business with the addition of domain name management services.

As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2003 2004 2003 2004 OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) (1) $99 $127 $202 $250 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 30 40 61 78 Operating Income (1) $69 $87 $141 $172 Less: Interest Expense, net 37 43 72 86 Other (Income) Expense, net (5) 5 (8) 7 Provision for Income Taxes 15 16 33 32 Minority Interest 2 -- 3 1 Net Income (1) $20 $23 $41 $46 Major Components of Other (Income) Expense, net: Foreign Exchange Effects $(19) $5 $(24) $5 Debt Extinguishment Charges $14 $-- $16 $2 (1) Includes $2 million of losses and $1 million of gains on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the quarters ended June 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively and a $1 million gain on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
