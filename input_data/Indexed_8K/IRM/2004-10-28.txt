Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports Third Quarter 2004 Financial Results * Total Revenues are $459 Million, Up 20% * Operating Income is $85 Million; Up 10% * Net Income is $0.14 per Diluted Share * Shredding, Digital Services Contributing to Revenue Growth * Acquisition of Connected Corporation Expected to Close in Early November BOSTON, Oct. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today reported higher revenues and operating income for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $0.14 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 grew to $459 million, an increase of 20% compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2003. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 18% and service revenues grew 23% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 63rd consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the third quarter of 2004, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 5%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Iron Mountain is making important strides strategically in what has been a very active 2004. We have become the largest North American provider of integrated shredding services, we have consolidated ownership of important international businesses, and we are starting to see good progress in our digital services business. Operationally, our businesses performed as we expected this quarter, with the exception of our U.S. paper-based Records Management business, where margins were lower than anticipated. We have taken steps intended to return these margins to their normal levels. Our growing investment in our sales and marketing organization, while dampening near-term margins, is beginning to pay dividends." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $127 million, or 27.7% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 compared to $110 million, or 28.9% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the third quarter of 2004 was $85 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $77 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Net income for the quarter was $18 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, an increase of 25% from $15 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004. Included in net income for the third quarter of 2004 is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains due to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar, which were partially offset by net losses due to the weakening of the Euro. The net effect of the exchange rate fluctuations relative to the British Pound Sterling was less than $0.2 million due primarily to the implementation of the Company's hedging strategy relative to that currency. Included in net income for the third quarter of 2003 is $10 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of $5 million of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and $5 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.34 billion, an increase of 22%, with storage revenues growing at 21% and service revenues growing at 25% compared to the prior year. For the nine-month period, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 5%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. OIBDA was $377 million, or 28.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared to $312 million, or 28.6% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. Operating income for the first nine months of 2004 was $258 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $218 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Net income was $64 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2004, compared to $56 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. Included in net income for the first nine months of 2004 is $4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised of a $2 million foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling, and $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. Included in net income for the first nine months of 2003 is $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of a $19 million foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar offset by $21 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain continued to make selected acquisitions, opportunistically buying attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographical footprint and information management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of July, the Company has completed six acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $19 million in cash. These acquisitions have expanded the Company's operations in important international markets (Eastern Europe, Brazil), strengthened the Company's secure shredding business in California and Virginia and enhanced its records management presence in California. In addition, the Company announced on October 12, 2004, the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Framingham, MA-based Connected Corporation in a cash transaction valued at approximately $117 million. The acquisition builds on Iron Mountain's mission to protect its customers' information and to protect its customers through compliant information management. Connected Corporation is a technology and market leader in the protection, archiving and recovery of distributed data. The transaction is expected to close in early November.

As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Nine Months Ended Ended September 30, September 30, 2003 2004 2003 2004 OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) (1) $110 $127 $312 $378 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 33 42 94 120 Operating Income (1) $77 $85 $218 $258 Less: Interest Expense, net 39 54 111 140 Other (Income) Expense, net 10 (3) 2 4 Provision for Income Taxes 12 14 45 47 Minority Interest 1 1 4 2 Net Income (1) (2) $15 $18 $56 $64 Major Components of Other (Income) Expense, net: Foreign Exchange Effects $5 $(3) $(19) $2 Debt Extinguishment Charges $5 $-- $21 $2 (1) Includes $2 million and $1 million of losses on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the quarters ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively and $2 million of losses and $1 million of gains on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
