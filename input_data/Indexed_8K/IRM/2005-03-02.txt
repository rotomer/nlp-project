Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS * Total Revenues are $479 Million, Up 17% * Operating Income is $87 Million * OIBDA is $131 Million; 27.3% of Revenues * Net Income is $0.23 per Diluted Share BOSTON, March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records and information management services, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 and reported higher revenues, operating income and OIBDA for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $0.23 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 grew to $479 million, an increase of 17% compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2003. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 15% and service revenues grew 21% compared to the same period in 2003. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 64th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2004, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 9%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "2004 was an important year for Iron Mountain. Financially we ended the year within or above all of our target ranges and strategically we made major strides in all of our major growth initiatives. We established ourselves as the largest North American provider of integrated shredding services, consolidated ownership of important international businesses in Europe and Latin America and, with the acquisition of Connected Corp. in November, became the leader in the management and protection of distributed data. In a year of significant expansion and transition, our sales force exceeded production expectations. We have built a tremendous organization, our value proposition is strengthening and our opportunities continue to grow. In 2005, we look forward to even greater effectiveness and efficiency from our selling organization and a sharper focus on execution throughout the entire Company as we profitably capture the tremendous opportunity we see before us." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $131 million, or 27.3% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 compared to $124 million, or 30.3% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $87 million, or 18% of revenues, compared to $87 million, or 21% of revenues, for the same period in 2003. Net income for the quarter was $30 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, an increase of 5% from $28 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004.
Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 is $12 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains due to the strengthening of the Euro and the Canadian Dollar. The net effect of the exchange rate fluctuations relative to the British Pound Sterling was less than $3 million due primarily to the implementation of the Company's hedging strategy relative to that currency. Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of $11 million of foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and the British Pound Sterling, which was partially offset by $7 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.82 billion, an increase of 21%, with storage revenues growing at 19% and service revenues growing at 24% compared to the prior year. For the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 6%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 8%. OIBDA was $508 million, or 28.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $436 million, or 29.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating income for 2004 was $344 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $305 million, or 20% of revenues, for 2003. Net income was $94 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for 2004, compared to $85 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for 2003. Included in net income for 2004 is $8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of $9 million of foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling, the Euro and the Canadian Dollar, which was partially offset by $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. Included in net income for 2003 is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of $30 million of foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar offset by $28 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2003 refinancing activities. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain made selected acquisitions, opportunistically buying attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of November 2004, the Company has completed four secure shredding acquisitions and the purchase of minority interests in two of our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $33 million in cash. The most significant fourth quarter 2004 transaction was the acquisition of Framingham, Massachusetts-based Connected Corporation for total consideration of approximately $109 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition builds on Iron Mountain's mission to protect its customers' information and to protect its customers through compliant information management. Connected Corporation is a technology and market leader in the protection, archiving and recovery of distributed data. The transaction closed in early November.

APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): (1) Includes $1 million of gains and $1 million of losses on Disposal/ Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the quarters ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and $1 million of losses and $1 million of gains on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. (2) Columns may not foot due to rounding. Contact: Stephen P. Golden Director of Investor Relations (617) 535-4799 SOURCE Iron Mountain Incorporated -0- 03/02/2005 /CONTACT: Stephen P.
