Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS -- Total Revenues are $501 Million, Up 16% -- Operating Income is $91 Million -- Net Income is $0.17 per Diluted Share BOSTON, April 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the leader in records management and data protection services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, reporting higher revenues, operating income and OIBDA. Net income for the quarter was $0.17 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 grew to $501 million, an increase of 16% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2004. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 15% and service revenues grew 17% compared to the same period in 2004. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 65th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the first quarter of 2005, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 8% and 3%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 6%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 8% for the quarter. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our business performed well in the first quarter. We exceeded several of our financial targets and the internal growth and margin dynamics played out as we indicated they would. Storage internal growth remained solidly within the 8% to 9% range we have operated in for the past three years and the inclusion of the Hays IMS and Connected acquisitions into our internal growth calculus dampened our internal growth rates, particularly complementary services, as expected." Reese went on to say, "Our margins were as we projected and the business continues to perform as expected." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $136 million, or 27.1% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared to $123 million, or 28.4% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the first quarter of 2005 was $91 million, or 18% of revenues, compared to $86 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2004. Net income for the quarter was $23 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, flat compared to $23 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for- two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2005 is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses due to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. The comparable number for the first quarter of 2004 is $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost entirely of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's first quarter 2004 refinancing activities.
In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain made selected acquisitions, opportunistically buying attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of 2004, the Company has completed five secure shredding acquisitions for approximately $14 million in cash and the purchase of minority interests in two of our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $19 million in cash.

Iron Mountain Incorporated Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Amounts in Thousands) (Unaudited) APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, --------------------------- 2004 2005 ------------ ------------ OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) $ 123 $ 136 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 37 45 Operating Income $ 86 $ 91 Less: Interest Expense, net 43 46 Other Expense, net 2 5 Provision for Income Taxes 17 17 Minority Interest -- -- Net Income (1) $ 23 $ 23 Major Components of Other Expense, net: Foreign Exchange Effects $ -- $ 5 Debt Extinguishment Charges $ 2 $ -- (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
