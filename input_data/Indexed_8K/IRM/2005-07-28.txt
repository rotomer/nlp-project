Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS * Total Revenues are $512 Million, Up 15% * Operating Income is $97 Million * Net Income is $0.19 per Diluted Share BOSTON, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the world's trusted partner for records management and data protection services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, reporting higher revenues, operating income and OIBDA. Net income for the quarter was $0.19 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 grew to $512 million, an increase of 15% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 14% and service revenues grew 16% compared to the same period in 2004. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 66th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the second quarter of 2005, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 6%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 8%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 8% for the quarter. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Iron Mountain posted excellent results in the second quarter as we surpassed all of our financial targets. Internal revenue growth was strong and margins exceeded our expectations. Storage internal growth came in at the high end of our range and we saw improvement in our service internal growth rates. We won a major piece of business for our Digital Archive service that will generate meaningful service revenues in the second half of 2005 and recurring storage revenues for the next several years. As a result, we now expect our digital business to breakeven for 2005." Reese continued, "Based on the strength of our first half performance, we are increasing our guidance for the balance of 2005." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $141 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 compared to $127 million, or 28.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the second quarter of 2005 was $97 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $87 million, or 20% of revenues, for the same period in 2004. Net income for the quarter was $25 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, up 11% compared to $23 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2005 is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses due to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro since March 31, 2005. The comparable number for the second quarter of 2004 is also $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost entirely of foreign currency related net losses.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.01 billion, an increase of 15%, with storage revenues growing at 14% and service revenues growing at 16% compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 5%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. OIBDA was $277 million, or 27.3% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 compared to $250 million, or 28.5% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2004. Operating income for the first half of 2005 was $188 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $173 million, or 20% of revenues, for 2004. Net income was $48 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the first six-months of 2005, compared to $46 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2004. Included in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, is $10 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling, the Euro and the Canadian Dollar. Included in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2004, is $7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of $5 million of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain made selected acquisitions, opportunistically buying attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations. In 2005, the Company has completed seven acquisitions, including five shredding businesses, for approximately $21 million in cash and the purchase of minority interests in two of our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $19 million in cash.

As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
