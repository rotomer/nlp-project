Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
Iron Mountain Incorporated today announced that its Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese, has initiated certain equity transactions in connection with an estate plan. All transactions will be reported timely on a Form 4 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Mr. Reese has informed the Company that he intends to enter into a zero-cost collar arrangement (the "Collar") for up to 650,000 shares of Iron Mountain common stock he currently owns. The Collar is the pairing of protective put options with the simultaneous sale of call options. Mr. Reese chose the Collar to mitigate a portion of the risk on the 650,000 shares, which represent less than 19% of the total number of shares beneficially owned by Mr. Reese. The Iron Mountain Board of Directors approved the use of these derivatives by Mr. Reese for this specific transaction. Mr. Reese recused himself from the Board's consideration of this matter.
 
Under the terms of the Collar, Mr. Reese is expected to sell call options on up to 650,000 shares of his Iron Mountain common stock at a price equal to 135% of a to-be-determined market price (the "Market Price") while simultaneously buying put options on the same number of shares at a price equal to 90% of the Market Price. The value of the call options is equal to that of the put options so no cash will be exchanged. The options come due in approximately three years. During the term of the options, Mr. Reese will pledge the shares subject to those options to secure his delivery obligations. As a result, all voting rights and all dividends paid, if any, will go to the buyer of the call option. If the options expire unexercised, the pledged shares will be released to Mr. Reese with all of their associated rights.
 
Additionally, Mr. Reese transferred ownership of 750,000 shares of Iron Mountain common stock to his wife who in turn transferred those shares to the Reese Family 2005 LLC, a family owned limited liability company ("Reese LLC"). Mr. Reese is the investment manager of the Reese LLC and therefore has control over the sale or distribution of any shares by the LLC, the timing of such sales or distributions, and the use of the proceeds of any such sale or distributions.
