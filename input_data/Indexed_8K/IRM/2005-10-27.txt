Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS - Total Revenues are $526 Million, Up 15% - Operating Income is $102 Million - Net Income is $0.27 per Diluted Share BOSTON, Oct. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the world's trusted partner for records management and data protection services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, reporting higher revenues, operating income and OIBDA. Net income for the quarter was $0.27 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, grew to $526 million, an increase of 15% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2004. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 12% and service revenues grew 18% compared to the same period in 2004. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 67th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the third quarter of 2005, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 12%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 10%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 9% for the quarter. A major data restoration project completed by the digital services business unit added approximately 2% to total internal growth for the quarter. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "The third quarter was another great quarter for Iron Mountain characterized by strong internal revenue growth and operating margins. Storage internal growth remained at the top end of our 8% to 9% range and service revenue growth, bolstered by a significant digital data restoration project, was supported by solid growth rates in our core businesses. We also announced our entry into the Asia/Pacific region with our agreement to acquire the Australia and New Zealand operations of Pickfords Records Management. This is an important step in our strategy as we expand our geographic footprint to provide consistent, high-quality service to our customers on a global basis." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $148 million, or 28.1% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, compared to $127 million, or 27.7% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the third quarter of 2005 was $102 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $85 million, or 19% of revenues, for the same period in 2004. Net income for the quarter was $36 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, up 97% compared to $18 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Included in net income for the third quarter of 2005 is $7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains due to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and the Euro since June 30, 2005. The comparable number for the third quarter of 2004 is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised almost entirely of foreign currency related net gains.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.54 billion, an increase of 15%, with storage revenues growing at 14% and service revenues growing at 17% compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 7%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 8%. OIBDA was $425 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $378 million, or 28.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Operating income for the first nine months of 2005 was $290 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $258 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2004. Net income was $85 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $64 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004. Included in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro offset by the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. Included in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, is $4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of $2 million of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the euro and $2 million of charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's 2004 refinancing activities. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain made selected acquisitions, opportunistically buying attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information management product offerings and enhancing its existing operations. In 2005, the Company has completed 12 acquisitions, including eight shredding businesses and two European records management businesses, for approximately $51 million in cash and the purchase of minority interests in three of our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $20 million in cash. On October 17, 2005, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Australian and New Zealand operations of Pickfords Records Management ("PRM") for cash consideration of approximately A$115 million (US$87 million). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by year end. PRM, a leading records management company based in Melbourne, Australia, serves a customer base of more than 3,000 customers in a variety of sectors including finance, healthcare, and federal and state government. With 30 facilities located in all of Australia's capital cities (Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney) and all the major business centers in New Zealand (Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton and Christchurch), PRM has a truly national footprint in both countries. The company's portfolio of services includes records storage and management, secure shredding, imaging and business process outsourcing.

NOTE: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Iron Mountain Incorporated follow. Iron Mountain Incorporated Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Amounts in Thousands except Per Share Data) (Unaudited)
Iron Mountain Incorporated Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Amounts in Thousands) (Unaudited) APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
