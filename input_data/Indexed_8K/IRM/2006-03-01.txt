Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS - Total Revenues are $2.1 Billion, Up 14% - Operating Income is $387 Million - OIBDA is $574 Million; 27.6% of Revenues - Net Income Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle is $0.86 per Diluted Share BOSTON, March 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2005, reporting higher revenues, operating income and OIBDA. Net income for the year was $0.84 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 grew to $2,078 million, an increase of 14% compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year, storage revenues grew 13% and service revenues grew 16% compared to 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, storage revenues grew to $308 million, an increase of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 68th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 7%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 8%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 8% for the year. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our business has performed very well throughout 2005 and the fourth quarter was no exception. We exceeded our revenue and OIBDA targets and our internal revenue growth rates were at or above the top of our forecasted ranges. We also did very well against our strategic agenda in the fourth quarter with the acquisitions of Pickfords, a premier records management business with excellent national footprints in Australia and New Zealand; Secure Destruction Services, the only national provider of shredding services in the UK; and LiveVault, the leading provider of disk-based online server backup and recovery solutions. We still have a lot of work ahead of us but the opportunity set remains strong and we are well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $574 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $508 million, or 28.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2004. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for 2005 was $387 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $344 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2004. Net income before Cumulative Change in Accounting Principle for the year was $114 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $94 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a dividend, paid on June 30, 2004.
Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation Number 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("ARO"), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." This requires us to record a liability for the present value of the estimated future costs of preparing a facility for exit based on contractual obligations contained in the lease. This relates primarily to the removal of vaults and shredding pits. As a result, a non-cash charge of $3 million, net of tax, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle. This charge reduced earnings by $0.02 per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year 2005. Going forward, the accretion of the associated liability will be recorded as a component of depreciation expense. Also included in net income for 2005 is $6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses. These losses were due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro partially offset by a strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. Included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2004, is $8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain acquires attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information protection and storage service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. In 2005, the Company completed 16 acquisitions for approximately $184 million in cash and the purchase of minority interests in three of our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $20 million in cash. The most significant acquisitions completed in 2005 include: (i) the Australian and New Zealand operations of Pickfords Records Management, a premier records management company based in Melbourne, Australia, with operations in all of Australia's capital cities (Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney) and all the major business centers in New Zealand (Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton and Christchurch); and (ii) LiveVault, a leading provider of disk-based online server backup and recovery solutions. Completed after the end of their fiscal year and not included in our 2005 results of operations is Iron Mountain Europe's acquisition of Secure Destruction Services Ltd., the largest shredding business in the UK. Secure Destruction is based in London with seven operating centers and more than 200 employees located throughout the UK. For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $538 million, an increase of 12%, with storage revenues growing at 12% and service revenues growing at 13% compared to the same period in 2004. For the quarter, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 10% and 9%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%. OIBDA was $149 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared to $131 million, or 27.3% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $97 million, or 18% of revenues, compared to $87 million, or 18% of revenues, for 2004. Net income before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle for the quarter was $29 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for 2005, compared to $30 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Also included in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses due to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro since September 30, 2005. The comparable amount for the fourth quarter of 2004 is $12 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised almost entirely of foreign currency related net gains.

APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding. Contact: Stephen P.
