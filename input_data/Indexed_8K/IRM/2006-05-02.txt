Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS - Total Revenues are $564 Million, Up 12% - Operating Income is $92 Million - OIBDA is $142 Million; 25.2% of Revenues - Net Income is $0.20 per Diluted Share BOSTON, May 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, reporting higher revenues, strong internal revenue growth and net income for the quarter of $0.20 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 grew to $564 million, an increase of 12% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2005. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 12% and service revenues grew 13% compared to the same period in 2005. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 69th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the first quarter of 2006, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 10% and 8%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 10%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was also 10% for the quarter. Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our business is performing well led by strong revenue growth across all segments of our business. We have accelerated our investment in overhead spending to expand our position in the market for information protection and storage services, which is impacting our near-term margins. The investments we are making today will further enhance our ability to capture the tremendous market opportunity we see before us." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $142 million, or 25.2% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared to $136 million, or 27.1% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the first quarter of 2006 was $92 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $91 million, or 18% of revenues, for the same period in 2005. Net income for the quarter was $27 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $23 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Included in net income for the quarter is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised of foreign currency related and other non-operating net gains. The foreign currency related gains were due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro partially offset by a weakening of the Australian Dollar compared to December 31, 2005. Included in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain acquires attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information protection and storage service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. Since year end, the Company has completed three acquisitions, the buyout of minority interests in France and Mexico and the acquisition of a minority position in an information protection and storage business in Poland.

APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, ------------ ------------ 2005 2006 ------------ ------------ OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) (1) $ 136 $ 142 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 45 50 Operating Income (1) $ 91 $ 92 Less: Interest Expense, net 46 47 Other (Income) Expense, net 5 (3) Provision for Income Taxes 17 21 Minority Interest 1 -- Net Income (1) $ 23 $ 27 Major Components of Other (Income) Expense, net: Foreign Exchange Effects $ 5 $ (1) (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
