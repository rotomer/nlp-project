Kenny, Jr. has been appointed to the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Corporate Development. Mr. Kenny will continue to serve as a director on the Company's Board, a position he has held since 2000. The Company has retained an executive search firm to conduct the search for a new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kenny will continue as Chief Financial Officer until his successor is hired, at which time he will assume his new responsibilities. Iron Mountain also announced today that Marc Duale has been named President of Iron Mountain Europe, and Linda Rossetti has joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Human Resources.

Mr. Kenny will continue to report to Richard Reese, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and will work closely with Bob Brennan, President and Chief Operating Officer, and the incoming CFO to drive the Company's overall global business strategy. Mr. Kenny will assume his new responsibilities once a successor has been named. "As we prepare to manage the much larger enterprise we fully expect to become, these Corporate Development activities become increasingly important," said Mr. Reese. "We have a diverse and robust opportunity set and we need to apply our greatest intellectual capital against our largest opportunities. John is uniquely qualified to drive success in these areas and provide strategic counsel to the Company. No one has greater insight into our business and this new position provides the opportunity for John to use these skills and play a larger role in developing our strategic agenda."

In 1997, Mr. Kenny was named EVP and CFO. Since that time, Mr. Kenny has directed an aggressive capital markets program raising more than $3 billion in support of the Company's strategy, overseen an acquisition program that has taken the Company to 170 markets in 27 countries on five continents, and built a global finance organization. "This is an important time in the evolution of Iron Mountain," said Mr. Kenny. "As we expand our leadership position, we need to remain focused on the strategic corporate development activities and capital management decisions that will drive higher returns for our shareholders. I feel this new position plays to my strengths and will allow me to focus my energies on these important growth activities. I am looking forward to this next chapter in my Iron Mountain career."
