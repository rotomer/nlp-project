Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
John F. Kenny, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company"), has initiated certain equity transactions. All transactions have been reported timely on a Form 4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2006.
 
Mr. Kenny entered into a variable forward sale contract (the "Contract") with an unaffiliated third party (the "Counterparty") to mitigate a portion of the risk on up to 80,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the "Common Stock"), which represent approximately 17% of the total number of shares Mr. Kenny beneficially owns. The Company's Board of Directors approved the use of these derivatives by Mr. Kenny for this specific transaction. Mr. Kenny recused himself from the board's consideration of this matter.
 
The Contract obligates Mr. Kenny to deliver to the Counterparty up to 80,000 shares of Common Stock or, if he so elects, an equivalent amount of cash ("Cash Settlement") in exchange for $2,582,832 on the maturity date of April 6, 2010 (the "Maturity Date"). The amount of shares Mr. Kenny will be obligated to deliver will be based on the price per share of the Common Stock on the Maturity Date relative to a floor price of 90% of the average market price as determined during the execution of the Contract and a cap of 149% of such average market price. Mr. Kenny pledged 80,000 shares of the Common Stock to secure his obligation under the Contract. For additional details regarding this transaction, please refer to the aforementioned Form 4.
