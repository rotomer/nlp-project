2004 Indenture
"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors named therein and the BONY, as trustee, as Exhibit 4 and incorporates the 2004 Indenture herein by reference.
Additional Risk Factor
 
The Company hereby adds the following risk factor to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" under the heading "Operational Risks" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005:
 
Governmental focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, our failure to protect our customers' confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.
 
In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, many states have adopted breach of data security statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. In addition, Congress is considering several bills that are intended to address data security, including by requiring notification to affected persons of breaches of data security. We presently are cooperating with a federal agency in a non-public inquiry regarding our information security practices, and we may be subject to additional inquiries in the future. As previously reported, we have in the past experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. The increased focus on data security may lead to governmental action and/or changes in customer demand as a result of which we may modify our operations with the goal of further improving
 
 
 
data security or accept increased liabilities or obligations if breaches of data security occur with respect to data in our custody. However, we may be unable to increase our rates sufficiently to counter our increased expenses due to such modifications in operations or such liabilities and obligations, and that would adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss in the United States or other countries, which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.
 
Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges
The statement of the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2005 and for the three months ended March 31, 2006 is attached hereto as Exhibit 12 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Public Offering and Cash Tender Offer
On July 11, 2006, the Company issued press releases announcing a proposed public offering of $200 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 and announcing that it has commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 8-1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011. Copies of the Company's press releases are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note.
Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
 
30
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.
Section 2.9     Outstanding Notes.
The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest on a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof and those described in this Section as not outstanding.
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.8, it ceases to be outstanding until the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If one or more Paying Agents (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) hold on the maturity date or on any Redemption Date, money sufficient to pay such Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a Guarantor holds the Note.
Section 2.10     Treasury Notes.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, Notes owned by the Company or an Affiliate shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Notes that are to be acquired by the Company, any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or any Guarantor pursuant to an exchange offer, tender offer or other agreement shall not be deemed to be owned by the Company, such Guarantor, a Subsidiary of the Company or such Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or such Guarantor until legal title to such Notes passes to the Company, such Guarantor, such Subsidiary or such Affiliate, as the case may be.
Section 2.11     Temporary Notes.
Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes upon a Company Order. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of definitive Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee upon request shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until so exchanged, temporary Notes shall have the same rights under this Indenture as the definitive Notes.
Section 2.12     Cancellation.
The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall dispose of such canceled Notes (subject to the
 
31
record retention requirement of the Exchange Act) in accordance with the Trustee's customary practice. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.13     Defaulted Interest.
If the Company and the Guarantors default in a payment of interest on the Notes, the Company or any such Guarantor (to the extent of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee) shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be at the earliest practicable date but in all events at least five Business Days prior to the payment date, in each case at the rate provided for with respect to the applicable Notes. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, and shall, promptly thereafter, notify the Trustee of any such date. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Company) shall mail to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid. The Company and the Guarantors may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
Section 2.14     Record Date.
The record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture shall be determined as provided for in TIA  316(c).
Section 2.15     Common Code and ISIN Number.
The Company in issuing the Notes may use a "Common Code" number or an "ISIN" number, and if so, such Common Code and/or ISIN number shall be included in notices of redemption or purchase as a convenience to Holders;
provided
,
however
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the Common Code and/or ISIN number printed in the notice or on the Notes, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and each Agent of any change in the Common Code and/or ISIN number.
Section 2.16     Deposit of Moneys.
Prior to 10:00 am (London time), on each date on which interest is to be paid, the maturity date and each payment date relating to an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer, and on the Business Day immediately following any acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.2, the Company shall deposit with the Principal Paying Agent in immediately available funds money in pounds sterling sufficient to make cash payments, if any, due on such interest payment date, maturity date, or Business Day, as the case may be. Subject to receipt of such funds by such time, the Principal Paying Agent and each Paying Agent shall remit such payment in a timely manner to the Holders on such interest payment date, maturity date or Business Day, as the case may be, to the Persons and in the manner set forth in paragraph 2 of the Notes.
ARTICLE III.

If the Company wants or is obligated to redeem prior to the Stated Maturity thereof all or part of the Notes, it shall notify the Trustee of the redemption date and the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed. The Company shall give the notice at least 45 days before the redemption date (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Trustee), which notice shall be in the form of an Officers' Certificate setting forth (i) the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and (iv) the redemption price.
Section 3.2     Selection of Notes to be Redeemed.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed among the applicable Holders on a
pro rata
basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate,
provided
that no Notes of 75,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in amounts of 75,000 or whole multiples of 1,000 to the extent above 75,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of 75,000, shall be redeemed. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption.
Section 3.3     Notice of Redemption.
At least 10 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of redemption by first-class mail to the Common Depositary, each Depositary and, if any Definitive Registered Notes are outstanding, each Holder, in each case, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company shall also publish the notice of redemption (and, following such notice, will publish the results of such redemption) in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in London (which is expected to be the
Financial Times
) and, so long as the Notes called for redemption are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such Stock Exchange shall so require, a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
Luxemburger Wort
). So long as the Notes called for redemption are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company shall notify, or cause to be notified, such Stock Exchange of each redemption of Notes made pursuant to this Indenture.
The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed (including the Common Code and ISIN numbers, if any) and shall state:
(a)       the redemption date;
(b)       the redemption price (including accrued interest to, but excluding, the redemption date);
(c)      if any Note called for redemption is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note;
 
33
(d)       the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(e)
      
that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; and
(f)
      
that, unless the Company defaults in the making of such redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date.
At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at its expense.
Section 3.4     Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is mailed or published as provided in Section 3.3, Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for called for redemption and all rights of Holders with respect to such Notes will terminate except for the right to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender for redemption. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the redemption price plus accrued interest to but excluding the redemption date.
Section 3.5     Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 10:00 am (London time) on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest, if any, on all Notes to be redeemed on that date. If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding sentence, on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption, whether or not such Notes are presented for payment. If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the first sentence of this paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided with respect to such Note.
Section 3.6     Notes Redeemed in Part.
Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder a new Note and the same maturity equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.
Section 3.7     Optional Redemption.

On and after April 15, 2009, the Notes will be subject to redemption at any time at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption price (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on April 15 of the years indicated below:
 
34
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to April 15, 2007 the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem the Notes at a redemption price of 107.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts if any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Qualified Equity Offerings;
provided that
:
(1)
           
at least 100.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes subsequently issued as part of the same class) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding notes held by the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries); and
(2)
           
the redemption occurs within six months of the date of the closing of any such Qualified Equity Offering.
Section 3.8     Mandatory Redemption.

Section 3.9     Asset Sale Offers.
In the event that the Company shall commence an Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Section 4.17 hereof, it shall follow the procedures specified below:
The Asset Sale Offer shall remain open for 20 Business Days after the Commencement Date relating to such Asset Sale Offer, except to the extent required to be extended by applicable law (as so extended, the "
Offer Period
"). No later than one Business Day after the termination of the Offer Period (the "
Purchase Date
"), the Company shall purchase the principal amount (the "
Offer Amount
") of Notes required to be purchased in such Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 4.17 hereof or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer.
If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any interest accrued to such Purchase Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest shall be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.
On the Commencement Date of any Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall send or cause to be sent, by first class mail, a notice to each of the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable the Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer and shall state:
(1)
           
that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 3.9 and Section 4.17 hereof and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer shall remain open;
 
35
(2)           the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;
(3)
           
that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment shall continue to accrue interest;
(4)
           
that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;
(5)
           
that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Company, a depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Purchase Date;
(6)
           
that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, depositary or Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the close of business on the Business Day preceding the termination of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing such Holder's election to have the Note purchased;
(7)
           
that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased on a
pro rata
basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed to be appropriate by the Company so that (a) only Notes in denominations of 1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased and (b) Holders retain Notes in minimum denominations of 75,000 after such repurchase); and
(8)
           
that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.
On or before 10:00 am (London time) on each Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent in immediately available funds the aggregate purchase price with respect to a principal amount of Notes equal to the Offer Amount, together with accrued interest thereon, to be held for payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9. On the Purchase Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment, on a
pro rata
basis to the extent necessary, an aggregate principal amount equal to the Offer Amount of Notes and other notes (in accordance with the terms of Section 4.17 of the Indenture) tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes and such other notes or portions thereof tendered, (ii) deliver or cause the Paying Agent or depositary, as the case may be, to deliver to the Trustee Notes so accepted and (iii) deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9. The Company, the Trustee or Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than three Business Days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price with respect to the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note, to such Holder, equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of such Holder's Notes surrendered. Any Note not accepted in the Asset Sale Offer shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company shall publicly announce in a newspaper of general circulation the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date.
 
36
The Asset Sale Offer shall be made by the Company in compliance with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, to the extent applicable, and all other applicable federal and state securities laws.
Each purchase pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.6 hereof to the extent applicable.
In the event the amount of Excess Proceeds to be applied to an Asset Sale Offer would result in the purchase of a principal amount of Notes which is not evenly divisible by 1,000, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly refund to the Company the portion of such Excess Proceeds that is not necessary to purchase the immediately lesser principal amount of Notes that is so divisible.
   
Section 3.10     Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes.
The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in this Article III), at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Company for redemption (a "
Tax Redemption Date
") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (and in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Company has or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Company cannot avoid any such payment obligation taking reasonable measures available, as a result of:
(1)
           
any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the relevant Tax Authority affecting taxation which becomes effective on or after the date of this Indenture (or, if the relevant Tax Authority has changed since the date of the Indenture, the date on which the then current Tax Authority became the applicable Tax Authority hereunder); or
(2)
           
any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice), and becomes effective on or after the date of this Indenture (or, if the relevant Tax Authority has changed since the date of this Indenture, the date on which the then current Tax Authority became the applicable Tax Authority hereunder).
The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the Company cannot avoid such obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the Company will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of an event described above.

provided, however
, that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of their respective Subsidiaries, if an officer of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders.
Section 4.6     Taxes.
The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay prior to delinquency all material taxes, assessments and governmental levies, except (i) as contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings or (ii) the nonpayment of which would not materially adversely affect the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

provided, however
, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written
 
39
notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

(3)
           
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock);
(4)
           
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issue and sale (other than to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Refinancing Indebtedness;
(5)
           
the repurchase of any Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions similar to the covenant set forth in Section 4.18 of the Indenture, provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such repurchase the Company has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such Change of Control Offer; and
(6)
           
additional payments to current or former employees or directors of the Company for repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests, provided that the aggregate amount of all such payments under this clause (6) does not exceed $5.0 million in any year and $20.0 million in the aggregate.
The Restricted Payments described in clauses (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph but shall reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section, and the Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) and (4) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph and shall not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision shall be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in the Company's EBITDA;
provided
,
however
, that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such Investment.
If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a
 
41
Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments. For the purpose of making any calculations under the Indenture:
(1)
           
an Investment shall include the fair market value of the net assets of any Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary and shall exclude the fair market value of the net assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary;
(2)
           
any property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be valued at fair market value at the time of such transfer,
provided
that, in each case, the fair market value of an asset or property is as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith; and
(3)
           
subject to the foregoing, the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, shall be determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive.
The Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the Section 4.15 of the Indenture. Upon such designation, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this covenant. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
Section 4.9     Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guaranty or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (collectively, "
incur
") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Company shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock;
provided
,
however
, that the Company may incur Indebtedness and may permit a Restricted Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness if at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto the Leverage Ratio would be less than 6.5 to 1.0.
The foregoing limitations shall not apply to:
(1)
           
the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Senior Bank Debt in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million at any one time outstanding;
(2)

the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Lease Obligations and/or additional Indebtedness constituting purchase money obligations up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding,
provided
that the Liens securing such Indebtedness constitute Permitted Liens;
 
42
(6)
           
the incurrence of Indebtedness between (i) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Restricted Subsidiaries;
(7)
           
Hedging Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk with respect to any floating rate Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be outstanding;
(8)
           
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising out of letters of credit, performance bonds, surety bonds and bankers' acceptances incurred in the ordinary course of business up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding;
(9)
           
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting of guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of Capital Stock; and
(10)
         
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Refinancing Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to repay, redeem, defease, extend, refinance, renew, replace or refund, Indebtedness referred to in clauses (2) through (5) above, and this clause (10) or that was otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 4.9.
Section 4.10     Liens.
Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (a) in the case of any Lien securing any Indebtedness that is subordinate to the Notes, the Notes are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Lien and (b) in the case of any other Lien, the Notes are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.
Section 4.11      Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(1)
           
(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (A) on its Capital Stock or (B) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2)
           
the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancing thereof,
provided
that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of this Indenture;
(3)           the Indenture and the Notes;
(4)           applicable law;
(5)
           
any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired,
provided
that the EBITDA of such Person is not taken into account in determining whether such acquisition was permitted by the terms of the Indenture;
(6)
           
customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices;
(7)
           
restrictions on the transfer of property subject to purchase money obligations or Capital Lease Obligations otherwise permitted by clause (5) of Section 4.9 hereof;
(8)
           
permitted Refinancing Indebtedness,
provided
that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; or
(9)
           
any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary
provided
that (i) at the time such agreement or instrument is entered into, such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries have a Leverage Ratio of less than 6.5 to 1.0 and (ii) neither such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) unless at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto, the Leverage Ratio for such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be less than 6.5 to 1.0. For purposes of determining the Leverage Ratio under this clause (9) only, all references to the "Company" and its "Restricted Subsidiaries" or similar references in the definition of "Leverage Ratio" and other defined terms necessary to determine the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to refer to such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries, respectively.
Section 4.12     Transactions with Affiliates.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each of the foregoing, an "
Affiliate Transaction
"), unless:
 
44
(a)
       
such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a non-Affiliated Person; and
(b)       the Company delivers to the Trustee:
(i)
            
with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of $5.0 million, a resolution of the board of directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above and such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the board of directors; and
(ii)
          
with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of $25.0 million, an opinion as to the fairness to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view issued by an investment banking firm of national standing.
The following items shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions and therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
(1)       any employment agreement entered into by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the past practice of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary;
(2)       transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(3)       transactions permitted by Section 4.8 hereof; and
(4)       the grant of stock, stock options or other equity interests to employees and directors of the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with duly adopted Company stock grant, stock option and similar plans.
The provisions set forth in clause (b) above shall not apply to sales of inventory by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Affiliate in the ordinary course of business. The provisions of clause (b) (ii) above shall not apply to loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from, or equity investments in the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary by, any Affiliate to the extent permitted by the provisions of Section 4.9 hereof.
Section 4.13     Certain Senior Subordinated Debt.
The Company shall not incur any Indebtedness that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Senior Debt of the Company and senior in any respect in right of payment to the Notes.

Section 4.14     Additional Subsidiary Guarantees.
 
45
If any entity (other than an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall become a Restricted Subsidiary after the date hereof, then such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute a supplemental indenture in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto, pursuant to which it shall provide a Subsidiary Guarantee and deliver an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
No Restricted Subsidiary (including any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company) whether or not affiliated with such Restricted Subsidiary unless:
(1)
           
subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Restricted Subsidiary) assumes all the obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee (except in the case of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;
(2)
           
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(3)
           
such Restricted Subsidiary, or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger, would be permitted to incur, immediately after giving effect to such transaction, at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of Section 4.9 hereof.
In the event of:
(1)
           
a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of any Restricted Subsidiary, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise;
(2)           a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3)
           
the designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of Section 4.15 hereof,
then such Restricted Subsidiary (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Restricted Subsidiary or in the event of the designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or the Person acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee,
provided
that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 4.17 herein.
Section 4.15     Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including any Restricted Subsidiary or any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary so long as:
(1)
           
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary;
 
46
(2)
           
no default with respect to any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary would permit (upon notice, lapse of time or otherwise) any holder of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to declare a default on such other Indebtedness or cause the payment thereof to be accelerated or payable prior to its stated maturity;
(3)
           
any Investment in such Subsidiary deemed to be made as a result of designating such Subsidiary an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not violate the provisions of Section 4.8 of the Indenture;
(4)
           
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has a contract, agreement, arrangement, understanding or obligation of any kind, whether written or oral, with such Subsidiary other than (A) those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company or (B) administrative, tax sharing and other ordinary course contracts, agreements, arrangements and understandings or obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business; and
(5)
           
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for additional shares of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, or to maintain or preserve such Subsidiary's financial condition or to cause such Subsidiary to achieve certain levels of operating results other than as permitted under Section 4.8 hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not designate as an Unrestricted Subsidiary any Subsidiary which, on the 1999 Indenture Date, was a Significant Subsidiary, and may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets of any such Significant Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case other than Iron Mountain Global, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (including without limitation Iron Mountain Europe Limited and its Subsidiaries).
The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided
that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if:
(1)           such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.9 hereof; and
(2)            no Default or Event of Default would occur as a result of such designation.
Section 4.16     Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction unless:
(1)
           
the consideration received in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is at least equal to the fair market value of the property sold, as determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and
(2)
           
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could incur the Attributable Indebtedness in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction in compliance with Section 4.9 herein.
Section 4.17     Asset Sales.
 
47
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to:
(1)
           
sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction, but excluding a Qualifying Sale and Leaseback Transaction) other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business (
provided
that the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.18 hereof and/or the provisions of Section 5.1 hereof and not by the provisions of this Section 4.17); or
(2)           issue or sell Equity Interests of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that in the case of either clause (1) or (2) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions:
(i)          have a fair market value in excess of $10.0 million; or
(ii)
          
result in Net Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million (each of the foregoing, an "
Asset Sale
"), unless (x) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or like-kind assets (in each case as determined in good faith by the Company, evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors and certified by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee);
provided
,
however
, that the amount of:
(A)
  
any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets; and
(B)
     
any notes or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are immediately converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) or Cash Equivalents,
shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and
provided
,
further
, that the 75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (ii) (y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by the Company to a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary or by a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to another Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an Asset Sale.
Within 360 days of any Asset Sale, the Company may, at its option, apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either:
 
48
(1)           to permanently reduce Senior Debt; or
(2)
           
to an investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or in another business or capital expenditure or other long-term/tangible assets, in each case, in the same line of business as the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries was engaged in on the date of this Indenture or in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto.
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Bank Debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute "
Excess Proceeds
." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes, all holders of the 8 1/4% Notes, the 8 1/8% Notes, the 8 5/8% Notes, the 7 3/4% Notes and the 6 5/8% Notes and the holders of any future Indebtedness ranking
pari passu
with the Notes, which Indebtedness contains similar provisions requiring the Company to repurchase such Indebtedness (an "
Asset Sale Offer
"), to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other
pari passu
Indebtedness (including the 8 1/4% Notes, the 8 1/8% Notes, the 8 5/8% Notes, the 7 3/4% Notes and the 6 5/8% Notes) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.17, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
An Asset Sale Offer shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.17 hereof. No later than the date which is five Business Days after the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Asset Sale Offer and provide the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate setting forth the calculations used in determining the amount of Net Proceeds to be applied to the purchase of Notes. The Company shall commence or cause to be commenced the Asset Sale Offer on a date no later than 15 Business Days after such notice (the "
Commencement Date
").
Section 4.18     Change of Control.
(a)
       
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to 1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "
Change of Control Offer
") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of repurchase (the "
Change of Control Payment
"). If and for so long as the notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require, the Company shall publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in the
Luxemburger Wort
or any other leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg.
 
49
Within 30 calendar days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, stating:
(1)
           
that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.18 and that all Notes tendered shall be accepted for payment;
(2)
           
the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days nor later than 60 calendar days from the date such notice is mailed (the "
Change of Control Payment Date
");
(3)           that any Note not tendered shall continue to accrue interest;
(4)
           
that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date;
(5)
           
that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in such notice prior to the close of business on the fifth Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;
(6)
           
that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Notes purchased; and
(7)
           
that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to 75,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the repurchase of the Notes in connection with a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this section, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions hereof by virtue of such conflict.
(b)
       
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
(1)
           
accept for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2)
           
deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and
(3)
           
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the Notes or portions thereof tendered to the Company.
 
50
The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes so accepted the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
provided
that each such new Note shall be in a principal amount of 75,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.18 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer.
Section 4.19     Additional Amounts.
All payments made by the Company under or with respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any of the Guarantors on its Subsidiary Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Guarantor (including any Successor Entity), is then incorporated or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "
Tax Authority
"), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes of any Tax Authority will at any time be required to be made from or imposed directly on any Holder or beneficial owner of the notes on any payments made by the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "
Additional Amounts
") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received and retained in respect of such payments by each Holder or beneficial owner (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding, deduction or imposition will equal the respective amounts which would have been received and retained in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition;
provided, however
, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1)
           
any payments on a Note in respect of Taxes which would not have been imposed but for the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note being, or having been, a citizen or resident or national of, incorporated in, or carrying on a business in the jurisdiction in which such Taxes are imposed other than by the mere holding of such Note or enforcement of rights thereunder or the receipt of payments in respect thereof;
(2)
           
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of the Holder of a Note or beneficial owner of a Note to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement, which is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant taxing jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes;
(3)
           
any Note presented for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(4)
           
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Tax or assessment;
 
51
(5)
           
any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual and which are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(6)
           
any Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder of a Note who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(8)
           
any person who is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual holder of the Note;
(9)
           
any Holder of a Note or a beneficial owner of a Note that is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
Code
"), or any successor provision;
(10)
         
any Holder of a Note or a beneficial owner of a Note that is a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; or
(11)         any combination of items (1) through (10) above.
In addition to the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors will also pay any present or future stamp, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies or Taxes which are levied by any Tax Authority on the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Subsidiary Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees. The Company and the Guarantors will not, however, be obligated to pay any present or future stamp, transfer, court or documentary tax, or any other excise or property tax, charge or similar levy or Tax which is levied by any Tax Authority in connection with any transfer of any Note by any Holder.
If the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date which is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that payment date, in which case the Company or the relevant guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officers' Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts.
The Company or the relevant Guarantor will make all required withholdings and deductions and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will use commercially
 
52
reasonable efforts to facilitate administrative actions necessary to assist beneficial owners to obtain any refund of or credit against Taxes for which Additional Amounts are not paid as a result of the conditions in the proviso to the first paragraph of this Section 4.19.
In the event that either the Company or the relevant Guarantor has become, or would be, obliged to pay on the next date on which any amount would be payable under or with respect to the Notes, any Additional Amounts as a result of certain changes affecting the laws relating to withholding or deduction of Taxes, the Company may redeem all, but not less than all, the Notes in accordance with Section 3.10 hereof.
Whenever in this Indenture, there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

Section 6.3     Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers.
 
61
(e)
     
The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
(f)
       
The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of Notes unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
(g)
       
The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney at the sole cost of the Company and shall incur no liability or additional liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.
(h)

The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any Person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any Person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.

The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee and the Paying Agents, in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
Section 7.3     Individual Rights of Trustee.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
Section 7.4     Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Notes other than its authentication.
Section 7.5     Notice of Defaults.
If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes and if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of the
 
62
 
 
Notes a notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as its corporate trust committee or a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders.
Section 7.6     Reports by Trustee to Holders.
Within 60 days after May 15 in each year, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear on the register kept by the Registrar and a brief report dated as of such May 15, in accordance with, and to the extent required under, TIA  313.
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or any delisting thereof.
Section 7.7     Compensation and Indemnity.
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall agree in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
The Company shall indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their agents (including the cost of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, or any Holder or any other Person)) against any and all loss, damages, claims, liability or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred by it except as set forth in the next paragraph in the performance of their duties under this Indenture as Trustee or Agent. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This indemnification shall apply to officers, directors, employees, shareholders and agents of the Trustee.
The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee or by any officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of the Trustee due to its own negligence or bad faith.
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on the Notes.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(g) or (h) (or any comparable provisions set forth in a supplemental indenture) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA  313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.
 
63
The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
Section 7.8     Replacement of Trustee.
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.
The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
(a)          the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(b)          the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(c)          a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(d)          the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder, who has been a Holder for at least six months, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.7, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to each Holder. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring trustee with respect to expenses and liabilities incurred by it prior to such replacement.
Section 7.9      Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
 
64
Section 7.10     Eligibility; Disqualification.
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA  310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b).
Section 7.11     Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
The Trustee is subject to TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
ARTICLE VIII.
LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE
Section 8.1     Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have either Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article VIII.
Section 8.2     Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.2, each of the Company and the Guarantors, if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes and related Subsidiary Guarantees on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "
Legal Defeasance
"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.5 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under the Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.4 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's and Guarantors' obligations with respect to the Notes under Article II hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article VIII. Subject to compliance with this Article VIII, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.3 hereof.
Section 8.3     Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.3, each of the Company and the Guarantors, if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants specified in Article IV and Article V hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes and related Subsidiary Guarantees on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "
Covenant Defeasance
"),
 
65
and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture, the Notes and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, if any, shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.3 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, Sections 6.1(c) through 6.1(f) and 6.1(i) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.
Section 8.4      Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.
The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof to the outstanding Notes:
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(a)
       
the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in pounds sterling, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the outstanding Notes;
(b)
    
in the case of an election under Section 8.2 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States (which counsel may be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(c)
    
in the case of an election under Section 8.3 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States (which counsel may be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(d)
       
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as Sections 6.1(g) and 6.1(h) hereof are concerned, at any time in the
 
66
period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit (or greater period of time in which any such deposit of trust funds may remain subject to Bankruptcy Law insofar as those apply to the deposit by the Company);
(e)
     
such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;
(f)
      
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally;
(g)
      
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of such Notes over any other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and
(h)
      
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
Section 8.5
     
Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to Section 8.6 hereof, all money and non-callable Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.5, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of the Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company and the Guarantors shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance.
Anything in this Article VIII to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.4 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.4(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
67
Section 8.6     Repayment to Company.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Notes subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium or Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, if any, have become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided, however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in
The New York Times
,
The Wall Street Journal
(national edition) and
The Luxembourg Wort
(so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
Section 8.7     Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any pounds sterling or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture, the Notes and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, if any, shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, as the case may be;
provided, however
, that, if the Company make any payment of principal of, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, if any, on any such Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
ARTICLE IX.
AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS
Section 9.1     Without Consent of Holders.
Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes:
(a)
       
to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,
(b)
       
to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes,
(c)
       
to provide for the assumption of the Company's or any Guarantor's obligations to Holders in the case of a merger or consolidation,
(d)
       
to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders (including providing for additional Subsidiary Guarantees) or that does not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder, or
(e)
       
to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA.
 
68
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
Section 9.2     With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 of the Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.12 hereof any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After a supplemental indenture or waiver under this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture or waiver. Any failure by the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
Section 9.3     Limitations.
Without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder of Notes):
(a)
       
reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(b)
       
reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of any Note in a manner adverse to the Holders of the Notes;
(c)
       
reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
 
69
(d)
       
waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(e)
       
make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes other than to the extent that the United Kingdom adopts the euro;
(f)
       
make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Notes;
(g)
       
waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Section 4.17 or 4.18 hereof);
(h)
       
except pursuant to the Indenture, release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, or change any Subsidiary Guarantee in any manner that would materially adversely affect the Holders; or
(i)
       
make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.3 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
Section 9.4     Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a supplemental indenture hereto that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 9.5     Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of a Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective.
Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Holder affected by such amendment or waiver unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (a) through (h) of Section 9.3. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note.
Section 9.6     Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for Notes may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate upon request new Notes that reflect the amendment or waiver.
 
70
Section 9.7     Trustee to Sign Amendments; Trustee Protected.
The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES
Section 12.1     Subsidiary Guarantee.
Each Subsidiary that is a signatory hereto and each of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries other than the Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (each, a "
Guarantor
"), hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of the Notes, that: (i) the principal of, Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due, whether at the maturity or interest payment or mandatory redemption date, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or the Notes will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Notes; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, each Guarantor will be obligated to pay the same whether or not such failure to pay has become an Event of Default which could cause acceleration pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment not a guarantee of collection.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to this Subsidiary Guarantee shall be joint and several and unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Notes or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Notes, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, waives and relinquishes all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (a) any right to require the Trustee, the Holders or the Company (each, a "
Benefited Party
") to proceed against the Company or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by a Benefited Party at any time or to pursue any other remedy in any Benefited Party's power before proceeding against such Guarantor; (b) the defense of the statute of limitations in any action hereunder or in any action for the collection of any Indebtedness or the performance of any obligation hereby guaranteed; (c) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of any other Person or the failure of a Benefited Party to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other Person; (d) demand, protest and notice of any kind including but not limited to notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional Indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of such Guarantor,
 
75
 
the Company, any Benefited Party, any creditor of such Guarantor, the Company or on the part of any other Person whomsoever in connection with any Indebtedness or obligations hereby guaranteed; (e) any defense based upon an election of remedies by a Benefited Party, including but not limited to an election to proceed against such Guarantor for reimbursement; (f) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (g) any defense arising because of a Benefited Party's election, in any proceeding instituted under Bankruptcy Law, of the application of 11 U.S.C. Section 1111(b)(2); or (h) any defense based on any borrowing or grant of a security interest under 11 U.S.C. Section 364. Each Guarantor hereby covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Indenture.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to either the Company or any Guarantor, or any Custodian acting in relation to either the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, the applicable Subsidiary Guarantees, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated and be in full force and effect. Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration as to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of those obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, those obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee.
Section 12.2     Limitation of Guarantor's Liability.
Each Guarantor and, by its acceptance hereof, the Trustee and each Holder hereby confirm that it is its intention that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each such Person hereby irrevocably agrees that the obligation of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee under this Article 12 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or other) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article XII, result in the obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under said laws. The Trustee and each Holder by accepting the benefits hereof, confirms its intention that, in the event of a bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding of the Company or any Guarantor in which concurrent claims are made upon such Guarantor hereunder, to the extent such claims will not be fully satisfied, each such claimant with a valid claim against the Company shall be entitled to a ratable share of all payments by such Guarantor in respect of such concurrent claims. For all purposes of this Section 12.2, Senior Debt shall be deemed to have been incurred prior to the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the Subsidiary Guarantees.
 
76
ARTICLE XIII.
SUBORDINATION
Section 13.1     Agreement to Subordinate.
The Company, the Trustee and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the indebtedness and obligations evidenced by the Note (a) rank
pari passu
with the Company's Obligations relating to the Existing Senior Subordinated Notes and (b) are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article, to the prior payment in full, in cash, of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt of the Company.
Section 13.2     Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy.
Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company's assets and liabilities:
(1)
           
holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt of the Company (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt of the Company, whether or not allowed as a claim in such proceeding) before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution from the Company with respect to the Notes; and
(2)
           
until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Trustee or any Holder would be entitled but for this Article shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of the Company, as their interests may appear.
Section 13.3     Default on Designated Senior Debt.
The Company may not make any payment or distribution upon or in respect of the Notes, including, without limitation, by way of set-off or otherwise, or redeem (or make a deposit in redemption of), defease or acquire any of the Notes, for cash, properties or securities if:
(i)
            
a default in the payment of any principal, premium, if any, or interest or other Obligations (a "
Payment Default
") with respect to Senior Debt of the Company occurs and is continuing; or
(ii)
          
a default (other than a Payment Default) or any event that, after notice or passage of time would become a default (a "
Non-Monetary Default
"), on Senior Debt of the Company occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of the Senior Debt of the Company to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "
Payment Blockage Notice
") from a Person who may give it pursuant to Section 13.11 hereof. Any number of such Payment Blockage Notices may be given,
provided, however
, that (i) not more than one Payment Blockage Notice may be commenced during any period of 360 consecutive days and (ii) any Non-Monetary Default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any such notice to the Trustee (to the extent the holder of Designated Senior Debt, or such trustee or agent, giving such Payment
 
77
Blockage Notice had knowledge of the same) shall not be the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice, unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 days.
The Company may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes and all Obligations with respect thereto, and may acquire such Notes or Obligations upon the earlier of:
(1)
           
in the case of a payment default, the date upon which such default is cured or waived, or
(2)
           
in the case of a Non-Monetary Default, on the earlier of the date on which such Non-Monetary Default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, if the maturity of such Senior Debt of the Company has not been accelerated,
if this Article 13 otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time thereof.
Section 13.4     Acceleration of Notes.
If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify Representatives of the holders of Senior Debt of the Company of the acceleration.
Section 13.5     When Distribution Must be Paid Over.
In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives from the Company any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by Section 13.2 or 13.3 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or such Holder in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to, the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, as their interests may appear, or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt of the Company may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt of the Company.
With respect to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 13, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 13, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
Section 13.6     Notice By Company.
The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt of the Company as provided in this Article.
 
78
Section 13.7     Subrogation.
After all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company are paid in full, in cash, and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness
pari passu
with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of the Company to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt of the Company to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt of the Company. A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt of the Company that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on the Notes.
Section 13.8      Relative Rights.
This Article defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Debt of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
(1)
           
impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes in accordance with their terms;
(2)
           
affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt of the Company; or
(3)
           
prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt of the Company to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders.
If the Company fails because of this Article 13 to pay principal of, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
Section 13.9     Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company.
No right of any holder of Senior Debt of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder or by the failure of the Company or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.
Section 13.10     Distribution or Notice to Representative.
Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt of the Company, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 13, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt of the Company and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount or amounts thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 13.
Section 13.11     Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
 
79
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 13 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment a Payment Blockage Notice. Only the holders or the Representative of holders of Designated Senior Debt of the Company may give a Payment Blockage Notice. Nothing in this Article 13 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
Section 13.12     Authorization to Effect Subordination.
Each Holder of a Note by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 13, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.4 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives of the Senior Debt of the Company are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.
Section 13.13     Amendments.
The provisions of this Article 13 shall not be amended or modified without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt of the Company.
Section 13.14     Subordination of Subsidiary Guarantees.
Each Guarantor, the Trustee, and Holder of the Notes agrees, that the indebtedness and obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees (a) rank
pari passu
with the Guarantor's guarantees of the Existing Senior Subordinated Notes and (b) are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 13, to the prior payment in full, in cash, of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
Section 13.15     Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy of a Guarantor.
Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of any Guarantor in a liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of such Guarantor's assets and liabilities:
(1)
           
holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt of such Guarantor (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt of such Guarantor, whether or not allowed as a claim in such proceeding) before the Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution from the Guarantor with respect to such Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee; and
 
80
(2)
           
until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Trustee or any Holder would be entitled but for this Article shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, as their interests may appear.
Section 13.16     Default on Senior Debt of the Guarantor.
No Guarantor shall make any payment or distribution upon or in respect of the Notes or its Subsidiary Guarantee, including, without limitation, by way of set-off or otherwise, or redeem (or make a deposit in redemption of), defease or acquire any of the Notes, for cash, properties or securities if:
(i)
            
a Payment Default with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor occurs and is continuing; or
(ii)
          
a Non-Monetary Default on Senior Debt of such Guarantor occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of the Senior Debt of such Guarantor to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a Payment Blockage Notice from a Person who may give it pursuant to Section 13.24 hereof. Any number of such Payment Blockage Notices may be given,
provided, however
, that (i) not more than one Payment Blockage Notice may be commenced during any period of 360 consecutive days and (ii) any default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee (to the extent the holder of Designated Senior Debt, or such trustee or agent, giving such Payment Blockage Notice had knowledge of the same) shall not be the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to Section 13.24 herein, unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
Each Guarantor may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of its Subsidiary Guarantee, the Notes and all Obligations with respect thereto, and may acquire such Notes or Obligations upon the earlier of:
(1)
           
in the case of a payment default, the date upon which such default is cured or waived, or
(2)
           
in the case of a Non-Monetary Default, on the earlier of the date on which such Non-Monetary Default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, if the maturity of such Senior Debt of such Guarantor has not been accelerated,
if this Article 13 otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time thereof.
Section 13.17     Acceleration of Notes; Duties of Guarantors.
If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, each Guarantor shall promptly notify the Representative of the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor of the acceleration.
Section 13.18     When Distribution from Guarantor Must Be Paid Over.
In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives from a Guarantor any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees at a time when the Trustee or such
 
81
Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by Section 13.15 or 13.16 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to, the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, as their interests may appear, or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt of such Guarantor may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
With respect to the holders of Senior Debt of any Guarantor, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 13, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 13, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
Section 13.19     Notice by a Guarantor.
Each Guarantor shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to such Guarantor that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes or its Subsidiary Guarantee to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of its Subsidiary Guarantee or of the Notes to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor as provided in this Article 13.
Section 13.20     Subrogation with Respect to Any Guarantor.
With respect to any Guarantor, after all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, in cash, and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness
pari passu
with such Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt of such Guarantor to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt of such Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between such Guarantor and Holders, a payment by such Guarantor on the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantee.
Section 13.21     Relative Rights with Respect to Any Guarantor.
This Article defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Debt of each Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
(1)
           
impair, as between such Guarantor and the Holders, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes in accordance with the terms of its Subsidiary Guarantee;
(2)
           
affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of such Guarantor other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor; or
 
82
(3)
           
prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor set forth herein to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders.
If any Guarantor fails because of this Article 13 to pay principal of, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
Section 13.22     Subordination May Not Be Impaired By Any Guarantor.
With respect to any Guarantor, no right of any holder of Senior Debt of such Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Guarantor or any Holder or by failure of such Guarantor or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.

With respect to any Guarantor, whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of any Guarantor referred to in this Article 13, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt of such Guarantor and other Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount or amounts thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 13.
Section 13.24     Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent with Respect to Any Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 13 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment a Payment Blockage Notice. Only the Representative of holders of Designated Senior Debt may give a Payment Blockage Notice. Nothing in this Article 13 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.
With respect to any Guarantor, the Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt of such Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
