Exhibit 99.1 Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports Second Quarter 2006 Financial Results - Total Revenues are $582 Million, Up 14% - Operating Income is $103 Million - OIBDA is $154 Million; 26.5% of Revenues - Net Income is $0.28 per Diluted Share BOSTON, July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, reporting higher revenues, strong internal revenue growth and net income for the quarter of $0.28 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 grew to $582 million, an increase of 14% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2005. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 12% and service revenues grew 15% compared to the same period in 2005. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records management and data protection services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 70th consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the second quarter of 2006, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 11% and 8%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 10% for the quarter. "Our business is performing well across geographies and service lines led by strong revenue growth, particularly storage revenues, the key driver of our business. We continue making the investments we believe will further enhance our ability to capture the tremendous market opportunity we see before us and drive future revenue growth and profitability," stated Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO. Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $154 million, or 26.5% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 compared to $141 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the second quarter of 2006 was $103 million, or 18% of revenues, compared to $97 million, or 19% of revenues, for the same period in 2005. Net income for the quarter was $38 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $25 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Included in net income for the quarter is $7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised of foreign currency related net gains. The foreign currency related gains were due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar compared to March 31, 2006. Included in net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, is $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.1 billion, an increase of 13%, with storage revenues growing at 12% and service revenues growing at 14% compared to the prior year. For the first six months of the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 11% and 8%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%. OIBDA was $296 million, or 25.9% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2006 compared to $277 million, or 27.3% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2005.
Operating income for the first six months of 2006 was $195 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $188 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2005. Net income was $65 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2006, compared to $48 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2005. Included in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, is $10 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains, due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. Included in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005, is $10 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain acquires attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and information protection and storage service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of the first quarter, the Company has completed several acquisitions including a 50.1% joint venture in India, a leading data protection business in Australia/New Zealand, a document management services business in Brazil, and several small shredding and records management businesses in North America.

As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding. Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments, or FCF FCF is defined as Cash Flows From Operating Activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions): Six Months Ended June 30, ----------------- 2005 2006 ------- ------- Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments $ 54 $ 13 Add: Capital Expenditures, net 131 154 Additions to Customer Acquisition Costs 7 7 Cash Flows From Operating Activities (2) $ 191 $ 174 Cash Paid for Acquisitions and Investments, net $ 35 $ 74 (2) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
