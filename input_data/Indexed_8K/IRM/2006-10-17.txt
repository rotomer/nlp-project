(4)
 
make any Investment other than a Permitted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as Restricted Payments);
 
unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:
 
 
 
 
The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:
 
(1)
 
the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;
 
 
-38-
(2)
 
the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Stock);
 
(3)
 
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock);

(5)
 
the repurchase of any Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions similar to the covenant set forth in Section 4.18 of the Indenture, provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such repurchase the Company has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such Change of Control Offer; and
 
(6)
 
additional payments to current or former employees or directors of the Company for repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests, provided that the aggregate amount of all such payments under this clause (6) does not exceed $0.5 million in any year and $2.0 million in the aggregate.
 
The Restricted Payments described in clauses (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph but shall reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (C) of the first paragraph of this Section, and the Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) and (4) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph and shall not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (C) of the first paragraph of this Section.

If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments.

to an investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or in another business or capital expenditure or other long-term/tangible assets, in each case, in the same line of business as the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries was engaged in on the date of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto.
 
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Bank Debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes, all holders of the 8% Notes, the 8% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 7% Notes and the 6% Notes and the holders of any future Indebtedness ranking

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other
pari passu
Indebtedness (including the 8% Notes, the 8% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 7% Notes and the 6% Notes) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the
 
 
-48-
Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.17, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

No later than the date which is five Business Days after the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Asset Sale Offer and provide the Trustee with an Officers Certificate setting forth the calculations used in determining the amount of Net Proceeds to be applied to the purchase of Notes.

If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that if any Obligation with respect to Senior Bank Debt is outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement upon a declaration of acceleration of the Notes, the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will not be payable until the earlier of: (1) the day which is five business days after written notice of acceleration is received by the Company and the Credit Agent; or (2) the date of acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary, the principal of, and premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without further action or notice. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in Section 6.1(e) of the Indenture, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the holders of any Indebtedness described in such section have rescinded the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 30 days from the date of such declaration and if: (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a competent jurisdiction; and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.
