Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS * Total Revenues are $596 Million, Up 13% * Operating Income is $97 Million * OIBDA is $150 Million; 25.2% of Revenues * Net Income is $0.20 per Diluted Share BOSTON, Oct. 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006, reporting higher revenues, strong storage internal revenue growth and net income for the quarter of $0.20 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 grew to $596 million, an increase of 13% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2005. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 14% and service revenues grew 12% compared to the same period in 2005. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 71st consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the third quarter of 2006, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 11% and 3%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 7%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 9% for the quarter. The service internal growth rate and the total internal growth rate were both impacted by a large data restoration project completed by the Company's digital business in the third quarter of 2005 that did not repeat in 2006. "Our business continues to perform as expected and as we forecasted at our Investor Day earlier this month. Strong revenue growth, particularly in storage revenues, a key driver of our business, remains a highlight as our customer facing investments continue to generate the anticipated results," stated Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO. "We are confident that our on-going growth and productivity investments, which are designed to enhance our ability to drive long-term, increasingly profitable growth and ultimately higher shareholder value, will generate similar success." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $150 million, or 25.2% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 compared to $148 million, or 28.1% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was $97 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $102 million, or 19% of revenues, for the same period in 2005. Net income for the quarter was $27 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $36 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Included in net income for the quarter is $1 million, or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of charges related to the early extinguishment of debt associated with the Company's financing activities partially offset by foreign currency related net gains. The foreign currency related gains were due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling compared to June 30, 2006. Included in net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, is $7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains, due mainly to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $1.7 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues and service revenues also grew 13% for the first nine months of 2006 compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 10% and 6%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%.
OIBDA was $447 million, or 25.7% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to $425 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005. Operating income for the first nine months of 2006 was $292 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $290 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2005. Net income was $92 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006, compared to $85 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2005. Included in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, is $9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains, due mainly to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar, partially offset by charges related to the early extinguishment of debt associated with the Company's financing activities. Included in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro offset by the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain acquires attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. During the third quarter, the Company completed several small shredding and records management business acquisitions in North America.

As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding. Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments, or FCF FCF is defined as Cash Flows From Operating Activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions): Nine Months Ended September 30, ----------------------- 2005 2006 ---------- ---------- Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments $ 89 $ 12 Add: Capital Expenditures, net 180 256 Additions to Customer Acquisition Costs 10 10 Cash Flows From Operating Activities (2) $ 279 $ 279 (2) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
