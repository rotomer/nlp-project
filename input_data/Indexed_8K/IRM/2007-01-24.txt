No later than one Business Day after the termination of the Offer Period (the Purchase Date), the Company shall purchase the principal amount (the Offer Amount) of Notes required to be purchased in such Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 4.17 hereof or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer.
 
If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any interest accrued to such Purchase Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest shall be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.
 
On the Commencement Date of any Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall send or cause to be sent, by first class mail, a notice to each of the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable the Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer and shall state:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22
On or before 12:00 noon on each Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent in immediately available funds the aggregate purchase price with respect to a principal amount of Notes equal to the Offer Amount, together with accrued interest thereon, to be held for payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.10. On the Purchase Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment, on a
pro rata
basis to the extent necessary, an aggregate principal amount equal to the Offer Amount of Notes and other notes (in accordance with the terms of Section 4.17 of the Indenture) tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes and such other notes or portions thereof tendered, (ii) deliver or cause the Paying Agent or Depository, as the case may be, to deliver to the Trustee Notes so accepted and (iii) deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.10. The Company, Depository or Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than three Business Days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price with respect to the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note, to such Holder, equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of such Holders Notes surrendered. Any Note not accepted in the Asset Sale Offer shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company shall publicly announce in a newspaper of general circulation the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date.
 
The Asset Sale Offer shall be made by the Company in compliance with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, to the extent applicable, and all other applicable federal and state securities laws.
 
Each purchase pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.6 hereof to the extent applicable.
 
In the event the amount of Excess Proceeds to be applied to an Asset Sale Offer would result in the purchase of a principal amount of Notes which is not evenly divisible by 50,000, the Trustee shall promptly refund to the Company the portion of such Excess Proceeds that is not necessary to purchase the immediately lesser principal amount of Notes that is so divisible.
 
Section 2.6.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:
 
 
 
 
24
concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock);
 
 
 
 
The Restricted Payments described in clauses (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph but shall reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section, and the Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) and (4) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph and shall not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
 
If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision shall be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in the Companys EBITDA; provided,
however
, that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such Investment. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt and to avoid double counting, if an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, then the subsequent assignment, contribution, distribution or other transfer of such Investment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be considered a new Investment or Restricted Payment and shall not further reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
 
If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments.
 
For the purpose of making any Restricted Payment calculations under the Indenture:
 
25
 
 
 
The Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with Section 4.15 of the Indenture. Upon such designation, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this covenant. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The following items shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions and therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
 
 
 
 
 
The provisions set forth in clause (b) above shall not apply to sales of inventory by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Affiliate in the ordinary course of business. The provisions of clause (b) (ii) above shall not apply to loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary

4.14.
Additional Subsidiary Guarantees

If any entity (other than an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall become a Restricted Subsidiary after the date of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, then such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute a supplemental indenture in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, pursuant to which it shall provide a Subsidiary Guarantee and deliver an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
 
No Restricted Subsidiary (including any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company) whether or not affiliated with such Restricted Subsidiary unless:
 
 
 
 
In the event of:
 
 
 
 
then such Restricted Subsidiary (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Restricted Subsidiary or in the event of the
 
30
designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or the Person acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, provided that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 4.17 of the Indenture.

Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
 
4.15.
Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries
. The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including any Restricted Subsidiary or any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary so long as:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not designate as an Unrestricted Subsidiary any Subsidiary which, on the 1999 Indenture Date, was a Significant Subsidiary, and may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets of any such Significant Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case other than Iron Mountain Global, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Iron Mountain Europe Limited and its Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 4.15 shall not limit or restrict the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets to any other Subsidiary, including any Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent such sale, transfer or other disposition is permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described under Section 4.12 or Section 4.17.
 
The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a
 
31
Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if:
 
 
 
(i)
 
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.
 
4.16.
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

resolution of the Board of Directors and certified by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee);
 
provided
,
however
, that the amount of:
 
 
 
shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and provided, further, that the 75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (ii) (y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, a disposition that constitutes a Restricted Payment will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.8 and not by this Section 4.17.
 
A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by the Company to a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary or by a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to another Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an Asset Sale.
 
Within 360 days of any Asset Sale, the Company may, at its option, apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either:
 
 
 
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Bank Debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes, all holders of the 8% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 6% Notes, the 8% Notes, the 8% Notes and the 6% Notes and the holders of any future Indebtedness ranking

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other
pari passu
Indebtedness (including
 
33
the 8% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 7% Notes, the 6% Notes, the 8 % Notes, the 8% Notes and the 6% Notes) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.17, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
 
An Asset Sale Offer shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.10 hereof. No later than the date which is five Business Days after the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Asset Sale Offer and provide the Trustee with an Officers Certificate setting forth the calculations used in determining the amount of Net Proceeds to be applied to the purchase of Notes.

Prior to complying with the provisions of this Section 4.18, but in any event within 90 calendar days following a Change of Control, the Company shall either repay all outstanding Senior Debt or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements governing outstanding Senior Debt to permit the repurchase of Notes required by this Section 4.18. The Company shall publicly announce in The Wall Street Journal, or if no longer published, a national newspaper of general circulation, the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.18 applicable to a Change of Control Offer

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes of any Tax Authority shall at any time be required to be made from or imposed directly on any Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes on any payments made by the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, shall pay such additional amounts (the Additional Tax Amounts), as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received and retained in respect of such payments by each Holder or beneficial owner (including Additional Tax Amounts) after such withholding, deduction or imposition shall equal the respective amounts which would have been received and retained in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition;
provided
,
however
, that no Additional Tax Amounts shall be payable with respect to:
36
(a)
 
any payments on a Note in respect of Taxes which would not have been imposed but for the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note being, or having been, a citizen or resident or national of, incorporated in, or carrying on a business in the jurisdiction in which such Taxes are imposed other than by the mere holding of such Note or enforcement of rights thereunder or the receipt of payments in respect thereof;
 
(b)
 
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of the Holder of a Note or beneficial owner of a Note to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement, which is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant taxing jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes;
 
(c)
 
any Note presented for payment (where Notes are in physical, certificated form and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Tax Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
 
(d)
 
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Tax or assessment;
 
(e)

(f)
 
any Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder of a Note who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
 
(g)
 
any Taxes payable otherwise than by way of deduction or withholding;
 
(h)
 
any person who is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Tax Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual holder of the Note;
 
(i)
 
any Holder of a Note or a beneficial owner of a Note that is or was a 10-percent shareholder of the Company as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), or any successor provision;
 
(j)
 
any Holder of a Note or a beneficial owner of a Note that is a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; or
 
(k)
 
any combination of items (a) through (j) above.
 
37

The Company and the Guarantors shall not, however, be obligated to pay any present or future stamp, transfer, court or documentary tax, or any other excise or property tax, charge or similar levy or Tax which is levied by any Tax Authority in connection with any transfer of any Note by any Holder.
 
If the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it shall be obligated to pay Additional Tax Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any guarantee, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Trustee on a date which is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Tax Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that payment date, in which case the Company or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officers Certificate stating the fact that Additional Tax Amounts shall be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officers Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Tax Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The Company or the relevant Guarantor shall provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional Tax Amounts.
 
The Company or the relevant Guarantor shall make all required withholdings and deductions and shall remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate administrative actions necessary to assist beneficial owners to obtain any refund of or credit against Taxes for which Additional Tax Amounts are not paid as a result of the conditions in the proviso to the first paragraph of this Section 4.20.
 
In the event that either the Company or the relevant Guarantor has become, or would be, obliged to pay on the next date on which any amount would be payable under or with respect to the Notes, any Additional Tax Amounts as a result of certain changes affecting the laws relating to withholding or deduction of Taxes, the Company may redeem all, but not less than all, the Notes in accordance with Section 3.8.
 
Whenever in the Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Tax Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Tax Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
