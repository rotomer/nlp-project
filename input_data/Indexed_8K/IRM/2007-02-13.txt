On February 8, 2007, Iron Mountain Incorporated (the Company) issued a press release announcing that Brian McKeon will become the Companys Chief Financial Officer. Mr. McKeon, 44, joins the Company from The Timberland Company (NYSE: TBL), a $1.6 billion global footwear and apparel company based in New Hampshire, where he has served in a similar capacity since 2000. Prior to joining The Timberland Company, Mr. McKeon spent more than eight years at PepsiCo, during which time he held several executive positions in finance and strategic planning, culminating in his being named Vice President, Finance of the Pepsi-Cola North America division. Mr. McKeon received a BS in Accounting from the University of Connecticut and an MBA from Harvard University. Mr. McKeon will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer from John F. Kenny, Jr., who has been named Executive Vice President, Corporate Development. Mr. Kenny will continue in the role of Chief Financial Officer until Mr. McKeon assumes his new post.
