Exhibit 99.1 IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS Company Issues 2007 Full-Year Guidance * Total Revenues are $610 Million, Up 13% * Operating Income is $115 Million * OIBDA is $169 Million; 27.7% of Revenues * Net Income is $0.18 per Diluted Share BOSTON, Feb. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, reporting higher revenues, strong storage internal revenue growth and net income for the quarter of $0.18 per diluted share. Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 grew to $610 million, an increase of 13% compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2005. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 11% and service revenues grew 16% compared to the same period in 2005. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, are largely recurring since customers typically retain their records for many years. This marks the 72nd consecutive quarter for which the Company has reported increased storage revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2006, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 10% and 10%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 10%. The total core storage and services revenue internal growth rate was 9% for the quarter. "2006 was another solid year for Iron Mountain, highlighted by strong internal revenue growth rates, particularly in storage revenue, a key driver of our business, as our customer facing investments continue to generate the expected results," stated Richard Reese, the Company's Chairman and CEO. "The opportunities before us are many and we are aggressively investing in those that hold the greatest potential for driving long-term, increasingly profitable growth and ultimately higher shareholder value." Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") was $169 million, or 27.7% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 compared to $149 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. Included in OIBDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 is $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of gains related to the sale of real estate compared to $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $115 million, or 19% of revenues, compared to $97 million, or 18% of revenues, for the same period in 2005. Net income for the quarter was $37 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $26 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. All per share amounts have been restated to reflect the three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on December 29, 2006. Included in net income for the quarter is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling compared to September 30, 2006. Included in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net losses, due mainly to the weakening of the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the Company reported total consolidated revenues of $2.4 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Storage revenues and service revenues grew 12% and 14%, respectively, for the twelve months of 2006 compared to the prior year. For the year, storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 10% and 7%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%. OIBDA was $616 million, or 26.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $574 million, or 27.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in OIBDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 is $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of net gains related primarily to the sale of real estate compared to $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income for the twelve months of 2006 was $407 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $387 million, or 19% of revenues, for 2005. Net income was $129 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for 2006, compared to $111 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for 2005. Included in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, is $12 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of foreign currency related net gains, due mainly to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling, partially offset by charges related to the early extinguishment of debt associated with the Company's financing activities. Included in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, is $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other expense, net comprised almost exclusively of foreign currency related net losses, due primarily to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro offset by the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. In line with its strategy, Iron Mountain acquires attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and service offerings while enhancing its existing operations.

APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments, or FCF FCF is defined as Cash Flows From Operating Activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions): Year Ended December 31, ------------------- 2005 2006 -------- -------- Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Investments $ 120 $ (4) Add: Capital Expenditures, net 244 364 Additions to Customer Acquisition Costs 13 14 Cash Flows From Operating Activities (2) $ 377 $ 374 (2) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
