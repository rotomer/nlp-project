Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports First Quarter 2007 Financial Results * Total revenues up 12% to $633 million driven by strong service revenue growth and the 73rd consecutive quarter of increased storage revenues * OIBDA is $157 million, or 24.8% of revenues; strong performance supported by revenue growth and timing and control of expenses * Operating income is $100 million and net income is up 27% to $35 million or $0.17 per diluted share * The Company raises full year guidance BOSTON, May 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007, reporting strong overall revenue performance, solid operating income and net income for the quarter of $0.17 per diluted share. The Company also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ArchivesOne, Inc., a leading provider of records and information management services in the United States. Strong revenue performance, supported by solid storage revenue growth and robust service revenue growth, highlighted Iron Mountain's financial results for the first quarter of 2007 and was a contributing factor in driving up operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA"). Expense control and the timing of initiative spending were also positive contributors to the Company's operating performance. Iron Mountain was very active in the capital markets in early 2007 as the Company continued the implementation of a multi-phase global treasury program designed to create financial flexibility, reduce foreign exchange risk and drive annual cash savings. In late 2006, the Company established an international treasury center in Switzerland to more effectively and efficiently manage the financing needs of its international subsidiaries outside of North America, initially in Europe. This was followed in the first quarter of 2007 by successful senior subordinated debt offerings in Euros (euro 225 million) and Canadian Dollars (C$175 million). In April 2007, the Company closed on a $900 million global senior credit facility which consolidated its existing senior credit facilities in the U.S. and the U.K. "We are pleased with the performance of the business thus far, as well as the ultimate potential of the markets we serve," said Richard Reese, Chairman and CEO. "Our strong balance sheet will allow us to address an expanding set of growth, productivity and acquisition investment opportunities in the near to medium term. Capitalizing on these opportunities will enhance our ability to drive long term, increasingly profitable growth and therefore, shareholder value." Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 grew to $633 million, an increase of 12% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2006. For the quarter, storage revenues grew 10% and service revenues grew 15% compared to the same period in 2006. For the first quarter of 2007, the storage and service revenue internal growth rates were 9% and 10%, respectively, yielding a total internal revenue growth rate of 9%.
OIBDA was $157 million, or 24.8% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared to $142 million, or 25.2% of revenues, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. See Appendix A at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Operating income for the first quarter of 2007 was $100 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $92 million, or 16% of revenues, for the same period in 2006. Net income for the quarter was $35 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $27 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on December 29, 2006. Included in net income for the quarter of 2007 is $8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised primarily of $9 million of business interruption insurance recoveries related to the London warehouse fire of July 2006, offset by $2 million of early debt extinguishment charges related to our first quarter refinancing activities. Net foreign currency gains for the three months ended March 31, 2007 were negligible. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2006, is $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of other income, net comprised of $1 million of foreign currency related gains and $2 million of other non-operating net gains. The foreign currency related gains were due primarily to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro partially offset by a weakening of the Australian Dollar. Iron Mountain's acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of 2006, the Company completed several small shredding and records management business acquisitions in North America and the U.K. The Company also signed a definitive agreement to acquire ArchivesOne, Inc., a leading provider of records and information management services in the United States and acquired Societa Italiana Archivi s.p.a. in Italy and Gesellschaft fur beleglose Dokumentenbearbeitung gmbh ("GbD") in Germany. The ArchivesOne transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in May 2007. Founded in 1991, ArchivesOne, is a leading records management company based in Middlebury, Connecticut, that serves a customer base of more than 8,500 customers in a variety of sectors including professional services, healthcare, legal and finance. With 31 facilities located in 17 major metropolitan markets in 10 states and the District of Columbia, ArchivesOne will be an important addition to the Company in the U.S. For nearly 15 years Italiana Archivi has been providing records management and DMS solutions to government, finance and other corporate customers throughout Italy. Italiana Archivi gives Iron Mountain a strong national presence in Italy with operations in five major markets: Rome, Venice, Milan, Naples and Aosta. Based in Hamburg, Germany, GbD provides document management solutions specializing in scanning, processing and the subsequent archiving of corporate documents. Iron Mountain was advised exclusively by Lehman Brothers Inc. on the ArchivesOne transaction.

APPENDIX A Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 2007 OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) (1) $142 $157 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 50 57 Operating Income (1) $ 92 $100 Less: Interest Expense, net 47 50 Other (Income), net (3) (8) Provision for Income Taxes 21 22 Minority Interest -- -- Net Income (1) $ 27 $ 35 Major Components of Other (Income) Expense, net: Foreign Currency Exchange Effects: $ (1) $ -- Debt Extinguishment Charges, net: $ -- $ 2 Insurance related gains $ -- $ (9) (1) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments, or FCF FCF is defined as Cash Flows From Operating Activities less capital expenditures (excluding real estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 2007 Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments $(12) $ 33 Add: Capital Expenditures (excluding real estate), net 71 66 Additions to Customer Acquisition Costs 3 3 Cash Flows From Operating Activities (2) $ 62 $102 (2) Columns may not foot due to rounding.
