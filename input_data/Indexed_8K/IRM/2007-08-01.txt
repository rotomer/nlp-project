Iron Mountain Incorporated Reports Second Quarter 2007 Financial Results - The Company exceeds the high end of its forecasted revenue and OIBDA ranges with 15% revenue growth and benefits from expense control; - Revenue performance is driven by strong service revenue growth and the 74th consecutive quarter of increased storage revenues; - Operating income before depreciation and amortization grows 11% to $172 million and net income is $39 million, or $0.19 per diluted share; - The Company raises full year financial outlook to reflect first half performance and the impact of acquisitions. BOSTON, Aug. 1, /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information protection and storage services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, reporting strong revenue growth, higher operating income and earnings of $0.19 per diluted share. Iron Mountain posted solid operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") growth of 11% in the second quarter supported by strong revenue growth and continued overhead expense control. The Company had balanced revenue performance across its North America Physical, International Physical and Worldwide Digital business segments with overall gains supported by robust service revenue growth. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency fluctuations also contributed to overall revenue growth. "We are pleased with the performance of the business this quarter and in the first half of this year," said Richard Reese, Chairman and CEO. "We are delivering solid growth across our portfolio and managing our operations effectively in the face of increasing market demand. We continue to invest in our ability to serve our customers through acquisitions that strengthen our service offerings and expand our global footprint. We are on track to deliver against our strategic objectives this year and are raising our full year financial outlook reflecting this progress." Key Financial Highlights - Q2/2007 Iron Mountain's total consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 15% to $669 million driven by solid internal growth of 10% and augmented by several acquisitions, most notably ArchivesOne and Italiana Archivi, which were first reported during this quarter. The Company's overall revenue growth was highlighted by continued strength in service revenue internal growth (11%) led by increasing special project revenues in both North America and Europe. Solid storage (9%) and core service (8%) internal revenue growth rates were also key factors in the Company's revenue performance for the quarter. OIBDA for the quarter grew 11% to $172 million reflecting the impact of the Company's robust revenue performance and expense control, particularly with regard to overhead spending. Selling, general & administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenues. This improvement partially offset the expected decrease in gross margin resulting from the impact of acquisitions, decreased capacity utilization due to the timing of new real estate and increased real estate taxes and property insurance costs. See Appendix B at the end of this press release for a discussion of OIBDA and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures.
Operating income increased 8% to $111 million, indicative of higher OIBDA and higher depreciation and amortization expense reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. Net income for the quarter was $39 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, including other income, net of $3 million, or $0.01 per share. The components of other income, net, including the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, insurance gains and early debt extinguishment charges are detailed in the table below. Also impacting net income was an increase in interest expense due to additional borrowings for acquisitions and approximately $4 million of reported overlapping interest expense caused by the two-month reporting offset of one of our European subsidiaries as we retired our European senior credit facility. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3% reflecting the positive impacts of the newly created International Treasury Center and the effect of certain foreign currency gains and losses recorded in different tax jurisdictions. Absent the impact of any additional foreign currency rate fluctuations, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 33% for 2007. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on December 29, 2006. The Company's year to date Free Cash Flow before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments ("FCF") for the six months ended June 30, 2007 is $59 million reflecting a 19% increase in cash flows from operating activities, approximately $22 million of insurance proceeds related to the July 2006 warehouse fire in London and controlled capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are expected to increase in the second half of the year. See Appendix B at the end of this press release for a discussion of FCF and the required reconciliation to the appropriate GAAP measures. Acquisitions Iron Mountain's acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Company's geographic footprint and service offerings while enhancing its existing operations. Since the end of the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed several important acquisitions, most notably, the previously announced acquisition of ArchivesOne, Inc., a leading provider of records and information management services in the United States, which closed in May 2007. The Company also acquired a data protection business based in California, a small shredding company in Canada and two small software businesses. Furthering its European expansion strategy, Iron Mountain acquired records management businesses in France, the Netherlands and Ireland. Financial Performance Outlook The Company is raising its financial performance outlook for the full year ending December 31, 2007 to reflect its first half performance and the expected contribution of recently completed acquisitions. In addition, the Company is issuing guidance for the third quarter ending September 30, 2007. The following statements are based on current expectations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions (dollars in millions): Full Year Ending December 31, 2007 Quarter Ending September 30, 2007 Previous Current Low High Low High Low High Revenues $678 $693 $2,600 $ 2,660 $2,660 $2,695 Operating Income 108 115 434 457 434 453 Depreciation & Amortization ~61 231 236 ~240 Capital Expenditures 395 425 395 425 Internal Revenue Growth 8% 10% 8% 10%

APPENDIX B Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization The Company uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA"), an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business. As such, the Company believes OIBDA provides current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. Additionally, the Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of operating income before depreciation and amortization to operating income and net income (in millions): Three Months Ended, Six Months Ended June 30, Ended June 30 2006 2007 2006 2007 OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) $154 $172 $296 $328 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 51 60 101 117 Operating Income $103 $111 $195 $211 Less: Interest Expense, net 47 61 94 112 Other (Income), net (7) (3) (10) (11) Provision for Income Taxes 24 14 45 36 Minority Interest -- -- 1 1 Net Income $38 $39 $65 $74 NOTE: Columns may not foot due to rounding. Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments, or FCF FCF is defined as Cash Flows From Operating Activities less capital expenditures (excluding real estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions): Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 2007 Free Cash Flows Before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments $25 $59 Add: Capital Expenditures (excluding real estate), net 142 139 Additions to Customer Acquisition Costs 7 9 Cash Flows From Operating Activities $174 $207 NOTE: Columns may not foot due to rounding.
