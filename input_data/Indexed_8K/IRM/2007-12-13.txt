Section 2.2. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors may designate from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
 Annual Meeting.
Section 2.3. Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.
 Special Meetings.
Section 2.4. At an annual or special meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been properly brought before such annual or special meeting of stockholders. To be properly brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders, business must be (i) in the case of a special meeting, specified in the notice of the special meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the Board of Directors, or (ii) in the case of an annual meeting, properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder who shall have been a stockholder of record on the record date for such meeting and shall continue to be entitled to vote thereat. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation (A) in the case of an annual meeting that is

called for a date that is within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders, not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date the Corporation's proxy statement was mailed to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, and (B) in the case of an annual meeting that is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, not later than the later of (x) the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or (y) the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made.
th
           In order to be effective, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before an annual meeting of stockholders (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and, if a specific action is to be proposed, the text of the resolution(s) which the proposing stockholder proposes that the stockholders adopt, (ii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, including the class and number of shares of such stock that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to bring the business specified in the notice before the meeting, (iii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal, (iv) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by any stockholders known by the proposing stockholder to be supporting such proposal on the date of such stockholder's notice, (v) whether such stockholder intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under these Bylaws and applicable law to carry the proposal (an affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice"), and (vi) any material interest of the stockholder in such proposal.
If the stockholder has provided the Corporation with a Solicitation Notice, such stockholder must have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry such proposal. If no Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this Section, the stockholder proposing such business must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this Section.
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.4. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that any item of proposed business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
The foregoing requirements shall be in addition to any other requirements imposed by applicable law or regulation.
Section 2.5. (a) Written or printed notice of every meeting of stockholders, annual or special, stating the hour, date and place thereof, and the purpose or purposes in general terms for which the meeting is called shall, not less than ten (10) days, or such longer period as shall be provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or otherwise, and not more than sixty (60) days before such meeting, be served upon or mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, at the address of such stockholder as it appears upon the stock records of the Corporation or, if such stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices be mailed to some other address, then to the address designated in such request.
 Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice.
 
-2-
 
(b) A written waiver of any such notice signed by the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not validly called or convened. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
 Section 2.6. . Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Law"), the  Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
Notice by Electronic Transmission
 Section 2.7. . An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
Definition of Electronic Transmission
Section 2.8. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or these bylaws and subject to the Delaware Law, the presence, in person or by proxy, at any meeting of stockholders of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation issued, outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall be requisite and shall constitute a quorum. If one or
 Quorum and Adjournments.
more classes of stock are entitled to vote as separate classes upon any question, then, in the case of such class, a quorum for the consideration of such question shall, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, consist of a majority of the voting power of all stock of that class issued, outstanding and entitled to vote. If a majority of the voting power of shares of capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat or, where a larger quorum is required, such quorum, shall not be represented at any meeting of the stockholders regularly called, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat shall have power to adjourn the meeting to another time, or to another time and place, without notice other than announcement of adjournment at the meeting, and there may be successive adjournments for like cause and in like manner until the requisite amount of shares entitled to vote at such meeting shall be represented; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, notice of the hour, date and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
 
-3-
 
stockholder entitled to vote thereat. Subject to the requirements of the Delaware Law and the Certificate of Incorporation, on any issue on which one or more classes of stock are entitled to vote separately, no adjournment shall be taken with respect to any class for which a quorum is present unless the Chairman of the meeting otherwise directs. At any meeting held to consider matters which were subject to adjournment for want of a quorum at which the requisite amount of shares entitled to vote shall be represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
Section 2.9. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to the Delaware Law, at each meeting of stockholders, every stockholder of record at the closing of the transfer books, if closed, or on the date set by the Board of Directors for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in such stockholder's name on the books of the Corporation on such date.
 Votes; Proxies.
At each such meeting every stockholder entitled to vote shall be entitled to do so in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing or as otherwise permitted by law subscribed by such stockholder and bearing a date not more than three (3) years prior to the meeting in question, unless said instrument provides for a longer period during which it is to remain in force. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or any interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation an instrument in writing or as otherwise permitted by law revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, except as otherwise provided by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the Chairman of the meeting or by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting. If it is required or determined that inspectors of election be appointed, the Chairman shall appoint one or more inspectors of election, who shall first take and subscribe an oath or affirmation faithfully to execute the duties of inspectors at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability. The inspector(s) so appointed shall take charge of the polls and, after the balloting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken. No director or candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as such inspector.
At any meeting at which a quorum is present, a plurality of the votes properly cast for election to the Board of Directors shall be sufficient to elect a candidate to the Board of Directors, and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any other question shall decide the question, except in
any case where a larger vote is required by the Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or otherwise.
Section 2.10. The Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or in his or her absence the Vice Chairman, or in the absence of a Vice Chairman, the President, or in the absence of the President, a Vice President, shall call meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman thereof. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, and, in his or her absence, the presiding officer may appoint a secretary.
 Organization.
Section 3.1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be conducted and managed by a Board of Directors, none of whom needs to be a stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by the Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
 General Powers; Number and Term of Office.
 
-4-
 
Bylaws, the number of directors shall be fixed by the Board of Directors (and not by the stockholders) from time to time, in each case by a vote of a majority of the directors in office at the time, regardless of whether such majority constitutes a quorum, provided that no decrease shall affect the term of any director then in office. If the number is not so fixed at any meeting or after an event giving rise to a vacancy, the number shall remain as it stood immediately prior to such meeting or event. The number of directors shall not be less than three.
Section 3.2.Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a meeting of stockholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or a committee of Directors appointed by the Board, or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who shall have been a stockholder of record on the record date for such meeting and shall continue to be entitled to vote thereat who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.2. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting that is called for a date that is within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders, not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the Anniversary, and (ii) in the case of an annual meeting that is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, or in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing Directors, not later than the later of (x) the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or (y) the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made; such time periods shall be subject to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provision thereto, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, in the event that the

provided, however,
number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of the stockholders is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of notice for the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, at least one hundred (100) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 3.2 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
In order to be effective, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person on the date of such stockholder's notice and (d) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (a) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, including the class and number of shares of such stock that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such stockholder and any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominee(s), (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by any other
 
-5-
 
stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominee(s) on the date of such stockholder's notice, (d) a Solicitation Notice or a statement that the stockholder does not intend to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a sufficient number of holders of the Corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees, and (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder.
If the stockholder has provided the Corporation with a Solicitation Notice, such stockholder must, at least fifteen days prior to the date of such meeting, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a percentage of the Corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder. If no Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this Section 3.2, the stockholder proposing such nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this Section 3.2.
The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
The foregoing requirements shall be in addition to any other requirements imposed by applicable law or regulation.
Section 3.3. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office by the stockholders in the
Removal.
manner provided in this Section 3.3. At any special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the notice of which shall state that the removal of a director or directors is among the purposes of the meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors generally, voting together as a single class, may remove such director or directors with or without cause.
Section 3.4. If any vacancy shall occur among the directors, or if the number of directors shall at any time be increased, such vacancy shall be filled only by the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, by a majority vote of the directors then in office or by the sole remaining director, or, only if no directors then remain, by the stockholders of the Corporation.
Vacancies.
Section 3.5. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or by the President, and as may be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of any meeting. Meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or the President or a majority of the directors in office by personal oral communication, telephonic oral communication, telecopy or electronic transmission, or written notice, duly served or sent or mailed to each director not less than twenty-four (24) hours before such meeting, except that, if mailed, not less than seventy-two (72) hours before such meeting.
Meetings.
Meetings may be held at any time and place without notice if all the directors are present and do not object to the holding of such meeting for lack of proper notice or if those not present shall, in writing or by telecopy or electronic transmission, waive notice thereof before or after the meeting. A regular meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders at the place where such meeting is held. Regular meetings of the Board may also be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board.

Except as otherwise provided by the Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
Section 3.6. Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of such Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of video conference, telephone conference or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

Quorum and Adjournment.
Section 3.9. Directors may receive compensation for their services, as such, and for service on any committee of the Board of Directors, as fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and for expenses of attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee thereof.

Compensation.

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation
Section 12.3. Any indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the person requesting such is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 12.1 or 12.2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors, by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (whether or not a quorum), (b) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors (whether or not a quorum), (c) if there are no disinterested directors or if a majority of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that any person referred to in Section 12.1 or 12.2 has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to therein or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.
