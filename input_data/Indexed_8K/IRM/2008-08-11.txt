For the avoidance of doubt, Executives provision of an oral or written reference to a prospective employer of an Iron Mountain employee or consultant upon request of such employee or consultant so long as Executive is not affiliated in any way with the entity to which the reference is addressed shall not, in and of itself, be a violation of this Section 7(c).
