This annual gathering of Company management, investors and Wall Street analysts features management presentations covering a variety of important topics related to the Company's strategy, execution and financial performance. The company described the large and expanding market opportunities in the information protection and storage services industry and reviewed their operating and financial strategies aimed at capitalizing on these opportunities. The Company reinforced its long-term financial goals and objectives and also provided an outlook on full year 2008 and 2009 financial performance. The Company is reiterating its revenue and OIBDA guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2008 and lowering its capital spending outlook. This guidance is based on current expectations and does not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. For the full year ending December 31, 2008, the Company expects the following (dollars in millions): Full Year Ending December 31, 2008 --------------------------------------------- Previous Current ------------------- ------------------ Low High Low High ------------------- ------------------ Revenues $3,050 $3,090 $3,050 $3,090 Operating Income 478 498 478 498 Depreciation & Amortization ~295 ~295 Capital Expenditures 440 480 ~440 Internal Revenue Growth 7% 9% 7% 9% --more--
Iron Mountain Incorporated Hosts 11th Annual Investor Day / page 2 Within the framework of its long-term financial strategy, Iron Mountain issued its preliminary outlook for its 2009 financial performance. For its full year 2009, the Company expects the following: o Total revenues in the range of $3,180 million to $3,260 million; o Operating income between $490 million and $530 million; o Depreciation and amortization of approximately $330 million; o Capital expenditures of approximately $480 million; and o Total revenue internal growth rate between 7% and 9%. The above outlook incorporates projected impacts from recent changes in foreign exchange rates. The company currently estimates that the foreign exchange will lower reported revenue and OIBDA growth by about 3% in 2009. The preliminary guidance also does not include any projected impact from future acquisitions and any potential expenses associated with future acquisitions that would need to be reported under SFAS 141R. The company estimates that acquisitions completed to date in 2008 will have limited net impact on 2009 results, given offsetting effects from the divestiture of the company's product sales business. In order to further enhance the overall quality of its investor communications, the Company will make an audiocast of its Investor Day presentation available on its website (www.ironmountain.com). Please check the website for details regarding the timing of the posting of the audiocast.
