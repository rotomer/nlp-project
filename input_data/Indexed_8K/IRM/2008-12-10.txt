Amendments to Option Plans
On December 4, 2008, Iron Mountain Incorporated (the Company) amended each of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, the Iron Mountain Incorporated 1997 Stock Option Plan, the LiveVault Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the Stratify, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (each a Plan and, collectively, the Plans) to provide that any unvested options and other awards granted under the respective Plan shall vest immediately should an employee be terminated by the Company, or terminate his or her own employment for Good Reason (as defined in each Plan), in connection with a Vesting Change in Control (as defined in each Plan).  The definition of Good Reason includes a diminution in an employees total annual compensation, a material diminution in the benefits an employee is eligible to receive and certain relocations.  The definition of Vesting Change In Control includes (a) when any person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; (b) a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other third party, unless the Companys stockholders continue to own at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the entity surviving such merger or consolidation, (c) the sale or disposition of the Company of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, and (d) certain changes in the Board of Directors of the Company.  Copies of the amendments are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and are incorporated herein by reference.
Change in Control Agreements
On December 10, 2008, the Company entered into Change in Control Agreements with each of Robert T. Brennan and Brian P. McKeon (each an Officer) in order to provide an additional element of the definition of Good Reason that could result in an acceleration of such Officers options if he were to terminate his employment following a Vesting Change in Control.  That additional element is a material diminution in the responsibilities or title of such Officers position with the Company and/or the assignment to such Officer of duties and responsibilities that are generally inconsistent with the Officers position with the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Copies of the agreements are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.5 and 10.6 and are incorporated herein by reference.
