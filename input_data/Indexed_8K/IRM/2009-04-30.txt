FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in information management services, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, announcing strong operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, on a reported basis. Excluding impacts from asset gains and losses, OIBDA and operating income grew 9% compared to the first quarter of 2008. These results were supported by solid core revenue internal growth of 7%, which more than offset forecasted weakness in complementary service internal revenue growth. As expected, significantly weakened foreign currencies led by the British pound and the Canadian dollar reduced the Companys reported revenue and OIBDA by 7% and 9%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2008.  Driven by a significant increase in cash flows from operations and modest capital expenditures, the Company ended the quarter with excellent liquidity comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility of more than $830 million.
BOSTON  April 30, 2009
Iron Mountains business is healthy and performing as expected, said Bob Brennan, President and CEO.  Our disciplined management approach and focus on execution, particularly in our North American Physical segment, is driving solid core revenue and OIBDA growth.  Our complementary revenue streams, which represent less than 15% of total revenues, were pressured as expected by economic conditions. Despite these impacts, we delivered strong results in the first quarter supported by continued productivity gains and disciplined cost management.  We are raising our 2009 OIBDA guidance and lowering our capital spending outlook reflecting our continued progress on these fronts.
Iron Mountain reported total internal revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter supported by core revenue internal growth of 7%.  Solid core revenue internal growth was reported across all business segments  the North American Physical, International Physical and Worldwide Digital business segments.  As expected, complementary service revenues decreased year-over-year, due primarily to the completion of a large special project in Europe, lower recycled paper prices and softness in the more discretionary revenues such as project revenues, fulfillment services and software license sales. OIBDA of $197 million for the quarter exceeded the Companys forecasted range due to  higher gross profit margins and continued focus on overhead cost controls. Included in OIBDA for the first quarter of 2009 is a benefit of $5 million resulting from certain vehicle leases being classified as capital leases in 2009.  These leases previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases. This benefit was included in the guidance originally issued by the Company on February 26, 2009.  See the appendices at the end of this press release for Selected Financial Data, a discussion of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding the Companys results.

Net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated (see Appendix A below) for the quarter was $29 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, driven by higher operating income and reduced interest expense.  Earnings were again impacted by the continued weakening of the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter, which resulted in a net $7 million charge in other expense as the Company marked its foreign currency forward contracts and non-U.S. dollar denominated third party and intercompany debt to market.  This net expense includes both foreign currency gains and losses, which are incurred in different tax jurisdictions.  As a result, the Company recorded a $5 million tax provision.  For the quarter, these charges impacted earnings by $0.06 per diluted share.
Key Financial Highlights  Q1 2009
Iron Mountain reported total consolidated revenues of $723 million for the quarter compared to $749 million for the prior year period.  Internal revenue growth was 4% as expected.  Core revenue internal growth was 7% supported by solid storage revenue growth in the North American Physical business and higher core service internal growth in the international and digital businesses.  The overall internal growth rate was impacted by the continued softness in complementary service revenues as discussed above. Significantly weakened foreign currencies including the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro reduced the revenue growth rate by 7% compared to the first quarter of 2008.
The Company reported gross profits of $406 million with its gross profit margin improving from 53.6% in the first quarter of 2008 to 56.2% in the first quarter of 2009.  Gross margins were supported by productivity gains and improved storage gross margins in North America. Gross margins also benefited from the sale of the low margin data product sales business in June 2008 and from the recharacterization of certain vehicle leases as described above.  These benefits more than offset the impact of expenses associated with the planned real estate moves in the United Kingdom.
OIBDA for the quarter was $197 million.  OIBDA (excluding asset gains and losses) grew 9% compared to the first quarter of 2008 including 3% growth from the recharacterization of certain vehicle leases.  Excluding the impacts of the foreign currency exchange rate changes and the lease recharacterization, OIBDA (excluding asset gains and losses) grew approximately 15%. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 5% in the quarter.  Excluding the impacts of the foreign currency exchange rate changes, these overhead costs increased 1%, below the rate of internal revenue growth reflecting disciplined cost management.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2009 was $121 million, up 14% compared to the same period in 2008.  Excluding the impact of asset gains and losses, operating income increased 9% reflecting the flow through of OIBDA gains.  Net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated for the quarter was $29 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, including other expense of $7 million, driven primarily by foreign currency rate fluctuations.
The Companys effective tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items for the quarter was approximately 39%. The net tax impact of the foreign currency rate fluctuations described above added 13% and other discrete items added another 2% to the effective tax rate in the quarter.

Capital expenditures incurred in the first quarter of 2009 totaled $49 million, or 6.8% of revenues, excluding $2 million for the purchase of real estate.  This is consistent with the same measure for 2008 as the Company maintained tight control over capital spending to improve capital efficiency.  The Company has refined its 2009 capital spending plans and now expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $380 million for the year, $40 million below its prior full year outlook.
The Companys Free Cash Flow before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments (FCF) for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $57 million.  Higher cash flows from operating activities compared to the comparable prior year period, including a $15 million cash gain on the settlement of a foreign currency forward contract, and controlled capital expenditures drove this improvement.  As a result of the increase in FCF and low level of acquisition spending in the quarter, the Company further improved its liquidity position.  As of March 31, 2009, the Company had more than $830 million of liquidity including cash of $272 million and availability under its revolving credit facility of $560 million.  Further, the Companys consolidated leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA (as defined by its senior credit facility) decreased from 3.8 times at December 31, 2008 to 3.6 times at March 31, 2009, well below the covenant limitation of 5.5 times included in its senior credit facility.  The decrease illustrates the Companys ability to naturally reduce its consolidated leverage ratio in the absence of significant acquisition activity.
Acquisitions
The Company has not completed any acquisitions since the end of 2008.  Iron Mountains acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring attractive businesses that provide a strong platform for future growth by expanding the Companys geographic footprint and service offerings while enhancing its existing operations.
Financial Performance Outlook
For 2009, the Company continues to target solid underlying operating performance supported by solid core revenue growth and sustained progress in the North American Physical business segment through an ongoing focus on execution.  The Company is reaffirming its full year outlook for 5%-7% internal revenue growth.  Based on strong first quarter 2009 operating performance, the Company is raising its 2009 OIBDA guidance range by $20MM and now expects 11%-16% OIBDA (excluding asset gains and losses) growth before the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations.  The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies is expected to lower results reported in U.S. dollars by approximately 7% in 2009. The Companys guidance for the second quarter of 2009 set forth below includes a reduction of about 8% in both revenue growth and OIBDA (excluding asset gains and losses) growth driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar.  In 2008, primarily due to a softening vehicle resale market, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases are now classified as capital leases.  As a result, 2009 rent expense is expected to decrease by approximately $21 million with an offsetting increase to depreciation expense and interest expense.  We expect this change to provide a 3% benefit to the companys full year OIBDA (excluding asset gains and losses) growth rate. This guidance is based on current expectations and does not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions (dollars in millions):

New Presentation of Net Income and Minority Interest :
(millions)
Effective January 1, 2009, Iron Mountain adopted SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment to ARB 51 (SFAS 160).  Among other things, SFAS 160 requires a change in the way minority interest and net income are presented on the face of the statement of operations.  The table above shows the required presentation for the three month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2009.  Please refer to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to SFAS 160.
APPENDIX B
Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization
Iron Mountain uses Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (OIBDA) as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems, to evaluate the operating performance of the consolidated business.  The Company uses multiples of current and projected OIBDA in conjunction with its discounted cash flow models to determine its overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets.  The Company believes OIBDA and OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding its ability to generate cash flow to support business investment and its ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses.  OIBDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Following is a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income and net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated (in millions):

Constant Currency Growth Rates
Iron Mountain conducts business in 39 countries on five continents.  As such, a considerable amount of its revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies.  In 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against most major foreign currencies.  As such, the Companys international results were reduced when translated into U.S. dollars.  The table above shows the growth rates of certain operating statement line items on an as reported basis as well as on a constant currency basis.  The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2008 results at the 2009 average exchange rates.
 
Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments, or FCF
FCF is defined as Cash Flows from Operating Activities less capital expenditures (excluding real estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer acquisition costs.  Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business.  FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures (both growth and maintenance) and our customer acquisition costs.  As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors.  FCF should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments to Cash Flows from Operating Activities (in millions):
