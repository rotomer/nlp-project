(dd)        
The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that complies with the requirements of the Exchange Act and has been designed by the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting was, as of December 31, 2008, effective, and based on work completed to date in the ordinary course of business, the Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.  Since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus
, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either (A) the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or (B) in any other materials or information provided to investors by, or with the written approval of, the Company in connection with the Offering, including any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically), including any Issuer Written Communication ("") or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any "issuer information," or in any Marketing Materials, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (and, in all cases except with respect to the Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading

; that neither the Company nor the Guarantors will be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 7(d).  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, including
provided, however,
but not limited to other liability
under this Agreement.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(and, in all cases except with respect to the Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made)

statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you specifically for use therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 7(d).  This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have, including
but not limited to other liability
under this Agreement.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this Section 7).  In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties) or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleading parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or reasonably could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
 
(d)           The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that the statements with respect to the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the third and sixth paragraphs of the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or any Guarantor
by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
8.             .  In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting, in the case of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses suffered by the Company and the Guarantors any contribution received by the Company and the Guarantors from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company and the Guarantors) as incurred to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of each of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Contribution
Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and the directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Guarantors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise.  The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, as the case may be, shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.
 
9.             .
Default by an Underwriter
 
(a)           If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "") and such Defaulted Notes do not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then each non-defaulting Underwriter shall purchase an aggregate amount of the Defaulted Notes equal to the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth opposite such Underwriter's name on Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased by all non-defaulting Underwriters.
Defaulted Notes
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Defaulted Notes equal or exceed in the aggregate 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right, within 48 hours after the previously scheduled Closing Date, to make arrangements for one or more of such non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon among such non-defaulting Underwriters and upon the terms herein set forth; that if the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements within such 48-hour period, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company and the Guarantors.
provided
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 9 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, any of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
10.           .  All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 5, the indemnity agreements contained in Section 7 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 8, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantors, any of their respective officers and directors or any controlling person thereof, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes to and by the Underwriters.  The representations contained in Section 1 and the agreements contained in Sections 5, 7, 8 and 11(d) hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 9 or 11 hereof.

11.   The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, will not (i) violate the provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the Delaware Guarantors or (ii) violate any present statute, rule or regulation promulgated by the State of Delaware and New York that is normally applicable both to general business corporations that are not engaged in regulated business activities and to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, the Indenture, the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Law").

Form of Opinion of Company's General Counsel

The statements under the captions "Executive Compensation" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" in the Company's Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of shareholders held on June 4, 2009, and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings;
 
2.     The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with all the provisions thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body (except as such may be required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states or the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States), and will not conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or a default under, the charter or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective property is bound, or violate or conflict with any laws, administrative regulations or rulings or court decrees applicable to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective property;
 
3.     I do not know of (i) any legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their respective property is subject that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and is not so described, or (ii) any contract or other document that is required to be described in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and is not so described or so filed;

has occurred which allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Permit, except as in each case as would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect (financial or otherwise) on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, except as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, such Permits contain no restrictions that materially interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as currently conducted.

In our capacity as the Connecticut Guarantors' special counsel we have reviewed the documents listed in , attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The documents listed in , inclusive, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "."
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
Documents
 
This opinion is based entirely on our review of the Documents.  We have made no other documentary review or investigation of any kind whatsoever for purposes of this opinion.
 
For purposes of this opinion we have assumed the genuineness of all other signatures, (other than on behalf of the Connecticut Guarantors) the genuiness of all documents reviewed by us that are presented to us as either originals or copies, the authenticity and completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original or copy form and the legal competence of each individual executing any document.  We have also assumed that each Note conforms to the form thereof as examined by us, and the Supplemental Indenture conforms to the description thereof in the Prospectus Supplement (defined below).  We have relied, as to certain factual matters, upon representations of the Connecticut Guarantors in the Documents, upon certificates or representations of the owner trustees of the 98 Trust, 99 Trust and 2001 Trust, respectively, and upon certificates of public officials, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy and completeness of such certificates and representations.
 
We have assumed for purposes of this opinion that the Company and Trustee are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws
of their respective jurisdictions of organization, and are duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture.  W
e have also assumed that the Company and Trustee have all requisite organizational and legal power and authority to execute, deliver and perform their obligations under the Indenture, and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby,
that the Company and Trustee are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,
that the Company and Trustee have duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture,
and that the Indenture is and will be the valid and binding agreement of the Company and Trustee, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms
.
 
We assume you know and understand that we represent the Connecticut Guarantors only, that we do not represent the Company, and although we have represented the Connecticut Guarantors from time to time in connection with various matters, we do not act as general counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors.  Further, we are not necessarily familiar with the day-to-day operations of any of the Connecticut Guarantors.  There may be other matters that are handled by other counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors, with respect to which we have not been consulted and of which we have no knowledge.
 
This opinion is limited solely to the laws of the State of Connecticut, as applied by courts located in the State of Connecticut.  To the extent that the foregoing laws may apply to or govern the transactions described above, we express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws.  The opinions expressed below, insofar as they relate to the good standing of the Connecticut Guarantors under the laws of the State of Connecticut, are based solely on certificates from the Connecticut Secretary of State.  For purposes of the opinions set forth herein, we have assumed, with your permission, that the laws of the State of Connecticut will apply to all transactions, agreements and matters set forth herein.
 
In rendering this opinion we assume that the execution of all documents on behalf of all entities and persons other than the Connecticut Guarantors was duly authorized and that such documents were validly executed and delivered on behalf of such entities and persons.
 
Our opinion is further subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and assumptions:
(a)           We express no opinion on the enforceability of the Indenture, as it relates to any party other than the Connecticut Guarantors;
 
(b)           The transactions described in the Indenture, Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated July 19, 2007 relating to the Registration Statement (the "") and the final prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus dated August 5, 2009 (the "", and together with the Base Prospectus collectively the "") may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, marshaling or other laws and rules of law affecting the enforcement generally of creditors' rights and remedies (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers of debtors' or guarantors' rights); and we express no opinion as to the status under any fraudulent conveyance laws or fraudulent transfer laws of any of the obligations of, or any security interest granted by the Connecticut Guarantors, or any other person, whether under the Indenture or otherwise;

(c)           The transaction described in the Indenture, Registration Statement and Prospectus may be subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and will be subject to a duty to act in a commercially reasonable manner. We have assumed that, in connection with any proceeding all parties will act in good faith, with diligence and in compliance with statutory requirements;
 
(d)           We express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring, circumstances arising, or changes of law becoming effective or occurring, after the date hereof on the matters addressed in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to inform you of additional or changed facts, or changes in law, of which we may become aware;
 
(e)           We express no opinion with respect to any matter involving financial information or relating to compliance with financial covenants or financial requirements; and
 
(f)            The opinions set forth below do not apply to the extent that judicial decisions may permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify the terms or the interpretation of any of the documents or agreements identified herein, or to the extent that judicial decisions may make certain provisions of agreements unenforceable where their enforcement would violate the implied covenant of fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable, or where their breach is not material.
 
Based on the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, and subject to the qualifications and exceptions herein contained, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.     Each of the Connecticut Guarantors is a Connecticut statutory trust, and duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut.
2.     Upon execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture and the guaranties executed by the Connecticut Guarantors (collectively the ""), such Guaranties shall have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of them.

3.     Upon execution and delivery of the Guaranties, such Guaranties shall constitute validly issued and binding obligations of the Connecticut Guarantors, enforceable against the respective Connecticut Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinions above relate only to laws and regulations, and consents, approvals, actions and filings required thereunder, which in our experience, are normally applicable to companies in the type of business engaged in by the Connecticut Guarantors.  Moreover, we express no opinion as to any consent, approval, action or filing, or violation of law, (i) which may be required as a result of your involvement in the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement or Prospectus because of your legal or regulatory status or because of any other facts specifically pertaining to you; or (ii) which, under Connecticut's blue-sky laws, could be readily obtained without significant delay or expense to you, without loss to you of any material benefit under the Indenture or Prospectus and without any material adverse effect on you or the Connecticut Guarantors during the period such consent, approval, action or filing was not obtained or effected.
 
We render or imply no opinion with respect to compliance with any federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, including without limitation, those relating to registration, filing, anti-fraud, or which relate to the accuracy or completeness of disclosure.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of Connecticut and we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of Connecticut.
 
We are not opining on specialized laws relating to tax, insolvency, antitrust, pension, employee benefit, environmental, intellectual property, banking, insurance, labor, health and safety and securities laws.  We are also not opining on federal law or the law of any county, municipality or other political subdivision or local governmental agency or authority.
 
We undertake no obligation to advise you of facts or changes in law occurring after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
 
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely in connection with the transactions under the Indenture and Prospectus.  You may not rely on this opinion letter in any other connection.  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company of even date herewith, which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to references to this firm under the caption "Validity of the Offered Securities" in the Base Prospectus and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement.
