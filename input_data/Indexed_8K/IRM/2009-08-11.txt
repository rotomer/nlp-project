Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation.
 
On August 10, 2009, the Company completed its offering of $550,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 8-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the "Notes") pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in, an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of August 5, 2009, among the Company, the Guarantors named therein, and Barclays Capital Inc.,
Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, RBS Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
, as underwriters.  The Notes were issued under a Senior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 30, 2002 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the Eighth Supplemental Indenture (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), dated as of August 10, 2009, by and among the Company, the Guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture").   The description of the Notes in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture and the form of note included therein.  A copy of the Base Indenture was filed as Exhibit 4.7 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a copy of the Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company will pay 8-3/8% interest per annum on the principal amount of the Notes, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  Interest will accrue from August 10, 2009 and the first interest payment date will be February 15, 2010.  The Notes will mature on August 15, 2021, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.  The Notes were issued at a price to public of 99.625% of par value.
 
The Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by substantially all of the Company's direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The Notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank behind all of the Company's and its subsidiary guarantors' current and future senior indebtedness and equally with the Company's and its subsidiary guarantors' current and future senior subordinated indebtedness and trade payables.
 
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to August 15, 2014 at the make-whole price set forth in the Indenture and at any time after August 15, 2014 at the prices set forth in the Indenture.  Prior to August 15, 2012, the Company may redeem a portion of the outstanding Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings as long as at least $357.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding immediately afterwards. If the Company sells certain assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, it must offer to repurchase the Notes at the prices set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture provides for customary "events of default" which could cause, or permit, the acceleration of the Notes.  Those are similar to the events of default with respect to the Company's other senior subordinated notes.  Under the terms of the Indenture the Company is also subject to financial covenants and restrictions which are substantially similar to those applicable to the Company's other senior subordinated notes.
 
Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
Notice of Redemption with respect to the 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013
 
On August 10, 2009 the Company delivered a notice of redemption to the trustee with respect to its 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "8-5/8% Notes").  The notice of redemption provided the trustee with notice that the Company intends to redeem all of the $447.9 million of aggregate principal amount of 8-5/8% Notes outstanding.  Upon mailing of the call notice by the trustee to holders in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the 8-5/8% Notes were issued, the 8-5/8% Notes became irrevocably due and payable on September 9, 2009 (the "Redemption Date") and at the redemption price set forth in the call notice.  The 8-5/8% Notes will be redeemed with the proceeds from the sale of the Notes.  On the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, all rights of holders with respect to t he 8-5/8% Notes will terminate except for the right to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender for redemption.
 
The redemption of the 8-5/8% Notes will be made only by means of the call notice mailed by the trustee.  This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute a notice of redemption of the 8-5/8% Notes.

Asset Sale Offers
.
 
In the event that the Company shall commence an Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Section 4.17 hereof, it shall follow the procedures specified below:
 
The Asset Sale Offer shall remain open for 20 Business Days after the Commencement Date relating to such Asset Sale Offer, except to the extent required to be extended by applicable law (as so extended, the "Offer Period").  No later than one Business Day after the termination of the Offer Period (the "Purchase Date"), the Company shall purchase the principal amount (the "Offer Amount") of Notes required to be purchased in such Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 4.17 hereof or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer.
 
If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any interest accrued to such Purchase Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest shall be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.
 
On the Commencement Date of any Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall send or cause to be sent, by first class mail, a notice to each of the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee.  Such notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable the Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer and shall state:
 
(1)
          
that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 3.9 and Section 4.17 hereof and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer shall remain open;
 
(2)
          
the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;
 
(3)
          
that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment shall continue to accrue interest;
 
(4)
          
that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;
 
(5)
          
that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Company, a depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Purchase Date;
 
(6)
          
that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, depositary or Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the close of business on the Business Day preceding the termination of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal
amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing such Holder's election to have the Note purchased;
 
(7)
          
that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased on a basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed to be appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in denominations of $2,000, or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, shall be purchased); and
pro rata
 
(8)
          
that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.
 
On or before 12:00 noon on each Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent in immediately available funds the aggregate purchase price with respect to a principal amount of Notes equal to the Offer Amount, together with accrued interest thereon, to be held for payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9.  On such Purchase Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment, on a basis to the extent necessary, an aggregate principal amount equal to the Offer Amount of Notes and other notes (in accordance with the terms of Section 4.17 of the Indenture) tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes and such other notes or portions thereof tendered, (ii) deliver or cause the Paying Agent or depositary, as the case may be, to deliver to the Trustee Notes so accepted and (iii) deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9.  The Company, depositary or Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than three Business Days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price with respect to the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note, to such Holder, equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of such Holder's Notes surrendered.  Any Note not accepted in the Asset Sale Offer shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof.  The Company shall publicly announce in a newspaper of general circulation the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date.
pro rata
 
The Asset Sale Offer shall be made by the Company in compliance with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, to the extent applicable, and all other applicable federal and state securities laws.
 
Each purchase pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.6 hereof to the extent applicable.
 
In the event the amount of Excess Proceeds to be applied to an Asset Sale Offer would result in the purchase of a principal amount of Notes which is not evenly divisible by $1,000, the Trustee shall promptly refund to the Company the portion of such Excess Proceeds that is not necessary to purchase the immediately lesser principal amount of Notes that is so divisible.

With respect to the Notes issued under this Eighth Supplemental Indenture, Sections 2.6(a) through 2.6(l) are added to Article IV of the Indenture.
 
  (a)
        
Restricted Payments
.
 
4.8.    The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:
Restricted Payments
.
 
(1)
          
declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or dividends or distributions payable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);
 
(2)
          
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Company (other than any such Equity Interests owned by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);
 
(3)
          
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire prior to scheduled maturity for value any Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; or
 
(4)
          
make any Investment other than a Permitted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments");
 
unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:
 
(i)
           
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;
 
(ii)
          
the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of Section 4.9 of the Indenture; and
 
(iii)
         
such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the 1996 Indenture Date is less than (x) the cumulative EBITDA of the Company, minus 1.75 times the cumulative Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company, in each case for the period (taken as one accounting period) from June 30, 1996, to the end of the Company's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, plus (y) the aggregate net Equity Proceeds received by the Company from the issuance or sale since the 1996 Indenture Date of Equity Interests of the Company or of debt securities of the Company that have been converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests or convertible debt securities sold to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and other than Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock), plus (z) $2.0 million.
 
The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:
 
(1)
          
the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;
 
(2)
          
the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Stock);
 
(3)
          
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock);
 
(4)
          
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issue and sale (other than to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Refinancing Indebtedness;
 
(5)
          
the repurchase of any Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions similar to the covenant set forth in Section 4.18 of the Indenture, provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such repurchase the Company has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such Change of Control Offer; and
 
(6)
          
additional payments to current or former employees or directors of the Company for repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests, provided that the aggregate amount of all such payments under this clause (6) does not exceed $0.5 million in any year and $2.0 million in the aggregate.
 
The Restricted Payments described in clauses (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph but shall reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section, and the Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) and (4) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph and shall not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
 
If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision shall be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in the Company's EBITDA; , , that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of
provided
however
 
all Restricted Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such Investment.  In addition, for the avoidance of doubt and to avoid double counting, if an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, then the subsequent assignment, contribution, distribution or other transfer of such Investment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be considered a new Investment or Restricted Payment and shall not further reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
 
If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments.
 
For the purpose of making any Restricted Payment calculations under the Indenture:
 
(1)
          
Investments shall include the fair market value of the net assets of any Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary and shall exclude the fair market value of the net assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case with fair market value determined by the Board of Directors in good faith and, for the avoidance of doubt, such inclusions and exclusions will not be limited by the amount of any Investment or aggregate Investments;
 
(2)
          
any asset or property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be valued at fair market value at the time of such transfer, provided that, in each case, the fair market value of an asset or property is as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith and, for the avoidance of doubt, the fair market value (as so determined) of such asset of property shall be subtracted from (in the case of a transfer to an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or added to (in the case of a transfer from an Unrestricted Subsidiary) the calculation under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section; and
 
(3)
          
subject to the foregoing, the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, shall be determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive.
 
The Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with Section 4.15 of the Indenture.  Upon such designation, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this Section 4.8.  Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
 
  (b)
        
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock

4.9.    The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guaranty or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Company shall not permit any of its Restricted
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
.
Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; , that the Company may incur Indebtedness and may permit a Restricted Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness if at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto the Leverage Ratio would be less than 6.5 to 1.0.
provided, however
 
The foregoing limitations shall not apply to:
 
(1)
          
the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Senior Bank Debt in an aggregate amount not to exceed $790.0 million at any one time outstanding;
 
(2)
          
the issuance by the Restricted Subsidiaries of Subsidiary Guarantees;
 
(3)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;
 
(4)
          
the issuance by the Company of the Notes;
 
(5)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Lease Obligations and/or additional Indebtedness constituting purchase money obligations up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding, provided that the Liens securing such Indebtedness constitute Permitted Liens;
 
(6)
          
the incurrence of Indebtedness between (i) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(7)
          
Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business, , in the case of Hedging Obligations with respect to Indebtedness, that such Indebtedness is permitted to be outstanding by the terms of the Indenture;
provided
 
(8)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising out of letters of credit, performance bonds, surety bonds and bankers' acceptances incurred in the ordinary course of business up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding;
 
(9)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting of guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of Capital Stock;
 
(10)
        
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Refinancing Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to repay, redeem, defease, extend, refinance, renew, replace or refund, Indebtedness referred to in clauses (2) through (5) above, and this clause (10) or that was otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 4.9; and
 
(11)
        
the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (11), not to exceed $50.0 million.
For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.9, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted debt described in clauses (1) through (11) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 4.9, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 4.9. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 4.9; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company as accrued. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.9, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
 
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
 
(1)
          
the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;
 
(2)
          
the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
 
(3)
          
in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
 
(i)
           
the fair market value of such assets at the date of determination; and
 
(ii)
          
the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
 
  (c)
        
Liens
.
 
4.10.  .  Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (a) in the case of any Lien securing any Indebtedness that is subordinate to the Notes, the Notes are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Lien and (b) in the case of any other Lien, the Notes are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

  (d)

4.11.  .  The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries
(1)
          
(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (A) on its Capital Stock or (B) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(2)
          
make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or
 
(3)

Existing Indebtedness;
 
(2)
          
the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancing thereof, provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of the Indenture;
 
(3)
          
the Indenture and the Notes;
 
(4)

any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired, provided that the EBITDA of such Person is not taken into account in determining whether such acquisition was permitted by the terms of the Indenture;
 
(6)
          
customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices;
 
(7)

(8)
          
permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;
 
(9)
          
any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary provided that (i) at the time such agreement or instrument is entered
into, such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries have a Leverage Ratio of less than 6.5 to 1.0 and (ii) neither such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) unless at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto, the Leverage Ratio for such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be less than 6.5 to 1.0.  For purposes of determining the Leverage Ratio under this clause (9) only, all references to the "Company" and its "Restricted Subsidiaries" or similar references in the definition of "Leverage Ratio" and other defined terms necessary to determine the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to refer to such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries, respectively; or
 
(10)
        
agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of Section 4.9 and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; that the restrictions therein are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Indenture, the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Transactions with Affiliates
 
(1)
          
such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a non-Affiliated Person; and

the Company delivers to the Trustee:

Additional Subsidiary Guarantees

4.14.

Additional Subsidiary Guarantees

No Restricted Subsidiary (including any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall consolidate (or for the avoidance of doubt, amalgamate) with or merge with or into (whether or not such Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company) whether or not affiliated with such Restricted Subsidiary unless:
 
(1)
          
subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation (or amalgamation) or merger (if other than such Restricted Subsidiary) assumes all the obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee (except in the case of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries
.
 
4.15.  .  The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including any Restricted Subsidiary or any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary so long as:
Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries
 
(1)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary;
 
(2)
          
no default with respect to any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary would permit (upon notice, lapse of time or otherwise) any holder of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to declare a default on such other Indebtedness or cause the payment thereof to be accelerated or payable prior to its stated maturity;
 
(3)
          
any Investment in such Subsidiary deemed to be made as a result of designating such Subsidiary an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not violate the provisions of Section 4.8 of the Indenture;
 
(4)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has a contract, agreement, arrangement, understanding or obligation of any kind, whether written or oral, with such Subsidiary other than (i) those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company or (ii) administrative, tax sharing and other ordinary course contracts, agreements, arrangements and understandings or obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business; and
 
(5)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for additional shares of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, or to maintain or preserve such Subsidiary's financial condition or to cause such
Subsidiary to achieve certain levels of operating results other than as permitted under Section 4.8 of the Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not designate as an Unrestricted Subsidiary any Subsidiary which, on the 1999 Indenture Date, was a Significant Subsidiary, and may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets of any such Significant Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case other than Iron Mountain Global, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (including without limitation Iron Mountain Europe Limited and its Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 4.15 shall not limit or restrict the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets to any other Subsidiary, including any Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent such sale, transfer or other disposition is permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described under Section 4.12 or Section 4.17.
 
The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if:
 
(1)
          
such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.9 of the Indenture; and
 
(2)
          
no Default or Event of Default would occur as a result of such designation.
 
  (i)
         
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions
.
 
4.16.  .  The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction unless:
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions
 
(1)
          
the consideration received in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is at least equal to the fair market value of the property sold, as determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and
 
(2)
          
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could incur the Attributable Indebtedness in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction in compliance with Section 4.9 of the Indenture.
 
  (j)
         
Asset Sales
.
 
4.17.  .  The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to:
Asset Sales
 
(1)
          
sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction, but excluding a Qualifying Sale and Leaseback Transaction) other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business (provided that the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.18 of the Indenture and/or the provisions of Section 5.1 of the Indenture and not by the provisions of this Section 4.17); or
 
(2)
          
issue or sell Equity Interests of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that in the case of either clause (1) or (2) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions:
 
(i)
           
have a fair market value in excess of $2.0 million; or
 
(ii)
          
result in Net Proceeds in excess of $2.0 million (each of the foregoing, an "Asset Sale") unless (x) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and for Asset Sales having a fair market value or resulting in Net Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million, evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents, like-kind assets or other assets used in or useful in the Company's business (in each case as determined in good faith by the Company, evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors and certified by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee);
 
provided
, , that the amount of:
however
 
(A)
         
any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets; and
 
(B)
          
any notes or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are immediately converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) or Cash Equivalents,
 
shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and provided, further, that the 75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (ii) (y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.  For the avoidance of doubt, a disposition that constitutes a Restricted Payment will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.8 and not by this Section 4.17.
 
A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by the Company to a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary or by a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to another Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an Asset Sale.
 
Within 360 days of any Asset Sale, the Company may, at its option, apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either:
 
(1)
          
to permanently reduce Senior Debt; or
 
(2)
          
to an investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or in another business or capital expenditure or other long-term/tangible assets, in each case, in the same line of business as the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries was engaged in on
the date of the Eighth Supplemental Indenture or in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto.
 
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Bank Debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.  Any Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds."  When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes, all holders of the 7

If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.17, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
 
An Asset Sale Offer shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.9 hereof.  No later than the date which is five Business Days after the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Asset Sale Offer and provide the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate setting forth the calculations used in determining the amount of Net Proceeds to be applied to the purchase of Notes.  The Company shall commence or cause to be commenced the Asset Sale Offer on a date no later than 15 Business Days after such notice (the "Commencement Date").

Within 30 calendar days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, stating:
(1)
          
that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.18 and that all Notes tendered shall be accepted for payment;

(3)
          
that any Note not tendered shall continue to accrue interest;
 
(4)
          
that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date;
 
(5)

(6)
          
that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Notes purchased; and

that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the repurchase of the Notes in connection with a Change of Control.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 4.18, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture or the Eighth Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
 
(b)
          
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:

accept for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.18 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
