Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company") discovered a computational error relating to foreign exchange rates in the calculation of its enterprise and International Physical Business segment revenue internal growth rates for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.  Correction of this error resulted in a decrease in the enterprise revenue internal growth rates for the quarter of 0.2% to 0.3%.  The Company's total revenue internal growth rate of 4% for the quarter, reported as a rounded whole number, did not change as a result of this correction.  The Company's storage revenue internal growth rate for the quarter, however, reported as a rounded whole number, was 3% rather than the 4% previously reported and the Company's service revenue internal growth rate for the quarter, reported as a rounded whole number, was 4% rather than the 5% previously reported.  On a business segment basis, the Company's International Physical Business segment total revenue internal growth rate for the quarter, reported as a rounded whole number, was 5% versus the 6% previously reported.  The revenue internal growth rates corrected as described above appear in the Company's Management Discussion and Analysis contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 and the related press release announcing the results for the first quarter of 2010 and do not impact the financial statements contained therein.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
