Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On September 15, 2010, Iron Mountain Incorporated's (the "Company") Board of Directors (the "Board") expanded the size of the Board by one member, from eleven to twelve, and elected Paul F. Deninger as a member of the Board.
 
Mr. Deninger joined Broadview International LLC ("Broadview"), a private technology-banking firm, in 1987 and became its chief executive officer in 1996.  Mr. Deninger was the chairman and chief executive officer of Broadview when it was acquired in 2003 by Jefferies & Company, Inc. ("Jefferies"), a global securities and investment banking firm and the principal operating subsidiary of Jefferies Group, Inc., (NYSE: JEF).  After the acquisition, Mr. Deninger joined Jefferies, where he currently serves as a vice chairman.
 
For his service as a director, Mr. Deninger will be entitled to the compensation the Company generally provides to its non-employee directors. A summary of the Company's currently-effective director compensation is filed as Exhibit 10.4 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.   Mr. Deninger will also be able to participate in the Company's Director Deferred Compensation Plan.  Upon his election, Mr. Deninger received an option to purchase 10,856 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $20.58 per share (equal to the fair market value of the common stock on September 15, 2010, as calculated in accordance with the option plan). This option will vest on the one year anniversary of the grant (or, if earlier, the annual meeting of Iron Mountain Incorporated that is closest to the one year anniversary).
 
Mr. Deninger has no family relationships with any director or executive officer of the Company, and there are no transactions in which Mr. Deninger has an interest requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
