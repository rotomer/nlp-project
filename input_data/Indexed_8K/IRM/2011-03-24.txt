Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 23, 2011, the board of directors (the "") of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the ""), authorized the issuance of one right (a "") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "").  The issuance is effective as of April 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on that date (the "").  Each Right, once exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Corporation one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of preferred stock of the Corporation, designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""), at a price of $120.00 per one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share (the ""), subject to certain adjustments.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the ""), dated as of March 23, 2011, by and between the Corporation and Mellon Investor Services LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company, as Rights Agent (the "").

As discussed below, initially the Rights will not be exercisable, certificates will not be sent to stockholders and the Rights will automatically trade with the Common Stock.
 
The Rights, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Board of Directors, become exercisable upon the close of business on the day (the "") which is the earlier of (a) the tenth (10th) business day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons, with certain exceptions set forth below, has acquired beneficial ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding voting shares of the Corporation (an "") and (b) the tenth (10th) business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any person (other than an Exempt Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement) of a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in such person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an Acquiring Person.
Distribution Date
Acquiring Person
 
An Acquiring Person does not include (a) the Corporation, (b) any subsidiary of the Corporation, (c) any employee benefit plan or employee stock plan of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the Corporation, or any trust or other entity organized, appointed, established or holding voting shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, (d) any person who the Board of Directors determines in good faith becomes the owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding inadvertently and without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Corporation (unless and until such person fails to divest itself, as soon as practicable, of beneficial ownership of a sufficient number of shares of voting stock of the Corporation so that such person would no longer otherwise qualify as an Acquiring Person), (e) 
any person who, immediately prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, is the beneficial owner of
fifteen percent (15%)
or more of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding
; provided, however, that if any such person thereafter becomes the beneficial owner of
additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the then-outstanding voting stock
of the Corporation (subject to certain exceptions), then such person will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person unless upon becoming the beneficial owner of such additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation such person does not beneficially own fifteen percent (15%) or more of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding
,
or (f) any person who becomes the owner of fifteen percent (15%) of the voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding as the result of an acquisition of shares of
voting stock of the Corporation by the Corporation which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares of voting stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such person so that such person would otherwise become an Acquiring Person; provided, however, that if any such person thereafter becomes the beneficial owner of
additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the then-outstanding voting stock
of the Corporation (subject to certain exceptions), then such person will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person unless upon becoming the beneficial owner of such additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation such person does not beneficially own fifteen percent (15%) or more of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation then outstanding.
 
Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be exercisable, will not be represented by a separate certificate, and will not be transferable apart from the Common Stock, but will instead be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate with a copy of the Summary of Rights to Purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock attached thereto (or in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, by book-entry account that evidences record ownership for such shares).  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date will contain a legend incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference, or, in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, such legend shall be included in a notice to the record holder of such shares.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any of the Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date (or the effectuation of a book-entry transfer of shares of Common Stock), with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate.  As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate certificates alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date.
Right Certificates
 
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.  The Rights will expire upon the close of business on the earliest to occur of: (i) March 22, 2013, (ii) the date on which the rights are redeemed or exchanged by the Corporation in accordance with the Rights Agreement and (iii) the date of the Corporation's 2012 annual meeting of stockholders if requisite stockholder approval of the Rights Agreement is not obtained at such meeting.
 
Shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will be non-redeemable and, unless otherwise provided in connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred shares, will be subordinate to any other series of the Corporation's preferred shares.  The Preferred Stock may not be issued except upon exercise of Rights
or in connection with a redemption or exchange of Rights.  Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, a quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1.00 per share or one thousand (1,000) times the cash dividends declared on the Common Stock.  In addition, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive one thousand (1,000) times any non cash dividends (other than dividends payable in equity securities) declared on the Common Stock, in like kind.  In the event of the liquidation of the Corporation, the holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock, a payment in an amount equal to the greater of $1,000 or one thousand (1,000) times the payment
made per share of Common Stock.  Each share of Preferred Stock will have one thousand (1,000) votes, voting together with the Common Stock.  In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Stock is exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive one thousand (1,000) times the amount received per share of Common Stock.  The rights of Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting are protected by anti-dilution provisions.
 
The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to certain adjustments from time to time in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision or combination of, the Common Stock.  The Exercise Price also is subject to adjustment in the event of extraordinary distributions of cash or other property to holders of Common Stock.
 
Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged, in the event that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Rights Agreement provides that proper provisions will be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise of each outstanding Right and payment of the Exercise Price, that number of shares of Preferred Stock having a fair market value determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement at the time of the transaction equal to approximately two (2) times the Exercise Price (such value to be determined with reference to the fair market value of the Common Stock as provided in the Rights Agreement).
 
In addition, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged, in the event that, after the time that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Corporation were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination (in which any shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for other securities or assets) or more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets or earning power of the Corporation and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) were to be sold or transferred in one or a series of related transactions, the Rights Agreement provides that proper provision will be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will thereupon become null and void) will from and after such date have the right to receive, upon payment of the Exercise Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a fair market value at the time of such transaction determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement equal to approximately two (2) times the Exercise Price.
 
At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting shares, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become null and void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Rights Agreement.
 
Fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share) may, at the election of the Corporation, be evidenced by depositary receipts.  The Corporation may also issue cash in lieu of fractional shares which are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share.
 
At any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right,
subject to adjustment (the "").  The determination of the Board of Directors to redeem the Rights may be made on such basis and be subject to such conditions as the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may establish.  Immediately upon the effective time of the redemption of the Rights, and without any further action and notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.  At the option of the Board of Directors, the Redemption Price may be paid in cash to each Rights holder or by the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock having a fair market value, determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement, equal to such cash payment.
Redemption Price
 
For as long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Corporation (at the direction of the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion) may amend the Rights Agreement in any manner without the approval of any holders of the Rights.  At any time when the Rights are not then redeemable, the Corporation (at the direction of the Board of Directors) may amend the Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights, provided that no such supplement or amendment may (a) adversely affect the interests of the holders of Right (other than an Acquiring Person or any other person in whose hands Rights are null and void under the provisions of Section 7(e) of the Rights Agreement), (b) cause the Rights Agreement again to become amendable other than in accordance with this sentence or (c) cause the Rights again to become amendable.  No supplement or amendment shall be made which changes the Redemption Price.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
The Rights will have certain anti-takeover effects.  The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire the Corporation without the approval of the Board of Directors.  As a result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire the Corporation even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of the Corporation's stockholders.  Because the Board of Directors can redeem the Rights, however, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors.

The amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock may be entitled upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the foregoing sentence is hereinafter referred to as the "" and the multiple of the amount to be distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation applicable pursuant to said clause to the determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount, as said multiple may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "."

Summary of Rights
 
(b)
          
Until the Close of Business on the day which is the earlier of (i) the tenth (10th) Business Day after the Stock Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth (10th) Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than an Exempt Person) of a tender or exchange offer upon the successful consummation of which such Person, or any Affiliate or Associate of such Person, would be an Acquiring Person (including any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights, the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the ""), (A) the Rights shall be evidenced by the certificates for Common Stock (or in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, by the book-entry account that evidences record ownership for such shares) registered in the names of the holders of Common Stock (together with, in the case of certificates for Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, the Summary of Rights) and not by separate Right certificates, and the record holders of such certificates (or such book-entry accounts) for Common Stock shall be the record holders of the Rights represented thereby and (B) each Right shall only be transferable simultaneously and together with the transfer of a share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided).  Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date or Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Stock (or the effectuation of a book-entry transfer of shares of Common Stock) shall constitute the surrender for transfer of the Right or Rights associated with the Common Stock evidenced thereby, whether or not accompanied by a copy of the Summary of Rights.
Distribution Date
 
(c)
          
Rights shall be issued in respect of all shares of Common Stock that become outstanding after the Record Date, but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Expiration Date or the Final Expiration Date.  Certificates that become outstanding (including, without limitation, certificates issued upon original issuance, disposition from the Corporation's treasury or transfer or exchange of Common Stock) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Expiration Date, or the Final Expiration Date, shall have impressed, printed, written or stamped thereon or otherwise affixed thereto substantially the following legend:
 
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to the same number of Rights (subject to adjustment) equal to the number of shares of common stock represented by this certificate, such Rights being on the terms set forth in the Rights Agreement by and between Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Corporation") and
Mellon Investor Services LLC (operating with the service name "BNY Mellon Shareowner Services") (the "Rights Agent"), dated as of March 23, 2011, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of the Corporation.  Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Agreement, such Rights may be redeemed, may become exercisable for securities or assets of the Corporation, or securities of another entity, may be exchanged for shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets of the Corporation or may expire. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Agreement, such Rights shall be evidenced by separate certificates and shall no longer be evidenced by this certificate.  The Corporation shall mail to the registered holder of this certificate a copy of the Agreement without charge within five (5) days after receipt of a written request therefor.  .
As provided in Section 7(e) of the Agreement, Rights issued to or Beneficially Owned by Acquiring Persons or their Affiliates or Associates (as such terms are defined in the Agreement) or any subsequent holder of such Rights shall be null and void and may not be exercised by or transferred to any Person
 
With respect to any book-entry shares of Common Stock, such legend shall be included in a notice to the record holder of such shares in accordance with applicable law.  With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, or any notice of the foregoing legend delivered to holders of book-entry shares, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates or registered in book-entry form shall be evidenced by such certificates alone or such registration in book-entry form, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate or book-entry shares, except as otherwise provided herein, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock.  In the event that the Corporation purchases or otherwise acquires any shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such shares of Common Stock shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Corporation shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock that are no longer outstanding.  Notwithstanding this paragraph (c), neither the omission of a legend, nor the failure to provide notice thereof, shall affect the enforceability of any part of this Agreement or the rights of any holder of the Rights.
 
(d)
          
As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Corporation will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Corporation will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested by the Corporation and provided with a shareholder list and all necessary or relevant information and documents,
at the Corporation's expense, send), by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of the Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, as shown by the records of the Corporation or the transfer agent or registrar for Common Stock, at the address of such holder shown on such records, a certificate substantially in the form provided by Section 4 hereof (a ""), evidencing one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) for each share of Common Stock so held.  As of and after the Distribution Date, the Rights shall be evidenced solely by Right Certificates and may be transferred by the transfer of the Right Certificate as permitted hereby, separately and apart from any transfer of one or more shares of Common Stock.

Subject to the provisions of Section 22 hereof, Right Certificates evidencing Rights whenever issued, (a) shall be dated as of the date of issuance of the Rights they represent and (b) subject to adjustment from time to time as provided herein, on their face shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share (including fractional shares which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share) of Preferred Stock as shall be set forth thereon at the price per one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock payable upon exercise of a Right provided by Section 7(b) hereof, as the same may from time to time be adjusted as provided herein (the "").

Each Right Certificate shall be countersigned by the Rights Agent either manually or by facsimile signature and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned.  In case any officer of the Corporation who shall have signed any Right Certificate shall cease to be such officer of the Corporation before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery of the Right Certificate by the Corporation, such Right Certificate, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Corporation.  Any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Corporation by any person who, on the date of the execution of such Right Certificate,
shall be a proper officer of the Corporation to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such person was not such an officer.

Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose with the form of certificate and assignment on the reverse side thereof duly endorsed (or enclose with such Right Certificate a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Rights Agent), duly executed by the registered holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and with such signature duly guaranteed and such other and further documentation as the Rights Agent or the Corporation may require.  The Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent.  Neither the Rights Agent nor the Corporation shall be obligated to take any action whatsoever with respect to the transfer of any such surrendered Right Certificate until the registered holder shall have (i) properly completed and duly executed the certificate contained in the form of assignment set forth on the reverse side of such Right Certificate, (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) from whom the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate are to be transferred (or the Beneficial Owner to whom such Rights are to be transferred) or Affiliates thereof as the Corporation or the Rights Agent shall reasonably request, and (iii) paid a sum sufficient to cover any Transfer Tax that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up combination or exchange of Rights Certificates.  Thereupon, subject to Sections 5, 7(f) and 14 hereof, the Corporation shall execute and the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested, registered in such name or names as may be designated by the surrendering registered holder.  The Rights Agent shall forward any such sum collected
by it to the Corporation or to such Persons as the Corporation shall specify by written notice.  The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation under any Section of this Agreement that requires the payment of Transfer Taxes unless and until it is satisfied that all such Transfer Taxes have been paid in full.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 7(e), 7(f) and 14 hereof, at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Close of Business on earlier of the Expiration Date and the Final Expiration Date, upon receipt by the Corporation and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security satisfactory to them and, if requested by the Corporation or Rights Agent, reimbursement to the Corporation and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, or upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, accompanied by a signature guarantee and such other and further documentation as the Rights Agent may require, the Corporation shall cause a new Right Certificate of like tenor to be issued and delivered to the registered owner in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued and delivered by the Corporation to the Rights Agent and countersigned and delivered by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or his duly authorized assign, subject to the provisions of Section 14(b) hereof.
 
(e)
          
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time (the "") when any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are Beneficially Owned by (i) such Acquiring Person (or any Associate or Affiliate of such Acquiring Person), (ii) a transferee of such Acquiring Person (or any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee after the invalidation time or (iii) a transferee of such Acquiring Person (or any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the invalidation time pursuant to either (A) a transfer from the Acquiring Person (or any such Associate or Affiliate) to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of Directors has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this Section 7(e), and subsequent transferees of such Persons referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, shall be null and void without any further action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Agreement.  No Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 hereof that represents Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate thereof whose Rights would be null and void pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(e), no Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person (or an Affiliate or Associate of such Acquiring Person) whose Rights would be null and void pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(e) or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person (or an Associate or Affiliate of such Acquiring Person) whose Rights would be null and void pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(e) shall be cancelled.  The Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) are complied with, but neither it nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of Right Certificates or any other Person as a result of any failure to make any determination with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.

(a)
          
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock or out of authorized and issued shares of Preferred Stock held in its treasury, such number of shares of Preferred Stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.
 
(b)
          
The Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares of Preferred Stock issued or reserved for issuance in accordance with this Agreement to be listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon the principal national securities exchange, if any, upon which the Common Stock is listed or, if the principal market for the Common Stock is not on any national securities exchange, to be eligible for or admitted to trading on any quotation or other system then in use.
 
(c)
          
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares (subject to payment of the full Exercise Price in respect thereof), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
 
(d)
          
The Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of the event described in Section 11(a)(ii),
 
or as soon as is required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act on an appropriate form, with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for Preferred Stock and (B) the earlier of the Expiration Date and the Final Expiration Date.  The Corporation may temporarily suspend (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent; and until such written notice is received by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may assume conclusively that no such suspension has occurred), for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock upon exercise of a Right in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective.  The Corporation shall also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been declared effective.
 
(e)
          
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all United States federal and state Transfer Taxes which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Preferred Stock issued or delivered upon the exercise of Rights.  The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any Transfer Tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of a Right Certificate to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates for Preferred Stock upon exercise of Rights in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate, and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver a Right Certificate or certificate for Preferred Stock to a Person other than such registered holder until any such Transfer Tax shall have been paid (any such Transfer Tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Corporation's or the Rights Agent's satisfaction that no such Transfer Tax is due.
 
(f)
           
The requirements of this Section 9 shall apply to shares of Common Stock of the Corporation if the Corporation has elected in accordance with Section 11(a)(iii) hereof to substitute shares of Common Stock for shares of Preferred Stock that otherwise may be purchased upon the exercise of Rights.

Preferred Stock Record Date
.  Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares of Preferred Stock is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Preferred Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated as of, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the full Exercise Price (and any applicable Transfer Taxes) was duly made; , ,
provided
however
that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the relevant Preferred Stock transfer books are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated as of, the next succeeding Business Day on which such Preferred Stock transfer books are open.
 
Section 11.
            
Adjustment of Exercise Price or Number of Shares
.
 
(a)
          
The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Preferred Stock which may be purchased upon exercise of a Right are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
 
(i)  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (B) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (C) combine or consolidate the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or effect a reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right after the record date for such event (if one shall have been established or, if not, after the date of such event) shall be the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock issuable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the Exercise Price to be in effect after the record date for such event (if one shall have been established or, if not, after the date of such event) shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such event by such fraction.  If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both this Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
 
(ii)
          
Subject to Section 27 hereof, in the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person, then, subject to the last sentence of Section 23(a) hereof and except as otherwise provided in this Section 11, each holder of a Right, except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof, shall thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such Right in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and payment of the Exercise Price, such number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock as shall equal the result obtained by (A) multiplying the then current Exercise Price by the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right would, absent adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii), be then exercisable and dividing the product by (B) fifty percent (50%) of the proportionate Fair Market Value of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(b) hereof) on the Stock Acquisition Date in respect of such event; , , if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is also subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii).
provided
however
(iii)
         
In the event that the Corporation does not have available sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize and reserve for issuance such number of additional shares of Preferred Stock as may from time to time be required to be issued upon the exercise in full of all Rights from time to time outstanding and, if necessary, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval thereof.  In lieu of issuing shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Corporation may, if the Board of Directors determines that such action is necessary or appropriate, elect to issue or pay, upon the exercise of the Rights, cash, property, shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, or any combination thereof, having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares of Preferred Stock which otherwise would have been issuable pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof as of the date the Board of Directors makes such election (which Fair Market Value shall be determined as provided by Section 11(b) hereof).  Subject to Section 23 hereof, any such election by the Board of Directors must be made and publicly announced within thirty (30) days after the date on which the event described in Section 11(a)(ii) occurs and shall be applicable with respect to all Rights exercised after such public announcement.  Notice of such election shall promptly be given to the Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent may conclusively assume that no such election has been made until it receives such notice.
 
(b)
          
For the purpose of this Agreement, the "" of any share of Preferred Stock, Common Stock or any other stock or any Right or other security or any other property on any date shall be determined as provided in this Section 11(b).  In the case of a publicly traded (as such term is hereinafter defined) stock or other security, the Fair Market Value thereof on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such stock or per unit of such other security for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to but not including such date; , , that in the event that the Fair Market Value of any share of Common Stock is to be determined as of a date that is within thirty (30) Trading Days after but not including (i) the ex-dividend date for a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock or (ii) the effective date of any subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or reclassification of the Common Stock, then, and in each such case, the Fair Market Value shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors to take into account such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or reclassification.  The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way (in either case, as reported in the applicable transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange), or, if the securities are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the applicable transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange (which, if approved by the Board of Directors,

may be a securities exchange of a country other than the United States of America) on which such security is listed or admitted to trading, or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any such national securities exchange, the last quoted price (or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices) in the over-the-counter market, as reported by NASDAQ or such other quotation reporting system then in use in the United States of America, or, if no bids for such security are so quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in such security selected by the Board of Directors.  The term "" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.  For purposes of this Section 11(b), a stock or other security shall be considered " " only (i) if registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or exempt from such registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(2)(B), (C) or (G) of the Exchange Act, (ii) if traded on a national securities exchange of a country other than the United States of America approved by the Board of Directors or (iii) if, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, there is sufficient active trading in such stock or other security that reported trading transactions therein fairly reflect the fair market value thereof.  If a security is not publicly traded, "Fair Market Value" shall mean the fair value per share of stock or per other unit of such other security, as determined by an independent investment banking firm experienced in the valuation of securities selected in good faith by the Board of Directors, or, if no such investment banking firm is, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, available to make such determination, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; , , that for purposes of making the adjustment provided for by Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Fair Market Value of a share of Preferred Stock, unless the Preferred Stock shall at the time be publicly traded (in which case its Fair Market Value shall be determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 11(b)), shall be 100% of the product of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock multiplied by the higher of the then Dividend Multiple or Vote Multiple applicable to the Preferred Stock (as defined in the certificate of designations of the Corporation relating to the Preferred Stock); , , , that the Board of Directors may, by resolution, determine that the Fair Market Value of a share of Preferred Stock shall be more than such amount but not more than 110% of the product of the then Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock multiplied by the higher of the then Dividend Multiple or Vote Multiple applicable to the Preferred Stock.  In the case of property other than securities, the Fair Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors based upon such appraisals or valuation reports of such independent experts as the Board of Directors shall in good faith determine to be appropriate in accordance with good business practices and fair to the interests of the holders of Rights.  Any determination made by the Board of Directors as provided for by this Section 11(b) shall be described in a written statement filed by the Corporation with the Rights Agent, shall be effective thereupon and only thereupon and shall be binding upon the Rights Agent and, as provided by and subject to Section 34 hereof, all holders of Rights.  The Rights Agent may be conclusively assumed to have no knowledge of any

(c)
          
In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Common Stock) less than the then current per share Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on such record date, the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current Fair Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible).  In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent may be conclusively assumed to have no knowledge of any such determination until it receives such statement and may conclusively rely on such statement.  Shares of Common Stock owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation.  Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(d)
          
In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, cash (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend not in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the previous regular quarterly cash dividend), other assets (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock) or options, rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of the Corporation or any Subsidiary (excluding those referred to in Section 11(c) hereof), the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent may be
conclusively assumed to have no knowledge of any such determination until it receives such statement and may conclusively rely on such statement) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness or options, rights or warrants so to be distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall be such current Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock.  Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and, in the event that such distribution is not so made notwithstanding the setting of a record date therefor, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(e)
          
Unless the Corporation shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(f), upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(c) or (d), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, that number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock obtained by (i) multiplying (A) the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock that could be purchased upon exercise of a Right immediately prior to the adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(e) by (B) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Exercise Price.
 
(f)
           
The Corporation may elect, on or after the date of any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(d), to adjust the number of Rights in substitution for any adjustment pursuant to Section 11(e) in the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right.  Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment.  Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights obtained by dividing the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Exercise Price by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Exercise Price.  The Corporation shall make a public announcement (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent; and until such written notice is received by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may assume conclusively that no such adjustment has occurred) of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made.  This record date may be the date on which the Exercise Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public announcement.  If the Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(f), the Corporation shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights, if any, to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Corporation, shall cause to be distributed to
such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Corporation, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment.  Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
 
(g)
          
All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share, as the case may be.
 
(h)
          
Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Exercise Price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the Rights as in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder but, nevertheless, shall represent the Rights as so adjusted.
 
(i)
           
Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the purchase price per whole share of Preferred Stock upon exercise of the Rights below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of such Preferred Stock at such adjusted purchase price per share.
 
(j)
           
Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of any reclassification of stock of the Corporation or any recapitalization, reorganization or partial liquidation of the Corporation or similar transaction, the Corporation shall be entitled to make such further adjustments in the number of shares of Preferred Stock which may be acquired upon exercise of the Rights, and such adjustments in the Exercise Price therefor, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by the other paragraphs of this Section 11, as the Board of Directors shall determine to be necessary or appropriate in order for the holders of the Rights in such event to be treated equitably and in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Agreement or in order that any such event shall not, but for such adjustment, in the opinion of counsel to the Corporation, result in the stockholders of the Corporation being subject to any United States federal income tax liability by reason thereof.  The Rights Agent may conclusively assume that no such determinations have been made until it receives a written statement from the Corporation to such effect and may conclusively rely on such statement.
 
(k)
          
If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than the Preferred Stock, thereafter the Exercise Price and the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of a Right
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained in Sections 11(a), 11(c), 11(d), 11(e), 11(f) and 11(j) hereof, as applicable, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof with respect to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
 
Section 12.
            
Certification of Adjusted Exercise Price or Number of Shares
.  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11, 13, 23(c) or 27 hereof, the Corporation shall (a) promptly prepare a certificate duly executed by an officer of the Corporation setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts giving rise to such adjustment, (b) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Corporation to make such certification or give such notice shall not affect the validity of or the force or effect of the requirement for such adjustment.  Any adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 11, 13, 23(c) or 27 hereof shall be effective as of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment.  The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment, or statement, therein contained, and shall have no duty or liability with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall equal the result obtained by (1) multiplying the then current Exercise Price by the number of one one-thousandths (1/1000) of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (2) fifty percent (50%) of the then per share Fair Market Value of the Common Stock of the Principal Party on the date of the consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; , , that the Exercise Price (as adjusted) and the number of shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11 hereof to reflect any events occurring in respect of the Common Stock of such Principal Party after the occurrence of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, (B) such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the term "Corporation" for all purposes of this Agreement shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party, (D) such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 hereof applicable to the reservation of Preferred Stock) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its shares of Common Stock thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; , , that, upon the subsequent occurrence of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, recapitalization, reclassification of shares, reorganization or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled to receive, upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Exercise Price, such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had it, at the time of such transaction, owned the shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party purchasable upon the exercise of a Right, and such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property and (E) the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall be of no effect following the occurrence of any event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above of this Section 13(a).

If the Corporation shall determine not to issue such fractional Rights, then, in lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the holders of record of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market Value of a whole Right.
 
(b)
          
The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share).  In lieu of issuing fractions of shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation may, at its election, issue depositary receipts evidencing fractions of shares pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Corporation and a depositary selected by it, provided that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all of the rights, privileges and preferences to which they would be entitled as owners of the Preferred Stock.  With respect to fractional shares that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share, if the Corporation does not issue such fractional shares or depositary receipts in lieu thereof, there shall be paid to the holders of record of Right Certificates at the time such Right Certificates are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market Value of a share of Preferred Stock.  As soon as practicable, the Corporation shall notify the Rights Agent of any election pursuant to this Section 14(b).  The Rights Agent may assume conclusively that no such election has occurred until it receives such notice.
 
(c)
          
The holder of a Right by the acceptance of a Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Right or any fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share) upon exercise of a Right.
 
(d)
          
Whenever a payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares is to be made by the Rights Agent, the Corporation shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient monies to the Rights Agent in the form of fully
collected funds to make such payments.  The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares under any Section of this Agreement relating to the payment of fractional Rights or fractional shares unless and until the Rights Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.

Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Corporation nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, judgment, decree or ruling (whether interlocatory or final) issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory, self regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided, however, that the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such injunction, order, judgment, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.
 
Section 16.
            
Agreement of Right Holders
.  Each holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Corporation and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:
 
(a)
          
prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights shall be evidenced by the certificates for Common Stock (or in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, by the book-entry account that evidences record ownership of such shares) registered in the name of the holders of Common Stock (together, as applicable, with the Summary of Rights), which certificates for Common Stock (or book-entry account) shall also constitute certificates for Rights, and not by separate Right Certificates, and each Right shall be transferable only simultaneously and together with the transfer of shares of Common Stock;
(b)

In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned, and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent, and, in all such cases, such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.

Section 20.
            
Duties of Rights Agent
.  The Rights Agent undertakes to perform only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties or obligations) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Corporation and the holders of Right Certificates by their acceptance thereof shall be bound:
 
(a)
          
The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection (who may be an employee of or outside legal counsel for the Corporation or the Rights Agent or otherwise), and the advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or to be taken omitted by it in accordance with such advice or opinion.
 
(b)
          
Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Corporation prior to taking, suffering any or omitting to take action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by a person reasonably believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and delivered to the Rights Agent.  Any such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
 
(c)
          
The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Corporation and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, punitive, indirect, consequential, or incidental loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage.  Any liability of the Rights Agent under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Corporation to the Rights Agent.
 
(d)
          
The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates
(except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Corporation only.
 
(e)
          
The Rights Agent shall (i) not have any liability for, or be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof), (ii) nor shall it have any liability for or be responsible for any breach by the Corporation of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate, (iii) nor shall it have any liability for or be responsible for any adjustment or change in the exercisability of Rights or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change, adjustment or procedure (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt by the Rights Agent of a certificate delivered pursuant to Section 12 hereof describing any such adjustment) and (iv) not by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Preferred Stock or other security to be delivered pursuant to the exercise of any Right or as to whether any shares of Preferred Stock or other security will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f)
           
The Corporation agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of the Agreement.
 
(g)
          
The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder and to accept and rely on any certificates delivered pursuant to any provision hereof from any person reasonably believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Corporation, and is authorized to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights Agent and it shall not be liable for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken to be taken by it in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions.  The Rights Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying upon the most recent instructions received by it from any such officer.  Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Corporation may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent under this Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective.  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than three (3) Business Days after the date any officer of the Corporation actually
receives such application unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions from the Corporation in response to such application specifying the action to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, or a written objection by the Corporation to such proposal.
 
(h)
          
The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Corporation or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Corporation may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Corporation or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the Rights Agent under this Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent, or any such shareholder, director, officer, Affiliate or employee from acting in any other capacity for the Corporation or for any other legal entity.
 
(i)
           
The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers and employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Corporation or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct (which gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) in the selection and continued employment thereof.
 
(j)
           
If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been properly completed to certify the holder is not an Acquiring Person (or an Affiliate or Associate thereof) or not duly executed, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Corporation.
 
Section 21.
            
Change of Rights Agent
.  The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing mailed to the Corporation and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock known to the Rights Agent and the Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail.  The Corporation may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Corporation shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Corporation shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall,
with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Corporation), then the Corporation shall become the Rights Agent or the holder of record of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Corporation or by such a court, shall be (a) a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof, which is authorized under such laws to exercise stock transfer powers or conduct a shareholder services business and is subject to supervision or examination in the conduct of its stock transfer business by federal or state authorities and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an Affiliate controlled by or under common control with one or more Persons described in clause (a) of this sentence.  After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed, but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Corporation shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in the event of resignation, removal or incapacity of the Rights Agent, the Corporation shall have the authority to act as the Rights Agent until a successor Rights Agent shall have assumed the duties of the Rights Agent hereunder.
 
Section 22.
            
Issuance of New Right Certificates
.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Corporation may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by the Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price per share and the number or kind or class of shares of stock or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Voting Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Corporation may, with respect to Voting Stock so issued or sold pursuant to (a) the exercise of stock options, (b) under any employee plan or arrangement, (c) upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Corporation or (d) a contractual obligation of the Corporation, in each case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale.
 
Section 23.
            
Redemption
.
 
(a)
          
The Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all, but not less than all, of the
then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 23(c) hereof (the "").  The redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time after the Board of Directors' action to redeem the Rights on such basis and subject to such conditions, as the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may establish. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable prior to the expiration of the Corporation's right of redemption.
Redemption Price
 
(b)
          
Without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate effective at the time so designated by action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price.  Within ten (10) days after the effective time of the action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Corporation shall give notice (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent; and until such written notice is received by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may assume conclusively that no such redemption has occurred) of such redemption to the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.  At the option of the Board of Directors, the Redemption Price may be paid in cash to each Rights holder or by the issuance of shares (and, at the Corporation's election pursuant to Section 14(b) hereof, cash or depositary receipts in lieu of fractions of shares other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share) of Preferred Stock or Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such cash payment.
provided
however
 
(c)
          
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the date of this Agreement, but before such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, (i) pay any dividend on Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combine or consolidate the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or effect a reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and as a consequence thereof the number of Rights outstanding shall change, then, and in each such event, the Redemption Price may, by action of the Board of Directors in its discretion, be appropriately adjusted in respect of such transaction so as to maintain the aggregate Redemption Price of all Rights after such transaction at the same amount, insofar as practicable, as before the transaction.
 
Section 24.
            
Notice of Proposed Actions.
 
(a)
          
In case the Corporation, after the Distribution Date, shall propose (i) to effect any of the transactions referred to in Section 11(a)(i) hereof or to pay any
 
dividend to the holders of record of its shares of Common Stock payable in shares of capital stock of any class or to make any other distribution to the holders of record of its Common Stock (other than a regular periodic cash dividend at a rate not in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the rate of the last cash dividend theretofore paid), (ii) to offer to the holders of record of its Common Stock options, warrants, or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Stock or Common Stock or any recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation, (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger with or into, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets or earning power of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person or Persons, or (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, then, in each such case, the Corporation shall give to each holder of record of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 25 hereof, notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such transaction referred to in Section 11(a)(i) or such dividend or distribution, or the date on which such reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the record date for determining participation therein by the holders of record of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of record of the Preferred Stock for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of record of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.  The failure to give notice required by this Section 24 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the action taken by the Corporation or the vote upon any such action.
 
(b)
          
In case the event referred to in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall occur, then the Corporation shall as soon as practicable thereafter, in accordance with Section 25 hereof, give to each holder of a Right notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe the event and the consequences of the event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.

appropriate officer of the Corporation which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of this Section 26, the Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment, subject to the last sentence hereof.  Any and all supplements and amendments to this Agreement shall be evidenced in writing signed by the Corporation and the Rights Agent.

Section 27.
            
Exchange
.
 
(a)
          
The Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) by exchanging for each such Right one share of Common Stock of the Corporation, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such number of shares of Common Stock per Right being hereinafter referred to as the "").  The Rights Agent shall be given written notice as soon as practicable of any such exchange and the Exchange Ratio pursuant to which such exchange is effected and shall be deemed to have no knowledge thereof until it receives such notice.  The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.  Prior to effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 27, the Board of Directors may direct the Corporation to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board of Directors shall then approve (the "").  If the Board of Directors so directs, the Corporation shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "") all of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all Persons entitled to receive shares pursuant to the exchange shall be entitled to receive such shares (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited in the Trust) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Voting Stock then outstanding.  From and after the occurrence of an event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exchanged pursuant to this Section 27(a) shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and may not be exchanged pursuant to this Section 27(a).

(b)
          
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to Section 27(a) and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio.  The Corporation shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange, and the Rights Agent shall be given prompt written notice of any such exchange (and until such written notice is received by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may assume conclusively that no such exchange has occurred); , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  The Corporation promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.  Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.

however
 
(c)
          
In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 27, the Corporation shall substitute to the extent of such insufficiency, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock or fractions thereof having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock as of the date any Person becomes an Acquiring Person.
 
(d)
          
The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares.  In lieu of such fractional shares, the Corporation shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock.  For the purposes of this Section 27(d), the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock shall be the closing price of a share of Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 27.

The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the ""), dated as of March 23, 2011, by and between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC (operating with the service name "BNY Shareowner Services"), a New Jersey limited liability company, as Rights Agent (the "").  For those interested in the specific terms of the Rights Agreement, we provide the following summary description. 
Rights Agreement
Rights Agent
Please note, however, that this description is only a summary, and is not complete, and should be read together with the entire Rights Agreement, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated March 24, 2011.  A copy of the agreement is available free of charge from the Company.
 
As discussed below, initially the Rights will not be exercisable, certificates representing the Rights will not be sent to our stockholders and the Rights will automatically trade with our Common Stock.
 
Holder of a Right Is Not Deemed a Stockholder
.  Until a Right becomes exercisable and is exercised or exchanged pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, the holder of a Right, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Exercisability
.  Prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in this paragraph), the Rights will not be exercisable and will not be transferable apart from our Common Stock.  Unless earlier redeemed by our Board of Directors, the Rights will become exercisable upon the close of business on the day (the "") which is the earlier of:
Distribution Date
 
                 
the tenth day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons, with certain exceptions as described below, has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding voting shares (an ""); and
Acquiring Person
 
                 
the tenth business day after the date of the commencement by any person (other than an Exempt Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement) of a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in such person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an Acquiring Person prior, subject to the ability of our Board of Directors to establish a later date.
 
Acquiring Person
.  An Acquiring Person does not include:
 
                 
the Company or any of our subsidiaries;
 
                 
any employee benefit plan or employee stock plan of the Company or of any or our subsidiaries or any trust or other entity organized, appointed, established or holding voting shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan;
 
                 
any person or group of affiliated or associated persons who, immediately prior to the date of the Rights Agreement, is the beneficial owner of 15% or more of our shares of voting stock then outstanding (provided that any such person or group shall become an Acquiring Person upon acquisition of an additional 0.25% or more of our voting shares, unless such acquisition of additional voting shares is pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on our outstanding voting stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of our outstanding voting stock); or
 
                 
any person or group of affiliated or associated persons whose ownership of 15% or more of our shares of voting stock then outstanding results solely from (i) any action or transaction or transactions approved by our Board of Directors before such person or group became an Acquiring Person or (ii) a reduction in the number of our issued and outstanding voting shares pursuant to a transaction or transactions approved by our Board of Directors (provided that any such person or group shall become an Acquiring Person upon acquisition of an additional 0.25% or more of our voting shares, unless such acquisition of additional voting shares is pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on our outstanding voting stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of our outstanding voting stock).
 
In addition, if our Board of Directors determines in good faith that a person became an Acquiring Person inadvertently and without any intention of changing or influencing
control over our Company, then such person will not be deemed to become an Acquiring Person unless and until such person have failed to divest itself, as soon as practicable, of sufficient number of voting shares so that such person would no longer otherwise qualify as an Acquiring Person.
 
Evidence of Ownership of Rights
.  The Rights will be evidenced by certificates for Common Stock together with this summary of rights or, in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, by the book-entry account that evidences record ownership for such shares, each as registered in the names of holders of our Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, and not by separate Right certificates.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date will contain a legend incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference.  With respect to any book-entry shares of Common Stock, such legend shall be included in a notice to the record holder of such shares.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any such certificate or book-entry shares, except as otherwise provided in the Rights Agreement, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock.  As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("") will be mailed to holders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate certificates alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date.
Right Certificates
 
Expiration
.  The Rights will expire upon the close of business on the earliest to occur of: (i) March 22, 2013, (ii) the date on which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged by the Company in accordance with the Rights Agreement and (iii) the date of the Company's 2012 annual meeting of stockholders if requisite stockholder approval of the Rights Agreement is not obtained at such meeting.
 
Preferred Stock Material Provisions
.  Each one one-thousandth (1/1,000) share of our Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights:
 
                 
will be non-redeemable;
 
                 
unless otherwise provided in connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred shares, will be subordinate to any other series of our  preferred shares;
 
                 
will be entitled to receive when, as and if declared, a quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $0.001 per share or the cash dividends declared on one share of our Common Stock, and an amount equal to any non-cash dividends (other than dividends payable in equity securities) declared on one share of our Common Stock, in like kind;
 
                 
will be entitled to receive upon liquidation of the Company, a payment in an amount equal to the greater of $1.00 or the payment made per share of our Common Stock;
 
                 
will have one vote, voting together with the Common Stock; and
                 
will be entitled to receive in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Stock is exchanged, the same amount received per share of our Common Stock.
 
The rights of our Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting are protected by anti-dilution provisions.
 
Exercise Price Adjustments
.  The Exercise Price of the Rights and the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to certain adjustments from time to time in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision or combination of, our Common Stock.  The Exercise Price for the Rights also is subject to adjustment in the event of extraordinary distributions of cash or other property to holders of Common Stock.
 
Flip In
.  Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Rights Agreement provides that proper provisions will be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will thereupon become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon payment of the Exercise Price, that number of shares of the Preferred Stock having a fair market value determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement at the time of the transaction equal to approximately two times the Exercise Price (such value to be determined with reference to the fair market value of our Common Stock as provided in the Rights Agreement).
 
Flip Over
.  Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged, in the event that, after the time that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, we were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination (in which any shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for other securities or assets) or more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) were to be sold or transferred in one or a series of related transactions, the Rights Agreement provides that proper provision will be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will thereupon become null and void) will from and after such date have the right to receive, upon payment of the Exercise Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a fair market value at the time of such transaction determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement equal to approximately two times the Exercise Price.
 
Exchange
.  At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding voting shares, our Board of Directors may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become null and void), in whole or in part, for shares of our Common Stock in accordance with the Rights Agreement.
 
Fractional Shares
.  Fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share) may, at our election, be evidenced by depositary receipts.  We may also issue cash in lieu of fractional shares which are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share.
Redemption
.  At any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, we may (at the direction of our Board of Directors) redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right, subject to adjustment (the "").  The redemption of the Rights by our Board of Directors may be made effective at such time and subject to such conditions, as our Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion may establish.  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rights Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable prior to the expiration of our right of redemption.  Immediately upon the effective time of the action of our Board of Directors authorizing redemption of the Rights, and without any further action and notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.  At the option of our Board of Directors, the Redemption Price may be paid in cash to each Rights holder or by the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock having a fair market value, determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement, equal to such cash payment.
Redemption Price
 
Amendments
.  For as long as the Rights are then redeemable, we (at the direction of our Board of Directors) may amend the Rights in any manner without the approval of any holders of the Rights.  At any time when the Rights are not then redeemable, we (at the direction of our Board of Directors) may amend the Rights without the approval of any holders of Rights (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any provision contained in the Rights Agreement which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions in the Rights Agreement or (iii) to change or supplement the provisions in the Rights Agreement in any manner which we may deem necessary or desirable, provided that no such supplement or amendment pursuant to this clause (iii) shall adversely affect the interest of the holders of Right Certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or any other person in whose hands Rights are null and void under the provisions of Section 7(e) of the Rights Agreement).
