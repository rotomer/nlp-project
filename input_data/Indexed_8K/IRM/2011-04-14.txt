On April 12, 2011, the board of directors (the "Board") of Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company") and Robert T. Brennan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, mutually agreed that Mr. Brennan would step down as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On the same day, Mr. Brennan also resigned as a director of the Company.  The Company expects to enter into a separation agreement with Mr. Brennan and to pay to Mr. Brennan the severance set forth in Mr. Brennan's employment agreement with the Company, which has been previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed August 11, 2008, and described under "Termination and Change of Control Arrangements" in the Company's preliminary proxy statement filed on April 1, 2011.  The separation agreement between the Company and Mr. Brennan is expected to contain substantially the same rights and obligations as are provided for in Mr. Brennan's employment agreement.
 
On the same day, the Board also elected C. Richard Reese as Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective immediately.  For information called for by Item 5.02(c)(2) of Form 8-K, reference is made to the Company's preliminary proxy statement filed on April 1, 2011, the relevant sections of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
