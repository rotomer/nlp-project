On September 20, 2011, Iron Mountain Incorporated, or the Company, announced that it priced an underwritten public offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019, or the Notes. The Notes will be sold at 100.0% of par.  The net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes are expected to be $393.7 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the shareholder payout commitments we have made and possible future acquisitions and investments.

Fixed charges consist of interest expense, net and the interest portion of rent expense, but does not include interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.
