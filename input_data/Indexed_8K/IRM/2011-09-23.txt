For the purposes of this provision, the expression "an offer of notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any relevant member state means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that member state by any measure implementing the prospectus directive in that member state and the expression "prospectus directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the relevant member state), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each relevant member state and the expression "2010 PD Amending Directive" means Directive 2010/73/EU.

to the prohibition contained in article 3 of the Dutch Securities Transaction Supervision Act 1995 is applicable and the conditions attached to such exemption or exception are complied with.

This indemnity

provided, however,
 
agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the (A) Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in the case of each of (A) and (B), to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 7(d).  This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this Section 7).  In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable
 
time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties) or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleading parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or reasonably could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
 
(d)
          
The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that the statements with respect to the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the "Discounts" and "Price stabilization and short positions" paragraphs of the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company or any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
8.
            
Contribution
.  In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting, in the case of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses suffered by the Company and the Guarantors any contribution received by the Company and the Guarantors from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company and the Guarantors) as incurred to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
 
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package.  The relative fault of each of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each Underwriter and its respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise.  The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, as the case may be, shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.

Default by an Underwriter
.
 
(a)
          
If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the
 
"") and such Defaulted Notes do not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then each non-defaulting Underwriter shall purchase an aggregate amount of the Defaulted Notes equal to the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth opposite such Underwriter's name on Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased by all non-defaulting Underwriters.
Defaulted Notes
 
(b)
          
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Defaulted Notes equal or exceed in the aggregate 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right, within 48 hours after the previously scheduled Closing Date, to make arrangements for one or more of such non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon among such non-defaulting Underwriters and upon the terms herein set forth; that if the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements within such 48-hour period, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company and the Guarantors.
provided
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 9 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, any of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

The representations contained in Section 1 and the agreements contained in Sections 5, 7, 8 and 11(d) hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 9 or 11 hereof.

Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. An Officer of each Guarantor shall sign the Subsidiary Guarantee for the Guarantor by manual or facsimile signature.
 
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security or Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security or Subsidiary Guarantee shall nevertheless be valid.
 
A Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
 
The Trustee shall at any time, and from time to time, authenticate Securities for original issue in the principal amount provided in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order. Such Company Order may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to written or electronic signed instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agent or agents. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication unless otherwise provided by a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate.
 
The aggregate principal amount of Securities of any Series outstanding at any time may not exceed any limit upon the maximum principal amount for such Series set forth in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2, except as provided in Section 2.8.
 
Prior to the issuance of Securities of any Series, the Trustee shall have received and (subject to Section 7.2) shall be fully protected in relying on: (a) the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate establishing the form of the Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series and the terms of the Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series, (b) an Officers' Certificate complying with Sections 10.4 and 10.5, and (c) an Opinion of Counsel complying with Sections 10.4 and 10.5.

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate.
 
Section 2.4.
                                  
REGISTRAR AND PAYING AGENT.
 
The Company shall maintain, with respect to each Series of Securities, at the place or places specified with respect to such Series pursuant to Section 2.2, an office or agency where Securities of such Series may be presented or surrendered for payment ("Paying Agent"), where Securities of such Series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such Series and this Indenture may be served ("Service Agent").  The Registrar shall keep a register with respect to each Series of Securities and to their transfer and exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address, and any change in the name or address, of each Registrar, Paying Agent or Service Agent. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Registrar or Paying Agent or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the name and address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
 
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more co-registrars, additional paying agents or additional service agents and may from time to time rescind such designations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent and Service Agent in each place so specified pursuant to Section 2.2 for Securities of any Series for such
 
purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the name or address of any such co-registrar, additional paying agent or additional service agent. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar; the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent; and the term "Service Agent" includes any additional service agent. The Company or any Guarantor may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or Service Agent. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall be subject to any obligations imposed by the provisions of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent.
 
The Company hereby appoints the Trustee the initial Registrar and Paying Agent and for each Series unless another Registrar and Paying Agent, as the case may be, is appointed prior to the time Securities of that Series are first issued.
 
Section 2.5.
                                  
PAYING AGENT TO HOLD MONEY IN TRUST.
 
The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust, for the benefit of Securityholders of any Series of Securities, or the Trustee, all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Series of Securities, and will notify the Trustee of any default by the Company or the Guarantors in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of Securityholders of any Series of Securities, subject to Article XIII hereof, all money held by it as Paying Agent.
 
Section 2.6.
                                  
SECURITYHOLDER LISTS.
 
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders of each Series of Securities and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least ten days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list, in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of Securityholders of each Series of Securities.
 
Section 2.7.
                                  
TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.
 
Where Securities of a Series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same Series, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions are met. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the
 
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6 or 9.6).
 
Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange Securities of any Series for the period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days immediately preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that Series selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any Series selected, called or being called for redemption as a whole or the portion being redeemed of any such Securities selected, called or being called for redemption in part.
 
Section 2.8.
                                  
MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 2.9.
                                  
OUTSTANDING SECURITIES.
 
The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest on a Global Security effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof and those described in this Section as not outstanding.
 
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.8, it ceases to be outstanding until the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
 
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds on the Maturity of Securities of a Series money sufficient to pay such Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities of the Series cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
 
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company, a Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or a Guarantor holds the Security.
 
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.2.
 
Section 2.10.
                            
TREASURY SECURITIES.
 
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities of a Series have concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, Securities of a Series owned by the Company or an Affiliate shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Securities of a Series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Securities of a Series that are to be acquired by the Company, any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or any Guarantor pursuant to an exchange offer, tender offer or other agreement shall not be deemed to be owned by the Company, such Guarantor, a Subsidiary of the Company or such Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Company or such Guarantor until legal title to such Securities passes to the Company, such Guarantor, such Subsidiary or such Affiliate, as the case may be.
 
Section 2.11.
                            
TEMPORARY SECURITIES.
 
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a Company Order. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee upon request shall authenticate definitive Securities of the same Series and date of maturity in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, temporary securities shall have the same rights under this Indenture as the definitive Securities.
 
Section 2.12.
                            
CANCELLATION.
 
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee with written instructions for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall dispose of such canceled Securities in accordance with the Trustee's customary practice as instructed by the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
Section 2.13.
                            
DEFAULTED INTEREST.
 
If the Company and the Guarantors default in a payment of interest on a Series of Securities, the Company or any such Guarantor (to the extent of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee) shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Securityholders of the Series on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be at the earliest practicable date but in all events at least five Business Days prior to the payment date, in each case at the rate provided for with respect to the applicable Securities. The Trustee shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, and shall, promptly thereafter, notify the Trustee of any such date. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Company) shall mail to Securityholders of the Series a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid. The Company and the Guarantors may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
 
Section 2.14.
                            
RECORD DATE.

Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable or (iii) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented by such Global Security shall have happened and be continuing. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as the Depository shall direct in writing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security with like tenor and terms.

CUSIP NUMBERS.
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any
 
notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP number.
 
Section 3.1.

SELECTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED.
 
If less than all of any Series of Securities are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee shall select the Securities of the Series to be redeemed among the applicable Holders on a basis (or, in the case of any Series of Securities issued in global form as discussed in Section 2.15, based on a method that most nearly approximates a selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements, provided that no Securities of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.

any other information as may be required by the terms of the particular Series or the Securities of a Series being redeemed.
 
At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption to the Holders in the Company's name and at its expense; provided that the Company gives the Trustee written notice of such request at least 10 days prior to the date of the giving of such notice (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Trustee).

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

Section 6.2.
                                  
ACCELERATION OF MATURITY.
 
If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (g) and (h) of Section 6.1 of the Indenture relating to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of a Series by notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the unpaid principal of and any interest on all the Securities of that Series (or, if any Securities of that Series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such Securities) to be due and payable immediately; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any Obligation with respect to Senior Bank Debt is outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement upon a declaration of acceleration of the Securities of a Series, the principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities will not be payable until the earlier of:
 
(a)
                                 
the day which is five Business Days after written notice of acceleration is received by the Company and the Credit Agent, or
 
(b)
                                
the date of acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. If an Event of Default specified in clauses (g) and (h) of Section 6.1 of the Indenture with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary occurs, the principal of, and premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all outstanding Securities of that Series will become immediately due and payable without further action or notice.
 
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Securities of that Series because an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in clause (e) of Section 6.1 of the Indenture, the declaration of acceleration of the Securities of that Series shall be automatically annulled if the holders of any Indebtedness described in such clause have rescinded the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 30 days from the date of such declaration and if:
 
(a)
                                 
the annulment of the acceleration of the Securities of that Series would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a competent jurisdiction, and
 
(b)
                                
all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Securities of that Series that became due solely because of the acceleration of such Securities, have been cured or waived.
 
In the case of any Event of Default occurring by reason of any willful action (or inaction) taken (or not taken) by or on behalf of the Company with the intention of avoiding payment of any make whole price or premium, as applicable, that the Company would have had to pay if the Company then had elected to redeem the Securities of a Series pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture, if any, the applicable make whole price, or an
 
equivalent premium, as the case may be, shall become and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law upon the acceleration of the Securities of that Series.
 
Section 6.3.
                                  
COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE.
 
The Company covenants that if
 
(a)
                                 
default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(b)
                                
default is made in the payment of principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof, or
 
(c)
                                 
default is made in the deposit of any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of a Security,
 
THEN, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal or any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or deemed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any Series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such Series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
Section 6.4.
                                  
TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue
 
principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
 
(a)
                                 
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
(b)
                                
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same,
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
Section 6.5.
                                  
TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF SECURITIES.
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
Section 6.6.
                                  
APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED.
 
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
 
First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7;
 
Second: To the holders of Senior Debt of the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, to the extent required by Article XIII hereof;
 
Third: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
 
Fourth: To the Company.
 
Section 6.7.
                                  
LIMITATION ON SUITS.
 
No Holder of any Security of any Series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
 
(a)
                                 
such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that Series;
 
(b)
                                
the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
 
(c)
                                 
such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
(d)
                                
the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
(e)
                                 
no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.

UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.
 
Subject to Articles XII and XIII hereof, notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and premium and interest, if any, on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 6.9.
                                  
RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
Section 6.10.
                            
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.
 
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 2.8, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
Section 6.11.
                            
DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

(a)
                                 
such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
 
(b)
                                
the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
 
(c)
                                 
subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would reasonably be expected to expose the Trustee to personal liability.
Section 6.13.
                            
WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such Series waive any past Default hereunder with respect to such Series and its consequences, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security of such Series (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS.

DUTIES OF TRUSTEE.
 
(a)
                                 
If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs.
 
(b)
                                
Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
 
(i)
                                    
The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others; and
 
(ii)
                                 
In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon Officers' Certificates or Opinions of Counsel furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
however, in the case of any such Officers' Certificates or Opinions of Counsel which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine such Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
 
(c)
                                 
The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(i)
                                    
This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section;
 
(ii)
                                 
The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(iii)
                              
The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it with respect to Securities of any Series in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such Series relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such Series;
 
(d)
                                
Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this Section;
 
(e)
                                 
The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
 
(f)
                                   
The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law;
 
(g)
                                
No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk is not reasonably assured to it; and
 
(h)
                                
The Paying Agent, the Registrar and any authenticating agent shall be entitled to the protections, immunities and standard of care as are set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section with respect to the Trustee.

Section 7.3.
                                  
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE.
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

Section 7.5.
                                  
NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.
 
If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any Series and if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee as described in Section 7.2(h) hereof, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder of the Securities of that Series and, if any Bearer Securities are outstanding, publish on one occasion in an Authorized Newspaper, notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security of any Series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as its corporate trust committee or a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Securityholders of that Series.
 
Section 7.6.
                                  
REPORTS BY TRUSTEE TO HOLDERS.
 
Within 60 days after May 15 in each year, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear on the register kept by the Registrar and, if
any Bearer Securities are outstanding, publish in an Authorized Newspaper, a brief report dated as of such May 15, in accordance with, and to the extent required under, TIA Section 313.
 
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders of any Series shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities of that Series are listed. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when Securities of any Series are listed on any stock exchange or any delisting thereof.
 
Section 7.7.
                                  
COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY.
 
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall agree in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
 
The Company shall fully indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their agents (including the cost of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, or any Holder or any other Person)) against any and all loss, damages, claims, liability or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred by it except as set forth in the next paragraph in the performance of their duties under this Indenture as Trustee or Agent. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim of which a Responsible Officer has received notice for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This indemnification shall apply to officers, directors, employees, shareholders and agents of the Trustee and any Agent.
 
The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee or by any officer, director or employee of the Trustee caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
 
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities of any Series on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Securities of that Series.
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(g) or (h) (or any comparable provisions set forth in a supplemental indenture) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.
The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
 
Section 7.8.
                                  
REPLACEMENT OF TRUSTEE.
 
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.
 
The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more Series by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any Series may remove the Trustee with respect to that Series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of one or more Series if:
 
(a)
                                 
the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
 
(b)
                                
the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
 
(c)
                                 
a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
(d)
                                
the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
 
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
 
If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any one or more Series does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Securities of the applicable Series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
If the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any one or more Series fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder of the applicable Series, who has been a Securityholder for at least six months, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Promptly after that, the retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges hereunder, transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.7, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee with respect to each Series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to each
Securityholder of each such Series and, if any Bearer Securities are outstanding, publish such notice on one occasion in an Authorized Newspaper. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring trustee with respect to expenses and liabilities incurred by it prior to such replacement.
 
Section 7.9.
                                  
SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE BY MERGER, ETC.
 
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
 
Section 7.10.
                            
ELIGIBILITY; DISQUALIFICATION.
 
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b).
 
Section 7.11.
                            
PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.
 
The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated.
 
Section 8.1.
                                  
OPTION TO EFFECT LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.
 
The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have either Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof be applied to all outstanding Securities of a Series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article VIII.
 
Section 8.2.
                                  
LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE.
 
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.2, each of the Company and the Guarantors, if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Securities of such Series and related Subsidiary Guarantees on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Securities of such Series, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.5 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture as it relates to
such Securities (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities of such Series to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.4 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (b) the Company's and Guarantors' obligations with respect to such Securities under Article II hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article VIII. Subject to compliance with this Article VIII, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.3 hereof.
 
Section 8.3.
                                  
COVENANT DEFEASANCE.
 
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.3, each of the Company and the Guarantors, if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants specified pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof and Article V hereof with respect to the outstanding Securities of such Series and related Subsidiary Guarantees on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities of such Series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture, such Securities and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, if any, shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.3 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 hereof, Sections 6.1(c) through 6.1(f) and 6.1(i) hereof (or any comparable provisions set forth in a supplemental indenture) shall not constitute Events of Default.

(c)
                                 
in the case of an election under Section 8.3 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States (which counsel may be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Securities of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(e)
                                 
such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;
 
(f)
                                   
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally;

Holders of such Securities over any other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and
 
(h)
                                
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
 
Section 8.5.
                                  
DEPOSITED MONEY AND GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO BE HELD IN TRUST; OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
 
Subject to Section 8.6 hereof, all money and non-callable Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.5, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof in respect of the outstanding Securities of a Series subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
The Company and the Guarantors shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Securities of a Series subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance.
 
Anything in this Article VIII to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.4 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.4(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
Section 8.6.
                                  
REPAYMENT TO COMPANY.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Securities of a Series subject to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest, if any, have become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustee or
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
 
Section 8.7.
                                  
REINSTATEMENT.
 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture, the Securities of such Series and the related Subsidiary Guarantees, if any, shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the Company make any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any such Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
 
Section 9.1.
                                  
WITHOUT CONSENT OF HOLDERS.
 
Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities:
 
(a)
                                 
to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,
 
(b)
                                
to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities,
 
(c)
                                 
to provide for the assumption of the Company's or any Guarantor's obligations to Holders of a Security in the case of a merger or consolidation,
 
(d)
                                
to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of a Security (including providing for additional Subsidiary Guarantees) or that does not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Securityholder, or
 
(e)
                                 
to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA.
 
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 of the Indenture, the Trustee
shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Section 9.2.
                                  
WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS.
 
Except as provided in Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 of the Indenture, the Indenture or the Securities of a Series may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each Series then outstanding affected by the supplemental indenture implementing such amendment or supplement (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities), and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.12 of the Indenture, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such Series, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Securities of such Series may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of each Series affected by such supplemental indenture implementing such amendment or supplement (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities).
 
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After a supplemental indenture or waiver under this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Securities affected thereby and, and if any Bearer Securities affected thereby are outstanding, publish on one occasion in an Authorized Newspaper, a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture or waiver. Any failure by the Company to mail or publish such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
 
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Securities as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
 
Section 9.3.
                                  
LIMITATIONS.
 
Without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Securities held by a non-consenting Holder of Securities):
(a)
                                 
reduce the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
 
(b)
                                
reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Security or alter any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of any Security in a manner adverse to the Holders of such Security;
 
(c)
                                 
reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Security;
 
(d)
                                
waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security (except a rescission of acceleration of the Securities of any Series by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of such Series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
 
(e)
                                 
make any Security payable in money other than that stated in such Security;
 
(f)
                                   
make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Securities of any Series to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities;
 
(g)
                                
waive a redemption payment with respect to any Security (other than a payment required by any "Change of Control" or "Asset Sale" covenant set forth in a supplemental indenture relating to Securities of a Series);
 
(h)
                                
except pursuant to the Indenture, release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, or change any Subsidiary Guarantee in any manner that would materially adversely affect the Securityholders; or
 
(i)
                                    
make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
 
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this Section 9.3 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
Section 9.4.

Section 9.5.
                                  
REVOCATION AND EFFECT OF CONSENTS.
 
Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent
Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective.
 
Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Securityholder of each Series affected by such amendment or waiver unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (a) through (h) of Section 9.3. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
 
Section 9.6.
                                  
NOTATION ON OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES.
 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment or waiver on any Security of any Series thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for Securities of that Series may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate upon request new Securities of that Series that reflect the amendment or waiver.
 
Section 9.7.
                                  
TRUSTEE TO SIGN AMENDMENTS; TRUSTEE PROTECTED.
 
The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, complying with the requirements of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 hereof, and covering such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably require.
 
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall transmit a copy of such supplemental indenture or a notice provided by the Company to the Trustee setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby. In the case of certificated Securities, such notice shall be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register.  Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

Section 10.15.
                      
SECURITIES IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY OR IN EUROS.
 
Unless otherwise specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Indenture with respect to a particular Series of Securities, whenever for purposes of this Indenture any action may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all Series or all Series affected by a particular action at the time outstanding and, at such time, there are outstanding Securities of any Series which are denominated in a coin or currency other than Dollars (including Euros), then the principal amount of Securities of such Series which shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of taking such action shall be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount at the Market Exchange Rate at such time. For purposes of this Section 10.15, "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean the noon Dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of that currency as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in the case of Euros, Market Exchange Rate shall mean the rate of exchange determined by the Commission of the European Union (or any successor thereto) as published in the Official Journal of the European Union (such publication or any successor publication, the "Journal"). If such Market Exchange Rate is not available for any reason with respect to such currency, the Trustee or such foreign exchange agent appointed by the Company shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or, in the case of Euros, the rate of exchange as published in the Journal, as of the most recent available date, or quotations or, in the case of Euros, rates of exchange from one or more major banks in The City of New York or in the country of issue of the currency in question or, in the case of Euros, in Luxembourg or such other quotations or, in the case of Euros, rates of exchange as such foreign exchange agent appointed by the Company, upon consultation with the Company, shall deem appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply in determining the equivalent principal amount in respect of Securities of a Series denominated in currency other than Dollars in connection with any action taken by Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
 
All decisions and determinations of such foreign exchange agent appointed by the Company regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive to the extent permitted by law for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company and all Holders.
 
Section 10.16.
                      
JUDGMENT CURRENCY.
 
The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of or interest or other amount on the Securities of any Series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures such foreign exchange agent appointed by the Company could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a New York Banking Day, then, the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures such foreign exchange agent appointed by the Company could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (b) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (a)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable, and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture. For purposes of the foregoing, "New York Banking Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.

Section 10.18.
                      
SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.
 
THE COMPANY AND EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE GUARANTEES AND THE NOTES, AND IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS.  THE COMPANY AND EACH GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THAT IT MAY EFFECTIVELY DO SO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND ANY OBJECTION
WHICH MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE TRUSTEE OR ANY HOLDER OF THE NOTES TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST THE COMPANY OR GUARANTOR IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

Section 11.1.
                            
APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE.
 
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of the Securities of a Series, except as otherwise permitted or required by any form of Security of such Series issued pursuant to this Indenture.
 
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any Series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment" and any other amount provided for by the terms of Securities of such Series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any Series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 11.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any Series as provided for by the terms of the Securities of such Series.
 
Section 11.2.
                            
SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SECURITIES.
 
The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any Series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (1) deliver outstanding Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable (other than any of such Securities previously called for mandatory sinking fund redemption) and (2) apply as credit Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable and which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Series of Securities (except pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund) or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments or other optional
redemptions pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received by the Trustee, together with an Officers' Certificate with respect thereto, not later than 15 days prior to the date on which the Trustee begins the process of selecting Securities for redemption, and shall be credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. If as a result of the delivery or credit of Securities in lieu of cash payments pursuant to this Section 11.2, the principal amount of Securities of such Series to be redeemed in order to exhaust the aforesaid cash payment shall be less than $100,000, the Trustee need not call Securities of such Series for redemption, except upon receipt of a Company Order that such action be taken, and such cash payment shall be held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent and applied to the next succeeding sinking fund payment, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall from time to time upon receipt of a Company Order pay over and deliver to the Company any cash payment so being held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of Securities of that Series purchased by the Company having an unpaid principal amount equal to the cash payment required to be released to the Company.
 
Section 11.3.
                            
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND.
 
Not less than 45 days (unless otherwise indicated in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officers' Certificate in respect of a particular Series of Securities) prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment for that Series pursuant to the terms of that Series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting of Securities of that Series pursuant to Section 11.2, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not less than 30 days (unless otherwise indicated in the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture in respect of a particular Series of Securities) before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.2 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.3. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
 
Section 12.1.
                            
SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE.
 
Each Subsidiary that is a signatory hereto and each Subsidiary of the Company that in accordance with the terms of any Securities of a Series issued hereunder pursuant to any supplement indenture relating to such Securities is required to become party to this Indenture as a guarantor (each, a "Guarantor"), upon execution of a supplemental indenture, hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantees to each Securityholder of a Security of a Series that is to be guaranteed and that has been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee irrespective of the
validity or enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, that: (i) the principal of and interest on the Securities will be paid in full when due, whether at the maturity or interest payment or mandatory redemption date, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities and all other obligations of the Company to the Securityholders or the Trustee under this Indenture or the Securities will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Securities; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, each Guarantor will be obligated to pay the same whether or not such failure to pay has become an Event of Default which could cause acceleration pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment not a guarantee of collection.
 
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to this Subsidiary Guarantee shall be joint and several and unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, waives and relinquishes all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (a) any right to require the Trustee, the Securityholders or the Company (each, a "Benefited Party") to proceed against the Company or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by a Benefited Party at any time or to pursue any other remedy in any Benefited Party's power before proceeding against such Guarantor; (b) the defense of the statute of limitations in any action hereunder or in any action for the collection of any Indebtedness or the performance of any obligation hereby guaranteed; (c) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of any other Person or the failure of a Benefited Party to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other Person; (d) demand, protest and notice of any kind including but not limited to notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional Indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of such Guarantor, the Company, any Benefited Party, any creditor of such Guarantor, the Company or on the part of any other Person whomsoever in connection with any Indebtedness or obligations hereby guaranteed; (e) any defense based upon an election of remedies by a Benefited Party, including but not limited to an election to proceed against such Guarantor for reimbursement; (f) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (g) any defense arising because of a Benefited Party's election, in any proceeding instituted under Bankruptcy Law, of the application of 11 U.S.C. Section 1111(b)(2); or (h) any defense based on any borrowing or grant of a security interest under 11 U.S.C. Section 364. Each Guarantor hereby covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Indenture.
If any Securityholder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to either the Company or any Guarantor, or any Custodian acting in relation to either the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Securityholder, the applicable Subsidiary Guarantees, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated and be in full force and effect. Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Securityholders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
 
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Securityholders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration as to the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of those obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, those obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
Section 12.2.
                            
LIMITATION OF GUARANTOR'S LIABILITY.
 
Each Guarantor and, by its acceptance hereof, the Trustee and each Securityholder hereby confirm that it is its intention that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each such Person hereby irrevocably agrees that the obligation of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee under this Article XII shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or other) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article XII, result in the obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under said laws. The Trustee and each Securityholder by accepting the benefits hereof, confirms its intention that, in the event of a bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding of the Company or any Guarantor in which concurrent claims are made upon such Guarantor hereunder, to the extent such claims will not be fully satisfied, each such claimant with a valid claim against the Company shall be entitled to a ratable share of all payments by such Guarantor in respect of such concurrent claims. For all purposes of this Section 12.2, Senior Debt shall be deemed to have been incurred prior to the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the Subsidiary Guarantees.
 
Section 13.1.
                            
AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE.
 
The Company, the Trustee and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the indebtedness and obligations evidenced by the Security (a) rank PARI PASSU
with the Company's Obligations relating to the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities and any future Indebtedness ranking PARI PASSU with the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities and (b) are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article, to the prior payment in full, in cash, of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt of the Company.
 
Section 13.2.
                            
LIQUIDATION; DISSOLUTION; BANKRUPTCY.
 
Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company's assets and liabilities:
 
(1)
                                 
holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt of the Company (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt of the Company, whether or not allowed as a claim in such proceeding) before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution from the Company with respect to the Securities; and
 
(2)
                                 
until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Trustee or any Securityholder would be entitled but for this Article shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of the Company, as their interests may appear.
 
Section 13.3.
                            
DEFAULT ON DESIGNATED SENIOR DEBT.
 
The Company may not make any payment or distribution upon or in respect of the Securities, including, without limitation, by way of set-off or otherwise, or redeem (or make a deposit in redemption of), defease or acquire any of the Securities, for cash, properties or securities if:
 
(i)
                                    
a default in the payment of any principal, premium, if any, or interest or other Obligations (a "Payment Default") with respect to Senior Debt of the Company occurs and is continuing; or
 
(ii)
                                 
a default (other than a Payment Default) or any event that, after notice or passage of time would become a default (a "Non-Monetary Default"), on Senior Debt of the Company occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of the Senior Debt of the Company to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a Person who may give it pursuant to Section 13.11 hereof. Any number of such Payment Blockage Notices may be given, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) not more than one Payment Blockage Notice may be commenced during any period of 360 consecutive days and (ii) any Non-Monetary Default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any such notice to the Trustee (to the extent
the holder of Designated Senior Debt, or such trustee or agent, giving such Payment Blockage Notice had knowledge of the same) shall not be the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice, unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 days.
 
The Company may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Securities and all Obligations with respect thereto, and may acquire such Securities or Obligations upon the earlier of:
 
(1)
                                 
in the case of a payment default, the date upon which such default is cured or waived, or
 
(2)
                                 
in the case of a Non-Monetary Default, on the earlier of the date on which such Non-Monetary Default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, if the maturity of such Senior Debt of the Company has not been accelerated,
 
if this Article XIII otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time thereof.
 
Section 13.4.
                            
ACCELERATION OF SECURITIES.
 
If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify Representatives of the holders of Senior Debt of the Company of the acceleration.
 
Section 13.5.
                            
WHEN DISTRIBUTION MUST BE PAID OVER.
 
In the event that the Trustee or any Securityholder receives from the Company any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities at a time when the Trustee or such Securityholder, as applicable, has received written notice that such payment is prohibited by Section 13.2 or 13.3 hereof, subject to Section 13.11 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or such Securityholder in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to, the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, as their interests may appear, or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt of the Company may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt of the Company.
 
With respect to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article XIII, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt of the Company, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Securityholders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall
be entitled by virtue of this Article XIII, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
 
Section 13.6.
                            
NOTICE BY COMPANY.
 
The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Securities to the Senior Debt of the Company as provided in this Article.
 
Section 13.7.
                            
SUBROGATION.
 
After all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company are paid in full, in cash, and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness PARI PASSU with the Securities) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of the Company to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt of the Company to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Securityholders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt of the Company. A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt of the Company that otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the Company and Securityholders, a payment by the Company on the Securities.
 
Section 13.8.
                            
RELATIVE RIGHTS.
 
This Article defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Debt of the Company.  Nothing in this Indenture shall:
 
(1)
                                 
impair, as between the Company and Securityholders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms;
 
(2)
                                 
affect the relative rights of Securityholders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt of the Company; or
 
(3)
                                 
prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt of the Company to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Securityholders.
 
If the Company fails because of this Article XIII to pay principal of, premium or interest on a Security on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
 
Section 13.9.
                            
SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED BY COMPANY.
 
No right of any holder of Senior Debt of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Securityholder or by the failure of the Company or any Securityholder to comply with this Indenture.
Section 13.10.
                      
DISTRIBUTION OR NOTICE TO REPRESENTATIVE.
 
Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt of the Company, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
 
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article XIII, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt of the Company and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount or amounts thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XIII.
 
Section 13.11.
                      
RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE AND PAYING AGENT.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XIII or any other provision of this Indenture,  (i) the Trustee's rights to compensation, reimbursement of expenses and indemnification under Sections 7.7 and 6.6 hereof are expressly not subordinated; and (ii) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment a Payment Blockage Notice. Only the holders or the Representative of holders of Designated Senior Debt of the Company may give a Payment Blockage Notice. Nothing in this Article XIII shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.  Nothing in TIA Section 3.11 or elsewhere in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of its rights as such holder.
 
Section 13.12.
                      
AUTHORIZATION TO EFFECT SUBORDINATION.
 
Each Securityholder of a Security by the Securityholder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Securityholder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article XIII, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Securityholder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.4 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives of the Senior Debt of the Company are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Securityholders of the Securities.
 
Section 13.13.
                      
AMENDMENTS.
 
The provisions of this Article XIII shall not be amended or modified without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt of the Company.
Section 13.14.
                      
SUBORDINATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES.
 
Each Guarantor, the Trustee, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the indebtedness and obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees (a) rank PARI PASSU with the Guarantor's guarantees of the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities and any future Indebtedness ranking PARI PASSU with the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities and (b) are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article XIII, to the prior payment in full, in cash, of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
 
Section 13.15.
                      
LIQUIDATION; DISSOLUTION; BANKRUPTCY OF A GUARANTOR.
 
Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of any Guarantor in a liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of such Guarantor's assets and liabilities:
 
(1)
                                 
holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt of such Guarantor (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt of such Guarantor, whether or not allowed as a claim in such proceeding) before the Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution from the Guarantor with respect to such Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee; and
 
(2)
                                 
until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Trustee or any Securityholder would be entitled but for this Trustee shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, as their interests may appear.
 
Section 13.16.
                      
DEFAULT ON SENIOR DEBT OF THE GUARANTOR.
 
No Guarantor shall make any payment or distribution upon or in respect of the Securities or its Subsidiary Guarantee, including, without limitation, by way of set-off or otherwise, or redeem (or make a deposit in redemption of), defease or acquire any of the Securities, for cash, properties or securities if:
 
(i)
                                    
a Payment Default with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor occurs and is continuing; or
 
(ii)
                                 
a Non-Monetary Default on Senior Debt of such Guarantor occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of the Senior Debt of such Guarantor to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a Payment Blockage Notice from a Person who may give it pursuant to Section 13.24 hereof. Any number of such Payment Blockage Notices may be given, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
 
not more than one Payment Blockage Notice may be commenced during any period of 360 consecutive days and (ii) any default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee (to the extent the holder of Designated Senior Debt, or such trustee or agent, giving such Payment Blockage Notice had knowledge of the same) shall not be the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to Section 13.24 herein, unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
 
Each Guarantor may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of its Subsidiary Guarantee, the Securities and all Obligations with respect thereto, and may acquire such Securities or Obligations upon the earlier of:
 
(1)
                                 
in the case of a payment default, the date upon which such default is cured or waived, or
 
(2)
                                 
in the case of a Non-Monetary Default, on the earlier of the date on which such Non-Monetary Default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, if the maturity of such Senior Debt of such Guarantor has not been accelerated,
 
if this Article XIII otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time thereof.
 
Section 13.17.
                      
ACCELERATION OF SECURITIES; DUTIES OF GUARANTORS.

Section 13.18.
                      
WHEN DISTRIBUTION FROM GUARANTOR MUST BE PAID OVER.
 
In the event that the Trustee or any Securityholder receives from a Guarantor any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or the Subsidiary Guarantees at a time when the Trustee or such Securityholder, as applicable, has received written notice that such payment is prohibited by Section 13.15 or 13.16 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or such Securityholder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to, the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, as their interests may appear, or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt of such Guarantor may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
 
With respect to the holders of Senior Debt of any Guarantor, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article XIII, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior
Debt of such Guarantor shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Securityholders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor shall be entitled by virtue of this Article XIII, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
 
Section 13.19.
                      
NOTICE BY A GUARANTOR.
 
Each Guarantor shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent in writing of any facts known to such Guarantor that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or its Subsidiary Guarantee to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of its Subsidiary Guarantee or of the Securities to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor as provided in this Article XIII.
 
Section 13.20.
                      
SUBROGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
With respect to any Guarantor, after all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, in cash, and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness PARI PASSU with such Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt of such Guarantor to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Securityholders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt of such Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor that otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between such Guarantor and Securityholders, a payment by such Guarantor on the Securities or the Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
Section 13.21.
                      
RELATIVE RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
This Article defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Debt of each Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
 
(1)
                                 
impair, as between such Guarantor and the Securityholders, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with the terms of its Subsidiary Guarantee;
 
(2)
                                 
affect the relative rights of Securityholders and creditors of such Guarantor other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor; or
 
(3)
                                 
prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor set forth herein to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Securityholders.
If any Guarantor fails because of this Article XIII to pay principal of, premium or interest on a Security on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
 
Section 13.22.
                      
SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED BY ANY GUARANTOR.
 
With respect to any Guarantor, no right of any holder of Senior Debt of such Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Guarantor or any Securityholder or by failure of such Guarantor or any Securityholder to comply with this Indenture.
 
Section 13.23.
                      
DISTRIBUTION OR NOTICE TO REPRESENTATIVE WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
With respect to any Guarantor, whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt of such Guarantor, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
 
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of any Guarantor referred to in this Article XIII, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt of such Guarantor and other Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount or amounts thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XIII.
 
Section 13.24.
                      
RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE AND PAYING AGENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XIII or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment a Payment Blockage Notice. Only the Representative of holders of Designated Senior Debt may give a Payment Blockage Notice. Nothing in this Article XIII shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.
 
With respect to any Guarantor, the Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt of such Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
 
Section 13.25.
                      
AUTHORIZATION TO EFFECT SUBORDINATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
Each Securityholder of a Security by the Securityholder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Securityholder's behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article XIII, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Securityholder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding relative to any Guarantor referred to in Section 6.4 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives of Senior Debt of such Guarantor are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Securityholders of the Securities.
 
Section 13.26.
                      
AMENDMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY GUARANTOR.
 
With respect to any Guarantor, the provisions of Section 13.14 through 13.26 hereof shall not be amended or modified without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the date and year first written above.

such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after October 1, 1996 is less than (x) the cumulative EBITDA of the Company, minus 1.75 times the cumulative Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company, in each case for the period (taken as one accounting period) from June 30, 1996, to the end of the Company's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, plus (y) the aggregate net Equity Proceeds received by the Company from the issuance or sale since October 1, 1996 of Equity Interests of the Company or of debt securities of the Company that have been converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests or convertible debt securities sold to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and other than Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock), plus (z) $2.0 million.
 
The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:
 
(1)
          
the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;
 
(2)
          
the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Stock);
 
(3)
          
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially
concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock);
 
(4)
          
the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issue and sale (other than to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Refinancing Indebtedness;
 
(5)
          
the repurchase of any Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions similar to the covenant set forth in Section 4.18 of the Indenture, provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such repurchase the Company has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such Change of Control Offer; and
 
(6)
          
additional payments to current or former employees or directors of the Company for repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests, provided that the aggregate amount of all such payments under this clause (6) does not exceed $0.5 million in any year and $2.0 million in the aggregate.
 
The Restricted Payments described in clauses (2), (3), (5) and (6) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph but shall reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section, and the Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) and (4) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be Restricted Payments that shall be permitted to be taken in accordance with such paragraph and shall not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
 
If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision shall be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in the Company's EBITDA; , , that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such Investment.  In addition, for the avoidance of doubt and to avoid double counting, if an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, then the subsequent assignment, contribution, distribution or other transfer of such Investment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be considered a new Investment or Restricted Payment and shall not further reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section.
provided
however
 
If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments.
For the purpose of making any Restricted Payment calculations under the Indenture:
 
(1)
          
Investments shall include the fair market value of the net assets of any Restricted Subsidiary at the time that such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary and shall exclude the fair market value of the net assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case with fair market value determined by the Board of Directors in good faith and, for the avoidance of doubt, such inclusions and exclusions will not be limited by the amount of any Investment or aggregate Investments;
 
(2)
          
any asset or property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be valued at fair market value at the time of such transfer, provided that, in each case, the fair market value of an asset or property is as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith and, for the avoidance of doubt, the fair market value (as so determined) of such asset of property shall be subtracted from (in the case of a transfer to an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or added to (in the case of a transfer from an Unrestricted Subsidiary) the calculation under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this Section; and
 
(3)
          
subject to the foregoing, the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, shall be determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive.
 
The Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with Section 4.15 of the Indenture.  Upon such designation, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this Section 4.8.  Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

4.9.    The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guaranty or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Company shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; , that the Company may incur Indebtedness and may permit a Restricted Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness if at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto the Leverage Ratio would be less than 6.5 to 1.0.
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
.
provided, however
 
The foregoing limitations shall not apply to:
 
(1)
          
the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Senior Bank Debt in an aggregate amount not to exceed $790.0 million at any one time outstanding;
 
(2)
          
the issuance by the Restricted Subsidiaries of Subsidiary Guarantees;
 
(3)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;
(4)
          
the issuance by the Company of the Notes;
 
(5)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Lease Obligations and/or additional Indebtedness constituting purchase money obligations up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding, provided that the Liens securing such Indebtedness constitute Permitted Liens;
 
(6)
          
the incurrence of Indebtedness between (i) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(7)
          
Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business, , in the case of Hedging Obligations with respect to Indebtedness, that such Indebtedness is permitted to be outstanding by the terms of the Indenture;
provided
 
(8)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising out of letters of credit, performance bonds, surety bonds and bankers' acceptances incurred in the ordinary course of business up to an aggregate of $5.0 million at any one time outstanding;
 
(9)
          
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting of guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of Capital Stock;
 
(10)
        
the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Refinancing Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to repay, redeem, defease, extend, refinance, renew, replace or refund, Indebtedness referred to in clauses (2) through (5) above, and this clause (10) or that was otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 4.9; and
 
(11)
        
the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (11), not to exceed $50.0 million.
 
For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.9, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted debt described in clauses (1) through (11) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 4.9, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 4.9. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 4.9; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company as accrued. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent
principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.9, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
 
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
 
(1)
          
the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;
 
(2)
          
the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
 
(3)
          
in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
 
(i)
           
the fair market value of such assets at the date of determination; and
 
(ii)
          
the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
 
(c)
          
Liens
.
 
4.10.  .  Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (a) in the case of any Lien securing any Indebtedness that is subordinate to the Notes, the Notes are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Lien and (b) in the case of any other Lien, the Notes are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

(d)

4.11.  .  The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries
 
(1)
          
(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (A) on its Capital Stock or (B) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
 
(2)
          
make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or
 
(3)
          
transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
 
However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(1)
          
Existing Indebtedness;
 
(2)
          
the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancing thereof, provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of the Indenture;
 
(3)
          
the Indenture and the Notes;
 
(4)

(8)
          
permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;
 
(9)
          
any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary provided that (i) at the time such agreement or instrument is entered into, such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries have a Leverage Ratio of less than 6.5 to 1.0 and (ii) neither such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) unless at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto, the Leverage Ratio for such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be less than 6.5 to 1.0.  For purposes of determining the Leverage Ratio under this clause (9) only, all references to the "Company" and its "Restricted Subsidiaries" or similar references in the definition of "Leverage Ratio" and other defined terms necessary to determine the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to refer to such Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries, respectively; or
(10)
        
agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of Section 4.9 and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; that the restrictions therein are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Indenture, the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Transactions with Affiliates
 
(1)
          
such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a non-Affiliated Person; and
 
(2)
          
the Company delivers to the Trustee:
 
(i)
           
with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of $10.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above and such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors; and
 
(ii)
          
with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of $25.0 million, an opinion as to the fairness to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view issued by an investment banking, appraisal or accounting firm of national standing.
 
The following items shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

No Restricted Subsidiary (including any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) shall consolidate (or for the avoidance of doubt, amalgamate) with or merge with or into (whether or not such Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company) whether or not affiliated with such Restricted Subsidiary unless:
 
(1)
          
subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation (or amalgamation) or merger (if other than such Restricted Subsidiary) assumes all the obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee (except in the case of an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;
 
(2)
          
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
 
(3)
          
such Restricted Subsidiary, or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation (or amalgamation) or merger, would be permitted to incur, immediately after giving effect to such transaction, at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of Section 4.9 of the Indenture.
 
In the event of:
 
(1)
          
a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of any Restricted Subsidiary, by way of merger, consolidation (or amalgamation) or otherwise;
 
(2)

(3)

then such Restricted Subsidiary (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger, consolidation (or amalgamation) or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Restricted Subsidiary or in the event of the designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or the Person acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, provided that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 4.17 of the Indenture.

Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries

4.15.
         
Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries

(1)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary;
 
(2)
          
no default with respect to any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary would permit (upon notice, lapse of time or otherwise) any holder of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to declare a default on such other Indebtedness or cause the payment thereof to be accelerated or payable prior to its stated maturity;
 
(3)
          
any Investment in such Subsidiary deemed to be made as a result of designating such Subsidiary an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not violate the provisions of Section 4.8 of the Indenture;
 
(4)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has a contract, agreement, arrangement, understanding or obligation of any kind, whether written or oral, with such Subsidiary other than (i) those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company or (ii) administrative, tax sharing and other ordinary course contracts, agreements, arrangements and understandings or obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business; and
 
(5)
          
neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for additional shares of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, or to maintain or preserve such Subsidiary's financial condition or to cause such Subsidiary to achieve certain levels of operating results other than as permitted under Section 4.8 of the Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not designate as an Unrestricted Subsidiary any Subsidiary which, on April 26, 1999, was a Significant Subsidiary, and may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets of any such Significant Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case other than Iron Mountain Global, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (including without limitation Iron Mountain Europe Limited and its Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 4.15 shall not limit or restrict the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets to any other Subsidiary, including any Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent such sale, transfer or other disposition is permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described under Section 4.12 or Section 4.17.
The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if:
 
(1)
          
such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.9 of the Indenture; and
 
(2)
          
no Default or Event of Default would occur as a result of such designation.

(1)
          
the consideration received in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is at least equal to the fair market value of the property sold, as determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and
 
(2)
          
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could incur the Attributable Indebtedness in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction in compliance with Section 4.9 of the Indenture.

Asset Sales

(1)
          
sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction, but excluding a Qualifying Sale and Leaseback Transaction) other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business (provided that the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.18 of the Indenture and/or the provisions of Section 5.1 of the Indenture and not by the provisions of this Section 4.17); or
 
(2)
          
issue or sell Equity Interests of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
 
that in the case of either clause (1) or (2) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions:
 
(i)
           
have a fair market value in excess of $2.0 million; or
 
(ii)
          
result in Net Proceeds in excess of $2.0 million (each of the foregoing, an "Asset Sale") unless (x) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and for Asset Sales having a fair market value or resulting in Net Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million, evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents,
 
like-kind assets or other assets used in or useful in the Company's business (in each case as determined in good faith by the Company, evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors and certified by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee);
provided
, , that the amount of:
however
 
(A)
         
any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets; and
 
(B)
          
any notes or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are immediately converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) or Cash Equivalents,
 
shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and provided, further, that the 75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (ii) (y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.  For the avoidance of doubt, a disposition that constitutes a Restricted Payment will be governed by the provisions of Section 4.8 and not by this Section 4.17.
 
A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by the Company to a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary or by a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to another Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an Asset Sale.
 
Within 360 days of any Asset Sale, the Company may, at its option, apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either:
 
(1)
          
to permanently reduce Senior Debt; or
 
(2)
          
to an investment in a Restricted Subsidiary or in another business or capital expenditure or other long-term/tangible assets, in each case, in the same line of business as the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries was engaged in on the date of this Supplemental Indenture or in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto.
 
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Bank Debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.  Any Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds."  When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes, all holders of the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities and the holders of any future Indebtedness ranking with the Notes, which Indebtedness contains similar provisions requiring the Company to repurchase such Indebtedness (an "Asset Sale Offer"), to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
pari passu
 
Indenture.  To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Indebtedness (including the Existing Senior Subordinated Securities) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes.  If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
pari passu
pro rata
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.17, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
 
An Asset Sale Offer shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.9 hereof.  No later than the date which is five Business Days after the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Asset Sale Offer and provide the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate setting forth the calculations used in determining the amount of Net Proceeds to be applied to the purchase of Notes.  The Company shall commence or cause to be commenced the Asset Sale Offer on a date no later than 15 Business Days after such notice (the "Commencement Date").

The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the repurchase of the Notes in connection with a Change of Control.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 4.18, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.18 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon copies of: (i) the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the By-Laws, as amended, of the Company; (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or Certificate of Organization, as amended, and the By-Laws, as amended, or other organizational documents of the Delaware Guarantors; (iii) the Registration Statement, (iv) the final Prospectus dated June 28, 2010 (the "") relating to the Registration Statement, (v) the final Prospectus Supplement to the Base Prospectus to be dated on or about September 23, 2011 relating to the Notes (the "" and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented thereby, the ""), (vi) the Base Indenture and the description of the Indenture in the Prospectus Supplement, (vii) certificates of good standing of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors issued by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (viii) resolutions adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors, resolutions adopted by the Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee of the Board of Directors and resolutions adopted by the sole director of one of the Delaware Guarantors,  each relating to the Notes and/or the Subsidiary Guarantees, as the case may be.  We have assumed, for purposes of this opinion, the genuineness of all signatures, the authority of persons signing documents examined by us by or on behalf of parties thereto (except in the case of persons signing on behalf of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors), the
Base Prospectus

authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies which facts we have not independently verified and, subject to the limitations set forth below, have examined such questions of law and such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering the opinions set forth below.  We have also assumed that each Note conforms to the form thereof examined by us and the Supplemental Indenture conforms to the description thereof in the Prospectus Supplement.  We have relied, as to certain factual matters, upon representations of the Company and the Guarantors in the agreements referred to in the preceding paragraph, upon certificates or representations of officers of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors believed by us to be reasonable and upon certificates of public officials, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy and completeness of such certificates and representations.
 
We have also assumed in connection with the opinion expressed below that: (i) each of the Connecticut Guarantors is a Connecticut Statutory Trust, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, (ii) each Connecticut Guarantor has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to issue and offer the Subsidiary Guarantees and enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and the issuance of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be issued from time to time and the terms and conditions thereof and of the Indenture, and the execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantees by each Connecticut Guarantor is duly authorized and approved on behalf of such Connecticut Guarantor (such approvals referred to herein as the "") and (iii) the Proceedings, the issuance of the Subsidiary Guarantees and the terms and conditions of the Indenture will be (A) in accordance with applicable laws and the governing documents of each of the Connecticut Guarantors and (B) not in conflict with any contractual or other restrictions which are binding on any such Connecticut Guarantor.
Proceedings
 
We have assumed for purposes of this opinion that the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by, the Indenture.  We have also assumed that the Trustee has all requisite organizational and legal power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, that the Trustee is in compliance, generally with respect to acting as a trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations, that the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture, and that the Indenture will be the valid and binding agreement of the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms.
 
This opinion is limited solely to the laws of the State of New York, as applied by courts located in the State of New York, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applied by courts located in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal laws of the United States of America, to the extent that the same may apply to or govern such transactions, and the corporate and limited liability company laws of the State of Delaware to the extent indicated in this paragraph. Although we are not admitted to practice before the Bar of the State of Delaware, we are generally familiar with the laws of the State of Delaware pertaining to corporate and limited liability company matters, and, to the extent that conclusions based on the laws of the State of Delaware are involved in the opinions set forth herein, we have relied in part, in rendering such opinions, upon our examination of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act as currently in effect, including the statutory provisions, all applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting the
 
foregoing, and on our knowledge of interpretations of analogous laws of the State of New York. We express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws. Insofar as this opinion involves matters of Connecticut law with respect to the Connecticut Guarantors we have, with your permission, relied solely on the opinion of Gesmer Updegrove LLP dated September 20, 2011, a copy of which we understand you are filing herewith as Exhibit 5.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company of even date herewith (the ""), and our opinion is subject to the exceptions, qualifications and limitations therein expressed.  The opinions expressed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, insofar as they relate to the good standing of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors under the laws of the State of Delaware are based solely on certificates from appropriate state authorities to such effect.
8-K
 
Our opinion set forth below with respect to the validity or binding effect of the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees or any other obligations is subject to (i) limitations arising under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement generally of the rights and remedies of creditors and secured parties or the obligations of debtors, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), including, without limitation, the discretion of any court of competent jurisdiction in granting specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief, and (iii) an implied duty on the part of the party seeking to enforce rights or remedies to take action and make determinations on a reasonable basis and in good faith to the extent required by applicable law.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof:
 
1.             The Company and each of the Delaware Guarantors is a corporation or limited liability company, as the case may be, duly formed and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware and is in good standing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; and
 
2.             The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Company and the Delaware Guarantors, respectively and, when (i) the Indenture shall have been duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto and (ii) the Notes have been (A) duly executed and delivered by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, and (B) duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor, as provided in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Indenture, will constitute validly issued and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms.
 
The opinions set forth herein are rendered as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update such opinions to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in the law which may hereafter occur.  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company, which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to references to this firm under the caption "Validity of the Offered Securities" in the Base Prospectus and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement.  In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In our capacity as the Connecticut Guarantors' special counsel we have reviewed the documents listed in , attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The documents listed in , inclusive, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "."
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
Documents
 
This opinion is based entirely on our review of the Documents.  We have made no other documentary review or investigation of any kind whatsoever for purposes of this opinion.
 
For purposes of this opinion we have assumed the genuineness of all other signatures,
 
 
(other than on behalf of the Connecticut Guarantors) the genuiness of all documents reviewed by us that are presented to us as either originals or copies, the authenticity and completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original or copy form and the legal competence of each individual executing any document.  We have also assumed that each Note conforms to the form thereof as examined by us, and the Supplemental Indenture conforms to the description thereof in the Prospectus Supplement (defined below).  We have relied, as to certain factual matters, upon representations of the Connecticut Guarantors in the Documents, upon certificates or representations of the owner trustees of the 98 Trust, 99 Trust and 2001 Trust, respectively, and upon certificates of public officials, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy and completeness of such certificates and representations.
 
We have assumed for purposes of this opinion that the Company and Trustee are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, and are duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture.  We have also assumed that the Company and Trustee have all requisite organizational and legal power and authority to execute, deliver and perform their obligations under the Indenture, and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, that the Company and Trustee are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, that the Company and Trustee have duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture, and that the Indenture is and will be the valid and binding agreement of the Company and Trustee, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms.
 
We assume you know and understand that we represent the Connecticut Guarantors only, that we do not represent the Company, and although we have represented the Connecticut Guarantors from time to time in connection with various matters, we do not act as general counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors.  Further, we are not necessarily familiar with the day-to-day operations of any of the Connecticut Guarantors.  There may be other matters that are handled by other counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors, with respect to which we have not been consulted and of which we have no knowledge.
 
This opinion is limited solely to the laws of the State of Connecticut, as applied by courts located in the State of Connecticut.  To the extent that the foregoing laws may apply to or govern the transactions described above, we express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws.  The opinions expressed below, insofar as they relate to the good standing of the Connecticut Guarantors under the laws of the State of Connecticut, are based solely on certificates from the Connecticut Secretary of State.  For purposes of the opinions set forth herein, we have assumed, with your permission, that the laws of the State of Connecticut will apply to all transactions, agreements and matters set forth herein.
 
In rendering this opinion we assume that the execution of all documents on behalf of all entities and persons other than the Connecticut Guarantors was duly authorized and that such documents were validly executed and delivered on behalf of such entities and persons.
 
Our opinion is further subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and assumptions:
 
(a)           We express no opinion on the enforceability of the Indenture, as it relates to any party other than the Connecticut Guarantors;
 
(b)           The transactions described in the Indenture, Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated June 28, 2010 relating to the Registration Statement (the "") and the final prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus dated September 20, 2011 (the "", and together with the Base Prospectus collectively the "") may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, marshaling or other laws and rules of law affecting the enforcement generally of creditors' rights and remedies (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers of debtors' or guarantors' rights); and we express no opinion as to the status under any fraudulent conveyance laws or fraudulent transfer laws of any of the obligations of, or any security interest granted by the Connecticut Guarantors, or any other person, whether under the Indenture or otherwise;
Base Prospectus
Prospectus Supplement
Prospectus
 
(c)           The transaction described in the Indenture, Registration Statement and Prospectus may be subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and will be subject to a duty to act in a commercially reasonable manner. We have assumed that, in connection with any proceeding all parties will act in good faith, with diligence and in compliance with statutory requirements;
 
(d)           We express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring, circumstances arising, or changes of law becoming effective or occurring, after the date hereof on the matters addressed in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to inform you of additional or changed facts, or changes in law, of which we may become aware;
 
(e)           We express no opinion with respect to any matter involving financial information or relating to compliance with financial covenants or financial requirements; and
 
(f)            The opinions set forth below do not apply to the extent that judicial decisions may permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify the terms or the interpretation of any of the documents or agreements identified herein, or to the extent that judicial decisions may make certain provisions of agreements unenforceable where their enforcement would violate the implied covenant of fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable, or where their breach is not material.
 
Based on the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, and subject to the qualifications and exceptions herein contained, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.     Each of the Connecticut Guarantors is a Connecticut statutory trust, and duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut.
 
2.     Upon execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture and the guaranties executed by the Connecticut Guarantors (collectively the ""), such Guaranties shall have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of them.
Guaranties
 
3.     Upon execution and delivery of the Guaranties, such Guaranties shall constitute validly issued and binding obligations of the Connecticut Guarantors, enforceable against the respective Connecticut Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinions above relate only to laws and regulations, and consents, approvals, actions and filings required thereunder, which in our experience, are normally applicable to companies in the type of business engaged in by the Connecticut Guarantors.  Moreover, we express no opinion as to any consent, approval, action or filing, or violation of law, (i) which may be required as a result of your involvement in the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement or Prospectus because of your legal or regulatory status or because of any other facts specifically pertaining to you; or (ii) which, under Connecticut's blue-sky laws, could be readily obtained without significant delay or expense to you, without loss to you of any material benefit under the Indenture or Prospectus and without any material adverse effect on you or the Connecticut Guarantors during the period such consent, approval, action or filing was not obtained or effected.
 
We render or imply no opinion with respect to compliance with any federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, including without limitation, those relating to registration, filing, anti-fraud, or which relate to the accuracy or completeness of disclosure.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of Connecticut and we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of Connecticut.
 
We are not opining on specialized laws relating to tax, insolvency, antitrust, pension, employee benefit, environmental, intellectual property, banking, insurance, labor, health and safety and securities laws.  We are also not opining on federal law or the law of any county, municipality or other political subdivision or local governmental agency or authority.
 
We undertake no obligation to advise you of facts or changes in law occurring after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
 
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely in connection with the transactions under the Indenture and Prospectus.  You may not rely on this opinion letter in any other connection.  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company of even date herewith, which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to references to this firm under the caption "Validity of the Offered Securities" in the Base Prospectus and "Legal Matters" in the
 
Prospectus Supplement.  In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
