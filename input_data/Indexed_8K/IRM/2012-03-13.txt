Adoption of Severance Plan
 
On March 7, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company") adopted The Iron Mountain Companies Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") and The Iron Mountain Companies Severance Plan Severance Program No. 1 ("Severance Program No. 1"). The Severance Plan, which includes Severance Program No. 1, is part of The Iron Mountain Companies Welfare Plan, a welfare plan subject to ERISA.  The Severance Plan is designed to be the foundation for one or more severance programs that are adopted by Iron Mountain from time to time.  Each severance program defines the actual benefits available in a particular severance scenario.
 
"Eligible employees" under Severance Program No. 1 are Harold Ebbighausen, Brian McKeon and certain non-executive officers of the Company. In the event an eligible employee is involuntarily terminated by the Company (other than for "Cause," as defined in the Severance Plan) or in the event an eligible employee quits for "Good Reason," he or she is generally entitled to the following benefits, among others:
 
                                         
Cash compensation consisting of one year's base salary and a bonus payment generally equal to the annual target bonus for the officer for the year of termination multiplied by his or her average payout percentage over the prior three years.
 
                                         
If a qualifying termination occurs within 18 months of the start date of a Chief Executive Officer that replaces C. Richard Reese, credit for an additional 12 months of vesting service as of the termination date for unvested equity compensation arrangements (including, for example, options and restricted stock units).  Additional months of vesting service will be credited to the extent necessary to fully vest earned but not delivered performance units.
 
                                         
The Company's payment of (i) the employer share of the cost of medical and dental coverage until the earlier of (a) the first anniversary the employee's termination and (b) the date on which COBRA coverage ends, and (ii) outplacement for nine months following termination.
 
"Good Reason," as defined in Severance Program No. 1, means that the Company has, without the officer's consent, (a) materially diminished the sum of his or her base compensation plus target non-equity incentive compensation, (b) required him or her to be based at an office or primary work location that is greater than 50 miles from his or her current office or primary work location or (c) materially diminished his or her responsibilities and/or assigned him or her to duties and responsibilities that are generally inconsistent with his or her position with the Company prior to the change.
 
The benefits described above are contingent on the employee signing, returning and not revoking a release and confidentiality/noncompetition agreement.  To the extent an employee is entitled to payments under another Company plan, program or arrangement, benefits under the Severance Plan and Severance Program No. 1 are reduced.
 
The foregoing description of the Severance Plan and Severance Program No. 1 is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Severance Plan and Severance Program No. 1, which are incorporated by reference as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In addition, on March 7, 2012, the Committee also approved amending Marc Duale's employment agreement to provide to Mr. Duale severance benefits substantially the same as those provided to other officers pursuant to the Severance Plan and Severance Program No. 1 described above.
 
Grant of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units
 
On March 9, 2012, the Committee granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance units ("PUs") under the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "SIP"), to certain employees of the Company, including its named executive officers.  In particular, C. Richard Reese received grants of 77,976 RSUs and 77,976 PUs.  Other than changes in the number of RSUs and PUs granted and in the targets for revenue growth and return on invested capital, the terms and conditions of the RSUs and PUs granted to the Company's employees were substantially the same as prior grants, except with respect to Mr. Reese.  In contemplation of the anticipated transition to a new Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Reese's RSUs will continue to vest over the three-year period, even if Mr. Reese is no longer employed by, or otherwise provides services to, the Company.  In addition, it is not a condition of Mr. Reese's PUs that he be employed by, or otherwise provide services to, the Company at the end of the Performance Period or on the date of subsequent vesting in order for him to receive his PUs.

(b)           For the avoidance of doubt, a Participant shall not be eligible for Severance Benefits if the Participant is terminated by Iron Mountain for Cause or if the Participant quits (unless the Participant quits for Good Reason and the Severance Program applicable to the Participant permits Severance Benefits under such circumstances).

(i)

The Participant must sign, and not revoke, if applicable, within the period specified therein, a Separation and Release Agreement, and if provided for under the applicable Severance Program, an Employee Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement and any other agreement(s), in each case, in a form satisfactory to the Company.
 
3.2          .  A Participant's Severance Benefits, including Severance Pay, will be the amount determined under the applicable Severance Program for the Participant's position in effect as of the date of the Qualifying Termination.
Severance Benefits
 
3.3          .  Payments hereunder will be made as follows.
Time and Manner of Payment
 
(a)           Payments of Severance Pay will be made in equal installments over the Severance Period (or such other period as specified in the applicable Severance Program) in accordance with Iron Mountain's regular payroll intervals applicable to the Participant immediately prior to the Qualifying Termination.  Such payments will commence as of the first regular payroll date following the Qualifying Termination; provided, however, that no payment will be made earlier than the sixtieth day following a Qualifying Termination if the Participant is required to execute a Separation and Release Agreement; and provided, further, that any applicable revocation period will have expired before any payment.
 
(b)           All Severance Benefits shall be subject to applicable federal, state, local and other tax withholding as required by law.
(c)           Any payments due hereunder for Severance Pay shall be reduced by any other severance or termination payment due to a Participant, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, any amounts paid pursuant to federal, state or local government worker notification (, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act) or office closing requirements, any amounts paid pursuant to a SUB Pay Plan, any amounts owed a Participant pursuant to a contract with Iron Mountain and amounts paid to a Participant placed in a temporary layoff status (often referred to as a furlough), which immediately precedes the commencement of Severance Benefits hereunder.  In addition, to the extent any federal, state or local government regulation provides for payments related to accrued wages, bonuses, commissions, reimbursements, vacation pay or other benefits in an amount or manner different from Iron Mountain's policies and programs, including this Plan, any payments hereunder for Severance Pay shall be offset by such amounts.
e.g.
 
3.4          .  If a Participant entitled to Severance Benefits is reinstated, he or she will not be required to reimburse Iron Mountain or an Acquiror for any payments received hereunder prior to being rehired.  Any unpaid Severance Pay will be forfeited upon a Participant's rehire by Iron Mountain or an Acquiror.
Rehire
 
3.5          .  A Participant who receives payments hereunder for Severance Pay shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any such payments by seeking other employment or otherwise, and subject to Section 3.4 hereof, no such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation provided to the Participant in any subsequent employment.
Subsequent Employment
 
3.6          .  In addition to the Severance Benefits under this Plan, a Participant who experiences a Qualifying Termination shall be entitled to: (a) accrued wages due through the date of the Qualifying Termination in accordance with Iron Mountain's normal payroll practices; (b) any accrued but unused vacation pay; and (c) reimbursement for any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred by the Participant prior to the date of the Qualifying Termination in accordance with Iron Mountain's policy (and for which the Participant has submitted any required documentation).  In addition, a Participant that is subject to a commission plan or arrangement shall receive all commissions properly earned, but not yet paid, in accordance with the terms of such plan or arrangement.  All payments shall be subject to proper tax withholding.
Accrued Wages and Expense Reimbursements
 
3.7          .  Iron Mountain may deduct (after all applicable tax withholdings have been deducted) from payments hereunder any indebtedness, obligation or liability owed by the Participant as of his or her date of termination
Settlement of Accounts
, as permitted under applicable law.
 
4.1           .  This Severance Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on Iron Mountain any obligation to retain any Eligible Employee as an
Employment Status
employee or to change any employment policies of any Iron Mountain entity.  Upon a Qualifying Termination hereunder, an Eligible Employee will thereafter cease to be an employee for any and all purposes.
 
4.2          .  The Company, by action of its Executive Vice President, Human Resources, reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend or terminate this Severance Plan; provided, however, that with respect to the provisions of the Severance Plan and any Severance Program that may apply to the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall have such authority; and provided, further, that subsequent to any Closing Date, the Plan and each of the Severance Programs, all as in effect at the Closing Date, shall be maintained in substance and effect for at least eighteen months following any Closing Date, subject only to administrative, process or other amendments or changes that do not materially affect the rights of Eligible Employees hereunder.  In the event a Change in Control is structured as a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Company will negotiate for the Acquirer to assume and perform the obligations set forth in this Plan.
Right to Amend or Terminate
 
4.3          .  Without limiting the provisions of Articles 11 and 12 of the Welfare Plan, the determination of whether a Participant has experienced a Qualifying Termination, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, whether a termination is for Cause or Good Reason, will be made by the Administrator, in his, her or its sole and absolute discretion, and such determination will be conclusive and binding on the Participant.
Plan Interpretation
 
4.4          .  In the event of a large scale reduction in force and except as otherwise limited by Section 4.2, the Company reserves the right, on its behalf and on behalf of all Affiliated Employers, to reduce, due to economic factors, the benefits set forth in Article 3 of the Severance Plan.
Large Scale Reduction in Force
 
4.5          .  It is the intention of the parties that no payment or entitlement pursuant to this Plan will give rise to any adverse tax consequences to any person pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  The Administrator shall interpret and apply the Plan to that end, shall treat a series of installment payments as separate payments (as permitted under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(2)) and shall not give effect to any provision herein in a manner that reasonably could be expected to give rise to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require Iron Mountain to provide a Participant with any gross-up for any tax, interest or penalty that may be incurred under Section 409A of the Code or otherwise.  Any reimbursements due or expenses to be paid under any provision of this Severance Plan shall be paid not later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the expense is incurred.  In the case of any payment on termination (other than in compliance with the requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or (v) or of any successor thereto or any other provision that exempts a payment from Section 409A of the Code and other than any payment that is a "short-term deferral" within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)) while a Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, in no event will such payment be made earlier than six months after the Participant's "separation from service" within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(h).  In the event that, due to Section 409A of the Code, a Participant does not receive one or more cash payments that would otherwise be due during that six month period, all such delayed payments will be made on the first day after the six-month anniversary of his or her "separation
Section 409A of the Code
from service" within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(h), and thereafter any remaining payments shall be made in accordance with any existing schedule.
 
4.6          .  Nothing herein shall require Iron Mountain to provide a Participant with any gross-up for any tax, interest or penalty that may be incurred under Section 4999 of the Code or otherwise with respect to any excess parachute payment.
Section 4999 of the Code
Severance Program No. 1

Exhibit 10.2
 
The purpose of this Program is to specify the benefits available to certain employees of Iron Mountain Incorporated and/or its Affiliated Employers in the event of their Qualifying Termination.
 
This document is a part of The Iron Mountain Companies Severance Plan, which itself is part of The Iron Mountain Companies Welfare Plan, and is part of the summary plan description for the Welfare Plan.  This document provides an overview of the benefits available and must be read in conjunction with the Severance Plan where, for example, certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined below are defined and the Welfare Plan where, for example, claims procedures are set forth.  In the event of an inconsistency between this document and the Severance and Welfare Plan documents, the Severance and Welfare Plan documents will govern.
 
The Severance Plan and this Severance Program No. 1 (the "Program') is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Administrator"), which shall act as the "named fiduciary" and "plan administrator" under ERISA with respect to this benefit.  The Administrator has the discretionary and final authority to make factual determinations, to construe and administer the Plan, to interpret any ambiguities and to resolve any and all issues including, without limitation, eligibility to participate and the right to any Severance Benefits.
 
This Program applies to the Eligible Employees who are identified by name as Participants on Exhibit A hereto ("Covered Employees").  The phrase Eligible Employee generally includes U.S. employees of Iron Mountain, other than temporary or irregular employees, union employees or contractors.  A Covered Employee must be regularly scheduled to work at least thirty hours a week and have been employed for ninety days as of his or her termination date.
 
A Covered Employee is eligible for Severance Benefits under the Severance Plan if he or she experiences a Qualifying Termination.  Qualifying Termination is defined in the Severance Plan but basically means that an individual's employment is involuntary terminated other than for Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan).  Under this Program, a Qualifying Termination also includes a termination by the Covered Employee of his or her employment for Good Reason.  Good Reason means that Iron Mountain has, without the Covered Employee's consent (and after notice and opportunity for correction), (a) materially diminished the sum of his or her base compensation plus target nonequity incentive compensation, (b) required the Covered Employee to be based at an office or primary work location that is greater than fifty miles from his or her current office or primary work location or (c) materially diminished the Covered Employee's responsibilities and/or assigned the Covered Employee to duties and responsibilities that are
 
generally inconsistent with his or her position with Iron Mountain prior to the change.  A termination for Good Reason must occur within six months of the Good Reason event but before a termination for Good Reason can be considered to be a Qualifying Termination, a Covered Employee must provide the Administrator with notice within ninety days of the existence of the Good Reason event and Iron Mountain shall have thirty days within which to remedy the issue.
 
3.1           .  The amount of Severance Pay payable under this Program is based on the Covered Employee's "Base Salary" and "Target Bonus Payment," and the "Severance Period," each as defined below.
Severance Pay
 
(a)           Severance Period shall be the fifty-two week period following a Covered Employee's Qualifying Termination.
 
(b)           Base Salary is the Covered Employee's weekly or biweekly (as applicable) rate of pay as of the date of termination without regard to other forms of compensation, such as overtime, bonuses or equity compensation.  A Covered Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination will receive an amount equal to fifty-two weeks of Base Salary or that number of weeks that remain between the Qualifying Termination and a previously announced termination date by the Covered Employee.
 
(c)           A Covered Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination will also receive a Target Bonus Payment equal to the amount of the annual target bonus that would have been paid had he or she remained employed for the entire year of termination multiplied by his or her average payout percentage based upon financial performance and individual performance goals over the prior three years (or full years of employment if not employed for a full three years).  (If the annual bonus for the year of termination has not yet been determined as of the Covered Employee's termination, the annual target bonus for the prior year shall be used.)
 
Example:  Stuart is eligible for an annual bonus for 2013 equal to 60% of Stuart's Base Salary, which is currently $300,000.  Over the last three years, Stuart has received a 90% payout.  Stuart, a Covered Employee, is terminated October 19, 2013.  Stuart is entitled to a bonus of $162,000 ($300,000 [Base Salary] times 60% [bonus amount] times 90% [three-year payout percentage]).

Other Benefits
 
(a)           As long as the Covered Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination has not breached any agreement referred to in Section 3.4(a) and provided the Covered Employee elects to continue group medical and/or dental coverage under the federal law known as "COBRA," Iron Mountain will continue to pay the employer share of the cost of coverage in accordance with standard payment practices until the earlier of (a) the end of the applicable Severance Period and (b) the date on which COBRA coverage ends.  A Covered Employee must continue to pay the employee share of the
 
cost of coverage during the Severance Period, and, if he or she remains COBRA-eligible, must pay for the entire remaining cost of COBRA coverage after the end of the Severance Period if he or she wishes to continue the coverage.
 
(b)           A Covered Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination is eligible for outplacement services through a provider selected by Iron Mountain for a period of nine months following termination.
 
(c)           The Severance Plan and this Program supersede and replace any prior severance pay programs, plans and arrangements (whether written or oral) for any Covered Employee except any benefit payable under a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan and except to the extent embodied in an individually negotiated agreement that provides greater benefits to the Covered Employee.
 
3.3           .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any equity compensation plan, agreement thereunder or amendment to either, if within eighteen months of the start date of a new Chief Executive Officer of Iron Mountain Incorporated who replaces C. Richard Reese a Covered Employee experiences a Qualifying Termination, all outstanding equity-based awards then held by the Covered Employee, including but not limited to all stock options, restricted stock units and performance units to the extent the applicable "Performance Period" (as defined in the performance unit) has been completed ("Earned Performance Unit"), shall be credited with an additional twelve months of vesting service as of the date of the Qualifying Termination.  If an Earned Performance Unit shall not be 100% vested after the application of the preceding sentence, additional vesting service shall be credited as necessary to fully vest the Earned Performance Unit.
Accelerated Vesting of Certain Equity Compensation
 
In the event of any acceleration of vesting under the preceding paragraph as well as upon a change in control (including a Vesting Change in Control) under any of Iron Mountain's equity compensation plans, only a total of twelve months (or such other amount as shall be necessary for an Earned Performance Unit) of accelerated vesting shall apply.
 
3.4           .
Time and Manner of Benefits
 
(a)           No Severance Benefits will be paid or provided under the Severance Plan unless the Covered Employee has signed and timely returned, and not revoked, if applicable, a "Separation and Release Agreement" and an "Employee Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement," each as defined in the Severance Plan and each in a form satisfactory to Iron Mountain.  These agreements will, among other things, provide for a release for all claims and damages that the Covered Employee may have in connection with or arising out of his or her employment or the termination of employment with Iron Mountain.
 
(b)           Severance Pay will be paid in equal installments over the Severance Period in accordance with the Covered Employee's regular payroll intervals prior to the Qualifying Termination and will be subject to applicable withholding.  Payments will commence as of the first regular payroll date following the Qualifying Termination; provided, however, that no payment will be made earlier than the sixtieth day following a
 
Qualifying Termination; and provided, further, that any applicable revocation period under a Separation and Release Agreement will have expired before any payment.  Iron Mountain may also deduct any amounts owed by the Covered Employee to the extent permitted by applicable law.
 
(c)           Severance Pay will be reduced by any other severance or termination payments due to a Covered Employee (such as a payment required pursuant to a Supplemental Unemployment Benefits Plan or WARN), any amounts owed a Covered Employee pursuant to a contract with Iron Mountain and amounts paid to a Covered Employee placed in a temporary layoff status (often referred to as a furlough).  Severance Pay will also be reduced to the extent any law provides for payments related to accrued wages, bonuses, commissions, reimbursements, vacation pay or other benefits in an amount or manner greater than Iron Mountain's policies and programs, including the Severance Plan.
 
(d)           If a Covered Employee is later rehired by Iron Mountain, he or she may keep whatever Severance Pay has been paid prior to being rehired, but will lose any right to unpaid Severance Pay.
 
(e)           It may be necessary to delay one or more of the payments otherwise due hereunder to avoid adverse income tax consequences under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  The Administrator will notify you in the event this is necessary.
 
3.5     .  The Administrator retains the right to amend this Program (and the Plan to the extent applicable to this Program) but no amendment shall diminish the rights of a Covered Employee hereunder as they may exist immediately before the effective date of the amendment without the written consent of the Covered Employee.
