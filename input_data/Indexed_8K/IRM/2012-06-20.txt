Item 8.01.             Other Events.
 
As previously reported, on March 23, 2011, the Company entered into a shareholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan") with Mellon Investor Services LLC, pursuant to which the Company, among other things,
 
issued one right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. By its terms, the Rights Plan provided that, among other things, the Rights will expire upon the close of business on the earliest to occur of (1) March 22, 2013, (2) the date on which the rights are redeemed or exchanged by the Company in accordance with the Rights Plan and (3) the date of the Annual Meeting if stockholder approval of the Rights Plan is not obtained at such meeting. In April 2012, the Board determined, after careful consideration, not to seek stockholder approval of the Rights Plan at the Annual Meeting. Consequently, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Plan, and without any further action, as of the date of the Annual Meeting, the right to exercise the Rights terminated, each Right is null and void and the Rights Plan expired.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
