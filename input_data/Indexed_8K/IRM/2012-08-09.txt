Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 6, 2012, Iron Mountain Incorporated, or the Company, entered into an amendment to the Company's existing revolving credit agreement with certain lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch, as Canadian administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, which amendment is conditioned on, among other customary conditions, the closing of the offering of the Company's 5-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, or the 5-3/4% Notes. The Company expects the amendment to become effective on August 15, 2012. The amendment will amend terms used in the Credit Agreement's consolidated leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants to accommodate the Company's payment of (i) U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities associated with a change in the Company's method of depreciating and amortizing certain assets from its current method to methods that are consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property and (ii) costs associated with the Company's plan to pursue conversion to a real estate investment trust, or REIT.
 
Item 8.01.              Other Events.
 
On August 7, 2012, the Company announced that it priced an underwritten public offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 5-3/4% Notes. The 5-3/4% Notes will be sold at 100.0% of par.  The net proceeds to the Company from this offering are expected to be approximately $984.7 million, after paying underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the redemption of all of the Company's outstanding 6-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016, or the 6-5/8% Notes, and 8-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, or the 8-3/4% Notes, including any premium associated therewith, to repay indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the costs the Company expects to incur in connection with its proposed conversion to a REIT.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
 
The redemptions of the 6-5/8% Notes and the 8-3/4% Notes will be made only by means of call notices by the trustee to holders in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the 6-5/8% Notes and the 8-3/4% Notes were issued. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute a notice of redemption of the 6-5/8% Notes or the 8-3/4% Notes.

Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the (A) Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 7(d).

In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the
 
defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties) or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleading parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties; , , if indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 7(e), then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its own counsel and that of the other indemnified parties for the QIU in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control the QIU within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of Exchange Act in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances if, in the reasonable judgment of the QIU, there may exist a conflict of interest between the QIU and the other indemnified parties.  Any such separate counsel for the QIU and such control persons of the QIU shall be designated in writing by the QIU.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or reasonably could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

Notes; , , that neither the Company nor the Guarantors will be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the QIU.

Contribution
.  In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting, in the case of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses suffered by the Company and the Guarantors any contribution received by the Company and the Guarantors from persons, other than the Underwriters, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company and the Guarantors) as incurred to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package.  The relative fault of each of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
 
fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each Underwriter and its respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, directors and officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise.  The obligations of the Underwriters to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
 
With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters, as the case may be, shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.

We have assumed, for purposes of this opinion, the genuineness of all signatures, the authority of

persons signing documents examined by us by or on behalf of parties thereto (except in the case of persons signing on behalf of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors), the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies which facts we have not independently verified and, subject to the limitations set forth below, have examined such questions of law and such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering the opinions set forth below.  We have also assumed that each Note conforms to the form thereof examined by us and the Supplemental Indenture conforms to the description thereof in the Prospectus Supplement.  We have relied, as to certain factual matters, upon representations of the Company and the Guarantors in the agreements referred to in the preceding paragraph, upon certificates or representations of officers of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors believed by us to be reasonable and upon certificates of public officials, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy and completeness of such certificates and representations.
 
We have also assumed in connection with the opinion expressed below that: (i) each of the Connecticut Guarantors is a Connecticut Statutory Trust, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, (ii) each Connecticut Guarantor has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to issue and offer the Subsidiary Guarantees and enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and the issuance of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be issued from time to time and the terms and conditions thereof and of the Indenture, and the execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantees by each Connecticut Guarantor is duly authorized and approved on behalf of such Connecticut Guarantor (such approvals referred to herein as the "") and (iii) the Proceedings, the issuance of the Subsidiary Guarantees and the terms and conditions of the Indenture will be (A) in accordance with applicable laws and the governing documents of each of the Connecticut Guarantors and (B) not in conflict with any contractual or other restrictions which are binding on any such Connecticut Guarantor.
Proceedings
 
We have assumed for purposes of this opinion that the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by, the Indenture.  We have also assumed that the Trustee has all requisite organizational and legal power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, that the Trustee is in compliance, generally with respect to acting as a trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations, that the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture, and that the Indenture will be the valid and binding agreement of the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms.
 
This opinion is limited solely to the laws of the State of New York, as applied by courts located in the State of New York, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applied by courts located in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal laws of the United States of America, to the extent that the same may apply to or govern such transactions, and the corporate and limited liability company laws of the State of Delaware to the extent indicated in this paragraph. Although we are not admitted to practice before the Bar of the State of Delaware, we are generally familiar with the laws of the State of Delaware pertaining to corporate and limited liability company matters, and, to the extent that conclusions based on the laws of the State of Delaware are involved in the opinions set forth herein, we have relied in part, in rendering such opinions, upon our examination of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Limited Liability
 
Company Act as currently in effect, including the statutory provisions and reported judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing, and on our knowledge of interpretations of analogous laws of the State of New York. We express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws. Insofar as this opinion involves matters of Connecticut law with respect to the Connecticut Guarantors we have, with your permission, relied solely on the opinion of Gesmer Updegrove LLP dated August 7, 2012, a copy of which we understand you are filing herewith as Exhibit 5.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company of even date herewith (the ""), and our opinion is subject to the exceptions, qualifications and limitations therein expressed.  The opinions expressed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, insofar as they relate to the good standing of the Company and the Delaware Guarantors under the laws of the State of Delaware are based solely on certificates from appropriate state authorities to such effect.
8-K
 
Our opinion set forth below with respect to the validity or binding effect of the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees or any other obligations may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, marshaling, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement generally of the rights and remedies of creditors and secured parties or the obligations of debtors, and (ii) general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including but not limited to principles limiting the availability of specific performance or injunctive relief, and concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof:
 
1.
                                      
The Company and each of the Delaware Guarantors is a corporation or limited liability company, as the case may be, duly formed and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware and is in good standing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; and
 
2.
                                      
The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Company and the Delaware Guarantors, respectively and, when (i) the Indenture shall have been duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto and (ii) the Notes have been (A) duly executed and delivered by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, and (B) duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor, as provided in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Indenture, will constitute validly issued and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms.
 
The opinions set forth herein are rendered as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update such opinions to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in the law which may hereafter occur.  This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the offering of the Notes under the Prospectus.  This opinion may not be relied upon for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without our prior written consent, except that (A) this opinion may be furnished or quoted to judicial or regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over you, and (B) this opinion may be relied upon by purchasers and holders of the Notes currently entitled to rely on it pursuant to applicable provisions of federal securities law.  We hereby consent to the filing of a copy of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company, which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to references to our firm
 
under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Base Prospectus and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.

In our capacity as the Connecticut Guarantors' special counsel we have reviewed the documents listed in , attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The documents listed in , inclusive, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "."
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
Documents
 
This opinion is based entirely on our review of the Documents.  We have made no other documentary review or investigation of any kind whatsoever for purposes of this opinion.
 
For purposes of this opinion we have assumed the genuineness of all other signatures,
 
 
(other than on behalf of the Connecticut Guarantors) the genuiness of all documents reviewed by us that are presented to us as either originals or copies, the authenticity and completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original or copy form and the legal competence of each individual executing any document.  We have also assumed that each Note conforms to the form thereof as examined by us, and the Second Supplemental Indenture conforms to the description thereof in the Prospectus Supplement (defined below).  We have relied, as to certain factual matters, upon representations of the Connecticut Guarantors in the Documents, upon certificates or representations of the owner trustees of the 98 Trust, 99 Trust and 2001 Trust, respectively, and upon certificates of public officials, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy and completeness of such certificates and representations.
 
We have assumed for purposes of this opinion that the Company and Trustee are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, and are duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture.  We have also assumed that the Company and Trustee have all requisite organizational and legal power and authority to execute, deliver and perform their obligations under the Indenture, and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, that the Company and Trustee are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, that the Company and Trustee have duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture, and that the Indenture is and will be the valid and binding agreement of the Company and Trustee, enforceable against each in accordance with its terms.
 
We assume the Company knows and understands that we represent the Connecticut Guarantors only, that we do not represent the Company, and although we have represented the Connecticut Guarantors from time to time in connection with various matters, we do not act as general counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors.  Further, we are not necessarily familiar with the day-to-day operations of any of the Connecticut Guarantors.  There may be other matters that are handled by other counsel to the Connecticut Guarantors, with respect to which we have not been consulted and of which we have no knowledge.
 
This opinion is limited solely to the laws of the State of Connecticut, as applied by courts located in the State of Connecticut.  To the extent that the foregoing laws may apply to or govern the transactions described above, we express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws.  The opinions expressed below, insofar as they relate to the good standing of the Connecticut Guarantors under the laws of the State of Connecticut, are based solely on certificates from the Connecticut Secretary of State.  For purposes of the opinions set forth herein, we have assumed, with the Company's permission, that the laws of the State of Connecticut will apply to all transactions, agreements and matters set forth herein.
 
In rendering this opinion we assume that the execution of all documents on behalf of all entities and persons other than the Connecticut Guarantors was duly authorized and that such documents were validly executed and delivered on behalf of such entities and persons.
 
Our opinion is further subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and assumptions:
 
(a)
                                
We express no opinion on the enforceability of the Indenture, as it relates to any party other than the Connecticut Guarantors;
 
(b)
                                
The transactions described in the Indenture, Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated June 28, 2010 relating to the Registration Statement (the "") and the final prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus dated August 7, 2012 (the "", and together with the Base Prospectus collectively the "") may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, marshaling or other laws and rules of law affecting the enforcement generally of creditors' rights and remedies (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers of debtors' or guarantors' rights); and we express no opinion as to the status under any fraudulent conveyance laws or fraudulent transfer laws of any of the obligations of, or any security interest granted by the Connecticut Guarantors, or any other person, whether under the Indenture or otherwise;
Base Prospectus
Prospectus Supplement
Prospectus
 
(c)
                                 
The transaction described in the Indenture, Registration Statement and Prospectus may be subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and will be subject to a duty to act in a commercially reasonable manner. We have assumed that, in connection with any proceeding all parties will act in good faith, with diligence and in compliance with statutory requirements;
 
(d)
                                
We express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring, circumstances arising, or changes of law becoming effective or occurring, after the date hereof on the matters addressed in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to inform the Company of additional or changed facts, or changes in law, of which we may become aware;
 
(e)
                                 
We express no opinion with respect to any matter involving financial information or relating to compliance with financial covenants or financial requirements; and

The opinions set forth below do not apply to the extent that judicial decisions may permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify the terms or the interpretation of any of the documents or agreements identified herein, or to the extent that judicial decisions may make certain provisions of agreements unenforceable where their enforcement would violate the implied covenant of fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable, or where their breach is not material.
 
Based on the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed necessary, and subject to the qualifications and exceptions herein contained, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.
             
Each of the Connecticut Guarantors is a Connecticut statutory trust, and duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut.
2.
             
Upon execution and delivery of the Second Supplemental Indenture and the guaranties executed by the Connecticut Guarantors (collectively the ""), such Guaranties shall have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of them.
Guaranties
 
3.
             
Upon execution and delivery of the Guaranties, such Guaranties shall constitute validly issued and binding obligations of the Connecticut Guarantors, enforceable against the respective Connecticut Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinions above relate only to laws and regulations, and consents, approvals, actions and filings required thereunder, which in our experience, are normally applicable to companies in the type of business engaged in by the Connecticut Guarantors.  Moreover, we express no opinion as to any consent, approval, action or filing, or violation of law, (i) which may be required as a result of the Company's involvement in the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement or Prospectus because of the Company's legal or regulatory status or because of any other facts specifically pertaining to the Company; or (ii) which, under Connecticut's blue-sky laws, could be readily obtained without significant delay or expense to the Company, without loss to the Company of any material benefit under the Indenture or Prospectus and without any material adverse effect on the Company or the Connecticut Guarantors during the period such consent, approval, action or filing was not obtained or effected.
 
We render or imply no opinion with respect to compliance with any federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, including without limitation, those relating to registration, filing, anti-fraud, or which relate to the accuracy or completeness of disclosure.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of Connecticut and we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of Connecticut.
 
We are not opining on specialized laws relating to tax, insolvency, antitrust, pension, employee benefit, environmental, intellectual property, banking, insurance, labor, health and safety and securities laws.  We are also not opining on federal law or the law of any county, municipality or other political subdivision or local governmental agency or authority.
 
We undertake no obligation to advise the Company of facts or changes in law occurring after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
 
We are furnishing this opinion letter to the Company solely in connection with the transactions under the Indenture and Prospectus.  The Company may not rely on this opinion letter in any other connection.  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company of even date herewith, which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to references to this firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Base Prospectus and "Legal Matters" in the
