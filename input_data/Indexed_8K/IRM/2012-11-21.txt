Item 8.01.             Other Events.
 
Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Company") issued today 17.04 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and paid an aggregate of approximately $140.0 million in connection with the payment of the Company's previously announced special dividend of $700 million, or approximately $4.06 per share (the "Special Dividend"). The Special Dividend represents a significant part of the distribution that would eventually be required should the Company successfully convert to a real estate investment trust.
 
The Special Dividend is payable today to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 22, 2012. Stockholders who elected to receive payment of the Special Dividend in cash will receive approximately $1.14 per share of their payment, or 28%, in cash and approximately $2.92 per share, or 72%, in shares of Common Stock. All other stockholders will receive 100% of their payment in shares of Common Stock. Stockholders will also receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any. The number of shares to be issued was determined based upon the average closing price on the three trading days following November 14, 2012, or $32.87 per share.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: November 21, 2012
