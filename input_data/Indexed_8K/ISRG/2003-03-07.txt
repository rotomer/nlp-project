NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1. THE MERGER Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). Section 1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or if another date and time is specified in such filing, such specified date and time, being the "Effective Time"). Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of Merger Sub, each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the same may be amended in accordance with Section 5.13.1 hereof. Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to 2
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. ARTICLE 2. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: Section 2.1.1 Conversion Generally. Section 2.1.1.1 Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2), including the associated rights of the Company (the "Company Rights") pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 14, 1999, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Company Rights Agreement") shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2.5, into the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio. All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Company Common Stock was converted in the Merger. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without interest. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2.5 hereof. Section 2.1.1.2 Company Preferred Stock. Each share of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Preferred Stock" and, together 3
with the Company Common Stock, the "Company Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2.5, into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to that number of shares of Company Common Stock into which the Company Preferred Stock would have been convertible multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. All such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Company Preferred Stock was converted in the Merger. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without interest. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2.5 hereof. Section 2.1.1.3 Warrants. At the Effective Time, all unexercised and unexpired warrants to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Warrants") then outstanding will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in such Company Warrant and any agreements executed in connection therewith immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant assumed, will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Section 2.1.2 Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share of Company Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the 4
treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Section 2.1.3 Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Section 2.1.4 Change in Shares. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. Section 2.2.1 Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computer Share, Inc. or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.2.5 hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Section 2.2.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery 5
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into account all shares of Company Stock then held by such holder), cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3. Section 2.2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2.5, unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall 6
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Section 2.2.4 Further Rights in Company Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2.3 or Section 2.2.5) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. Section 2.2.5 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. Section 2.2.5.1 As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the difference between (A) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2.1 and (B) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.2.2 (such difference being the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on Nasdaq, all in the manner provided in this Section 2.2.5. Section 2.2.5.2 The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to such holders of 7
Company Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders of Company Stock as part of the Exchange Fund. The Company shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares. In addition, the Company shall pay the Exchange Agent's compensation and expenses in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Company Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Stock are entitled. Section 2.2.5.3 As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders of Company Stock subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2.3. Section 2.2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without any interest thereon. Section 2.2.7 No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Section 2.2.8 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of 8
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without any interest thereon. Section 2.2.9 Withholding. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Section 2.3 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3. Section 2.4 Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Options") then outstanding, under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Company's Tandem Stock Option Plan, the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. 9
Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option assumed, will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The conversion of any Company Options which are incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company Options within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. Continuous employment with the Company or its subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of all assumed Company Options after the Effective Time. ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which identifies exceptions by specific Section references, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 4.11.1 Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers' compensation, occupational safety, plant closings, and wages and hours.

Except as set forth in Section 4.11.1 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and no collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being negotiated by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. There is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened which may interfere in any respect that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect with the respective business activities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. No labor union or similar organization has otherwise been certified to represent any persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or has applied to represent such employees or, to the knowledge of Parent, is attempting to organize so as to represent such employees. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or their respective representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practices in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and there is no charge or complaint against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state or foreign agency pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such unfair labor practice, charge or complaint would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed for it or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees. Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has withheld all amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, and is not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

To Parent's knowledge, no employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is in any material respect in violation of any term of any employment contract, non-disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Parent or such Parent Subsidiary because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others. No employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has given notice, nor is Parent otherwise aware, that such employee intends to terminate his or her employment with Parent or such Parent Subsidiary.

affiliate from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or affiliate under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise, (B) significantly increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material benefits. No individual who is a party to an employment agreement listed in Section 4.11.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or any agreement incorporating change in control provisions with Parent has terminated employment or been terminated, nor has any event occurred that could give rise to a termination event, in either case under circumstances that has given, or could give, rise to a severance obligation on the part of Parent under such agreement. Section 4.11.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth Parent's best estimates of the amounts payable to the executives listed therein, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, and/or any subsequent employment termination (including any cash-out or acceleration of options and restricted stock and any "gross-up" payments with respect to any of the foregoing), based on compensation data applicable as of the date of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the assumptions stated therein. Section 4.11.3 There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted against any Parent Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to the PBGC, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan.

In addition, the matters disclosed on Section 4.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.12 Employee Benefit Matters. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Company Employees") will participate effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall 67
cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility for participation in, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, in any such Parent Benefit Plan; provided, however, that with regard to vacation, on and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, each Company Employee with credit for service under the Parent vacation policy pursuant to the terms of such policy as may be amended from time to time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer or director of the Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder ("Section 16") of shares of Parent Common Stock or options to acquire Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. Section 5.13 Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Section 5.13.1 Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that the indemnification obligations set forth in the Company Certificate and Company By-laws shall survive the Merger (and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Merger Sub to reflect such provisions) and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who served at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, unless such amendment or modification is required by Law. Section 5.13.2 For six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Company's existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent 68
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to be approximately $315,000. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 5.13, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The obligations under this Section 5.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.13 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.13 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.13). Section 5.13.3 In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (A) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13. Section 5.14 Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or supplemented pursuant to this Section 5.15 to execute a written agreement, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, as to such person's prospective compliance with the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act on transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by such person in the Merger.

Before seeking the stay in Delaware, counsel for Parent shall exercise all reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to stay all further proceedings in Delaware. As part of the requested stays, the parties shall request that the courts cease all further activity in the cases during the period of stay, including refraining from issuing any further opinions or orders on issues already previously submitted for decision.

an extension of the stays would be justified or desirable, then patent litigation counsel shall cooperate to request appropriate extensions of the stays in each forum. Section 5.17.2 Upon execution of this Agreement, patent prosecution counsel for both parties shall immediately confer in good faith for the purpose of seeking to stay opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, and will file papers as soon as practicable jointly requesting either that the opposition proceeding No. IK/I-12053, be stayed through and including August 31, 2003 or until further notice (if possible) or that any impending filing deadlines be extended by at least six months. Section 5.17.3 Within three days after consummation of the Merger, (i) patent litigation counsel for both parties shall cooperate in good faith to jointly file papers in all of the stayed litigations requesting dismissal with prejudice of all claims, counterclaims and cross-claims (if any), and before seeking such dismissal in Delaware, counsel for Parent shall exercise all reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to such dismissal; (ii) patent prosecution counsel for both parties shall seek dismissal with prejudice (or similar terminating relief) of all opposition proceedings; and (iii) in accordance with 35 U.S.C.

Section 5.17.4 Subject to Section 5.17.5, if for any reason this Agreement is terminated by either party prior to consummation of the Merger, then, upon five days' written notice by the party seeking to lift the stays, that party may unilaterally request that the stays in each of the litigations be immediately lifted and may also immediately request a status conference. Section 5.17.5 As part of the stay requested in C.D. Cal. Case Nos. CV 00-4988-CBM pursuant to Section 5.17.1, the parties shall jointly request that the court reserve the earliest available trial date no earlier than November 30, 2003; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1.4, 7.1.5, 7.1.6 or 7.1.7, the Company agrees and hereby stipulates that it will not thereafter request, suggest or justify a trial date any earlier than February 29, 2004, and hereby agrees to take all necessary and reasonable steps to seek from the court an additional three-month extension of the trial date under these circumstances. 71
Section 5.17.6 Within one day of the execution of this Agreement or as soon thereafter as practicable, patent litigation counsel for both parties shall jointly stipulate and request that the Company be immediately relieved from the Delaware court's requirement that it post a bond as security for the damage award due Parent, without prejudice to possible future reinstatement; provided, however, that as part of that stipulation, the Company shall also stipulate to an immediate reimposition of the previous bond requirement should the stay in Delaware be lifted prior to consummation of the Merger upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, without any further obligation or requirement of Parent to act. Parent's counsel shall promptly exercise all reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to effectuate this relief, if such consent is deemed necessary or desirable to do so. Section 5.18 Board of Directors. Parent agrees to increase the size of the Parent Board and shall have validly elected directors such that immediately following the Effective Time, the Parent Board shall consist of nine directors, including Robert Duggan and one other individual to be proposed by the Company as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement and satisfactory to Parent. Section 5.19 Termination of 401(k) Plan.

as it deems necessary or proper for the care or protection thereof, including the right to remove all or any portion of the Collateral, and with or without taking such possession may sell or cause to be sold, whenever the Lender shall decide, in one or more sales or parcels, at such prices as the Lender may deem appropriate, and for cash or on credit or for future delivery, without assumption of any credit risk, all or any portion of the Collateral, at any broker's board or at public or private sale, without demand of performance but within 10 days' written notice to the Borrower of the time and place of any such public sale or sales (which notice the Borrower hereby agrees is reasonable) and with such other notices as may be required by applicable law and cannot be waived, and the Lender shall have no liability should the proceeds resulting from a private sale be less than the proceeds realizable from a public sale, and the Lender or any other Person may be the purchaser of all or any portion of the Collateral so sold and thereafter hold the same absolutely, free (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) from any claim or right of whatever kind, including any equity of redemption, of the Borrower, any such demand, notice, claim, right or equity being hereby expressly waived and released by the Borrower. At any sale or sales made pursuant to this Section 8, the Lender may bid for or purchase, free (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) from any claim or right of whatever kind, including any equity of redemption, without demand therefore or notice to the Borrower, any such demand, notice, claim, right or equity being hereby expressly waived and released, any part of or all of the Collateral offered for sale, and may make any payment on account thereof by using any claim for moneys then due and payable to the Lender by the Borrower hereunder as a credit against the purchase price. The Lender shall in any such sale make no representations or warranties with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof, and the Lender shall not be chargeable with any of the obligations or liabilities of the Borrower. The Borrower hereby agrees (i) that it will indemnify and hold the Lender harmless from and against any and all claims with respect to the Collateral asserted before the taking of actual possession or control of the relevant Collateral by the Lender pursuant to this Section 8, or arising out of any act of, or omission to act on the part of, any Person prior to such taking of actual possession or control by the Lender (whether asserted before or after such taking of possession or control), or arising out of any act on the part of the Borrower or its Affiliates or agents before or after the commencement of such actual possession or control by the Lender, but excluding therefrom all claims with respect to the Collateral resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender; and (ii) the Lender shall not have liability or obligation to the Borrower arising out of any such claim except for acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender. Subject only to the lawful rights of third parties, any Person that has possession of any of the Collateral is hereby constituted and appointed by the Borrower as pledgeholder for the Lender and, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each such pledgeholder is hereby authorized (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) to sell all or any portion of the Collateral upon the order and direction of the Lender, and the Borrower hereby waives any and all claims, for damages or otherwise, for any action taken by such pledgeholder in accordance with the terms of the UCC not otherwise waived hereunder. In any action hereunder, the Lender shall be entitled, if permitted by applicable law, to the appointment of a receiver without notice, to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and to exercise such powers as the court shall confer upon the receiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation of such Event of Default, the Lender shall be entitled to apply, without prior notice to the Borrower, any cash or cash items constituting Collateral in the possession of the Lender to payment of the Secured Obligations. 23
8.6 Application of Proceeds on Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the balances in any account of the Borrower which constitutes part of the Collateral, all other income on the Collateral, and all proceeds from any sale of the Collateral pursuant hereto shall be applied first toward payment of the costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Lender in enforcing this Agreement, in realizing on or protecting any Collateral and in enforcing or collecting any Secured Obligations, including, without limitation, court costs and the attorney's fees and expenses incurred by the Lender, then to satisfy or provide cash Collateral for all obligations relating to Secured Obligations, and then the indefeasible payment in full of the Secured Obligations in accordance with this Agreement. Any amounts remaining after such indefeasible payment in full shall be remitted to the Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 8.7 Power of Attorney. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default which is not waived in writing by the Lender, (a) the Borrower does hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint the Lender or any of its officers or designees the Borrower's true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power in the name of the Lender or such other Person to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to the Borrower, and to endorse any notes, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral that may come into the possession of the Lender with full power and right to cause the mail of such Persons to be transferred to the Lender's own offices or otherwise, and to do any and all other acts necessary or proper to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the grant of the security interests hereunder and under the Loan Documents, and the Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Lender or its substitutes shall properly do by virtue hereof; (b) the Borrower does hereby further irrevocably make, constitute and appoint the Lender or any of its officers or designees its true and lawful attorney-in-fact in the name of the Lender or the Borrower (i) to enforce all of the Borrower's rights under and pursuant to all agreements with respect to the Collateral, all for the sole benefit of the Lender and to enter into such other agreements (as may be lawful and without breach of contract) as may be necessary, desirable or appropriate in the judgment of the Lender to complete the production, distribution or exploitation of any Collateral, (ii) to enter into and perform such agreements as may be necessary, desirable or appropriate in the judgment of the Lender in order to carry out the terms, covenants and conditions of the Loan Documents that are required to be observed or performed by the Borrower, (iii) to execute such other and further mortgages, pledges and assignments of the Collateral, and related instruments or agreements, as the Lender may reasonably require for the purpose of perfecting, protecting, maintaining or enforcing the security interests granted to the Lender hereunder, and under the other Loan Documents, and (iv) to do any and all other things necessary, desirable or appropriate in the judgment of the Lender to carry out the intention of this Agreement and the grant of the security interests hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. The Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms in advance all that the Lender as such attorney-in-fact or its substitutes shall properly do by virtue of this power of attorney. 8.8 Termination and Release. The security interests granted under this Agreement shall terminate when all the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and performed and the commitments pursuant to this Agreement shall have terminated. Upon request by the Borrower (and at the sole expense of the Borrower) after such termination, the Lender will take all reasonable action and do all things reasonably necessary, including executing UCC 24
termination statements, termination letters to account debtors and copyright and trademark releases, to terminate the security interest granted to it hereunder. 8.9 Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies conferred upon or reserved to the Lender in this Section 8 are intended to be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy or remedies available to the Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender shall have all rights and remedies of a secured creditor under Article 9 of the UCC and other applicable law. SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS 9.1 [intentionally deleted] 9.2 Indemnification. The Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Lender and each of its successors, assigns, heirs, Subsidiaries, Affiliates and all of the officers, directors, employees, partners, members, representatives, advisors and agents (including, without limitation, attorneys and accountants) of each of the aforementioned Persons, and each of them, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses, demands, causes of action, suits, debts, obligations, rights, promises, acts, agreements and damages of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, heretofore or hereafter arising out of, relating to, connected with or incidental to the failure of any representation or warranty made by the Borrower in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or in any other documents or agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or the failure of the Borrower to comply with the covenants, agreements or other obligations contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (but excluding (i) any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses, demands, causes of action, suits, debts, obligations, rights, promises, acts, agreements and damages of the Lender to the extent incurred solely by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender or (ii) litigation solely between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lender, on the other hand, in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby if, after final non-appealable judgment, the Lender is not the prevailing party in such litigation). The agreements in this Section 9.2 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. 9.3 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire agreement between the Lender and the Borrower pertaining to the subject matter contained herein and therein. Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof, may be amended, supplemented or modified, nor may the obligations of the parties hereto or thereto be waived, except pursuant to a writing signed by both the Lender and the Borrower. 9.4 Waivers. The Lender shall not be deemed, by any act or omission, to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Lender and then only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. A waiver with reference to one event shall not be construed as continuing or as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy as to a subsequent event. No delay or omission of the Lender to exercise any right, whether before or 25
after a default hereunder, shall impair any such right or shall be construed to be a waiver of any right or default, and the acceptance at any time by the Lender of any past-due amount shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to require prompt payment when due of any other amounts then or thereafter due and payable. 9.5 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by telecopy), and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when delivered by hand, or three days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, or, in the case of a telecopy notice, when received (provided an original copy of such notice is mailed, postage pre-paid within the next business day after such notice is sent by telecopy), or, in the case of delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier, when received, addressed as follows, or to such other address as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto: The Borrower: Computer Motion, Inc. 130-B Cremona Drive Santa Barbara, California 93117 Attn: Robert W.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lender and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 9.7 Interest Deficit. If the provisions of this Agreement or the Note would at any time require payment by the Borrower to the Lender of any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount then permitted by applicable law, the interest payments to the Lender shall be 26
reduced but only to the extent necessary so that the Lender shall not receive interest in excess of such maximum amount. If, as a result of the foregoing, the Lender shall receive interest payments under the Note in an amount less than the amount otherwise provided hereunder, such deficit (hereinafter called the "Interest Deficit") will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, cumulate and will be carried forward (without interest) until the payment in full of the Note or such earlier time as it may be paid. Interest otherwise payable to the Lender for any subsequent period shall be increased by the maximum amount of the Interest Deficit that may be so added without causing the Lender to receive interest in excess of the maximum amount then permitted by the law applicable thereto. The amount of any Interest Deficit shall be treated as a prepayment penalty and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be paid in full at the time of any prepayment by the Borrower to the Lender. The amount of any Interest Deficit at the time of any complete payment of the Loan (if any) (other than an optional prepayment thereof) shall, except to the full extent then permitted to be paid under applicable law, be canceled and not paid. 9.8 Confidentiality. In handling any confidential information of the Borrower, the Lender shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises with respect to its own proprietary information of the same types to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information thereby received or received pursuant to this Agreement, except that disclosure of such information may be made (i) to the Subsidiaries or Affiliates of the Lender in connection with their present or prospective business relations with the Borrower, (ii) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Loan, provided that they have entered into a comparable confidentiality agreement in favor of the Borrower and have delivered a copy to the Borrower, (iii) under any Requirement of Law, (iv) as may be required in connection with the examination, audit or similar investigation of the Lender, (v) in connection with the Merger Agreement and (vi) as the Lender may deem appropriate in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder. Confidential information hereunder shall not include information that either (a) is in the public domain or in the knowledge or possession of the Lender when disclosed to the Lender by the Borrower, or becomes part of the public domain after disclosure to the Lender through no fault of the Lender; or (b) is disclosed to the Lender by a third party, provided the Lender does not have actual knowledge that such third party is prohibited from disclosing such information. 9.9 Payment of Expenses. Without duplication of amounts payable under Section 7.2.2 of the Merger Agreement, the Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse the Lender upon the termination of the Merger Agreement for all of the Lender's out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with its due diligence with respect to the Loan, the preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the enforcement of its rights hereunder or thereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Lender's outside counsel; provided that notwithstanding Section 7.2.2. of the Merger Agreement, the Borrower agrees to reimburse the Lender for all such costs and expenses (including without limitation the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Lender's outside counsel) incurred by the Lender in connection with the Loan Documents following termination of the Merger Agreement, including without limitation in connection with the enforcement of the Lender's rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. 27

In case any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall, to the extent possible, be modified in such manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable but so as to most nearly retain the intent of the parties, and if such modification is not possible, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and in either case the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the future application of such provision shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE.

(the "Lender"), the aggregate principal amount of Seven Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,300,000), or the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans made by the Lender to Borrower pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement (as defined below), whichever is less (the "Principal Amount"), together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Amount, on Maturity Date, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender therein for the payment of public and private debts. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in that certain Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 7, 2003, between Borrower and the Lender (as amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). This Note shall accrue interest at a fixed rate per annum of eight percent (8%) (the "Interest Rate") with respect to the outstanding unpaid Principal Amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and on any other Secured Obligations compounding annually (the "Interest") until and including the date the Principal Amount, such interest and the other Secured Obligations are paid in full. Such Interest shall, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, be due and payable, together with all outstanding Principal Amount, on the Maturity Date (or such earlier date as required under the Loan Agreement), in each case with interest to accrue and be due and payable through and including the applicable payment date. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, provided, however, that per diem interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 days. The Secured Obligations under this Note are secured by the Collateral of Borrower pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1 INTUITIVE SURGICAL AND COMPUTER MOTION ANNOUNCE MERGER AGREEMENT SUNNYVALE, CALIF., MARCH 7, 2003 - Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) and Computer Motion (NASDAQ: RBOT) today announced they are merging into one company that combines their strengths in operative surgical robotics, telesurgery, and operating room integration, to better serve hospitals, doctors and patients. Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Computer Motion's equity holders would receive 32 percent of the combined company on a fully diluted basis (including out-of-the-money options and warrants), and Intuitive's equity holders would receive 68 percent. The merger agreement exchange ratio formula anticipates that each outstanding share of Computer Motion common stock would be converted into approximately 0.52 shares of Intuitive common stock. In the event that Computer Motion's common stock trades at an average of less than $1.86 per share before the merger, the exchange ratio will be reduced, but shall in no event be less than approximately 0.48. (See attached table). Under the merger agreement, it is anticipated that Intuitive will issue an aggregate of approximately 15.39 million shares, on a net fully diluted basis, in exchange for all of Computer Motion's outstanding common stock, preferred stock, options and warrants. The merger is subject to the approval of a majority of the shareholders of each company and is intended to be a tax-free reorganization. In addition, Intuitive may provide a bridge loan to Computer Motion to provide working capital for its operations through the closure period if necessary. "Both of our companies have made tremendous contributions to medicine by delivering less-invasive surgery with surgical robotics," said Intuitive Surgical President
and CEO Lonnie Smith. "By combining our highly complementary technology and talents, we believe we will be able to provide surgeons and hospitals with the best possible products and support to serve their patients' needs in minimally invasive surgery. We believe both the da Vinci(TM) and ZEUS(R) surgical system platforms will play an important and complementary role in the future of our new company with each delivering unique benefits to our customers." "Surgical robotics has delivered on its promise of making surgery less invasive, shortening recovery times and lessening the trauma for patients, while providing economic value for our hospital customers," said Robert Duggan, Chairman and CEO of Computer Motion. "Separately, our companies wouldn't be able to accomplish for patients and our shareholders what we will be able to accomplish together. By sharing our complementary technologies in networking, articulation, control and visualization, we believe we will significantly strengthen the surgical capabilities of both the da Vinci and ZEUS product platforms. We look forward to working as one team to enhance the care received by patients through less-invasive surgery." The merger will also end a series of long-term patent disputes. "With these disputes behind us, we can focus the talent and energy of the combined organization on developing and growing the application of robotics to minimally invasive surgery; the significant benefits we bring to patients, surgeons, and medical centers throughout the world; and the operating efficiencies that the combination will deliver to the bottom line," Mr. Smith concluded. "This is an important merger for Computer Motion. Eliminating intellectual property litigation and initiating technology sharing should have a positive impact on
market value. In addition, this merger strengthens our organization's financial and operational capabilities," Mr. Duggan added. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System is used by surgeons in more than 100 hospitals around the world and provides all the advantages of open surgery while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through small ports of minimally invasive surgery. Intuitive shipped 60 da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2002 and had total sales of $72 million. Computer Motion is a high-tech medical device company evolving surgical practices to enhance patient lives. Computer Motion plays a significant role in transitioning the surgical community from current open procedures to endoscopic procedures that are less painful and traumatic to the patient. Computer Motion's products include the ZEUS(R) MicroWrist(TM) Robotic Surgical System for minimally invasive surgical procedures, and the HERMES(R) Control Center, a centralized system that enables the surgeon to voice control a network of "smart" medical devices. The AESOP(R) Robotic Endoscope Positioner is the first surgical robot to be made commercially available in the U.S. The company's newest product, the SOCRATES(TM) Telecollaboration System, facilitates surgeon collaboration using video and audio conferencing, shared control of the endoscopic camera, and video annotation on the surgical image in the operating room. The merged company will be traded on NASDAQ under a symbol to be determined. Mr. Smith will serve as President and CEO and Mr. Duggan will serve as member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Darrin Uecker will join the new executive team as Vice President and Chief Technical Officer and will report to Dr. Gary Guthart, Senior
Vice President of Operations. The company will be headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., with operations in both Sunnyvale and Goleta, Calif. Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion will host a joint conference call to discuss this merger today at 10:00 AM PST. The dial-in numbers for this call are 877-909-3508 for U.S. calls and 484-630-4228 for International calls. The passcode is ISRG and the leader is Lonnie Smith. About Intuitive Surgical The DA VINCI(TM) Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance INSITE(TM) 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating ENDOWRIST(TM) Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its System enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The DA VINCI Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.

In the event that less than all of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are redeemed, the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder its stock certificate representing the balance of such shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock not redeemed.

SECTION 4. CONVERSION. (a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 3 and this Section 4, a Holder has the right to convert shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, into such number of shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") equal to the aggregate Stated Value of the shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock divided by the then effective Conversion Price (as defined below) and any accrued and unpaid dividends shall then be payable in accordance with Section 2 above. (b) Automatic Conversion. At any time following 180 days after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall 3
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock equal to the Stated Value divided by the then effective Conversion Price on the sixth (6th) Trading Day following the date that the Corporation provides written notice to each Holder that immediately following any ten (10) consecutive Trading Days during which the VWAP is greater than $3.00 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"); provided, however, that the Registration Statement remains effective on the sixth (6th) Trading Day referred to above. In the event of an automatic conversion as described above, any accrued and unpaid dividends shall be due and payable on the date of such automatic conversion in accordance with Section 2 above. (c) Conversion Price; Amount. The price at which the Holder may convert shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) into shares of Common Stock shall be $1.38, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(f) (the "Conversion Price"). In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. (d) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) To convert shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 4(a), the Holder must (i) complete and sign a Notice of Conversion in form acceptable to the Corporation (the "Notice of Conversion") and deliver the Notice of Conversion to the Corporation as herein provided and (ii) prior to the date on which delivery of Common Stock is required to be made hereunder, (x) duly endorse and deliver to the Corporation the Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) representing the shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock being converted and (y) pay any transfer or similar tax with respect to the delivery of such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) if required. The Holder shall surrender such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) and the Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (with an advance copy by facsimile of the Notice of Conversion). The date on which Notice of Conversion is given (the "Date of Conversion") shall be deemed to be the date of receipt by the Corporation of the facsimile of the Notice of Conversion, provided that such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) are received by the Corporation within five (5) business days thereafter. The Corporation shall not be obligated to cause the transfer agent for the Common Stock (the "Transfer Agent") to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless either such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate has been received by the Corporation or, if such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Holder has executed and delivered to the Corporation an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with the shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s). If the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer ("FAST") program, the Holder shall deliver to the Corporation valid broker information, including DTC number, and verification that such broker has been instructed to initiate the DWAC transfer (as defined below) (collectively, the "Broker Information") and, thereafter, the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent to transmit electronically the shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder upon conversion of shares of 4
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock by crediting the account of the Holder's prime broker with DTC through DTC's Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ("DWAC") system, within three (3) business days after delivery to the Corporation of the Broker Information and the Holder's Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s). In the event the Holder otherwise elects in writing, however, the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent to issue and deliver (within such three (3) business day period) to the address of the Holder on the books of the Corporation or as otherwise directed pursuant to the Notice of Conversion, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. In the event the Corporation fails to complete such delivery as aforesaid, it shall be responsible for actual damages incurred by the Holder as a result thereof. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. Notwithstanding that the Holder is required to deliver the Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s), duly endorsed, within five (5) business days after the Date of Conversion, if such Series D Convertible Certificate(s) are not received by the Corporation within ten (10) business days after the Date of Conversion, the Corporation may at its option elect, by written notice given to the Holder within fifteen (15) business days after the Date of Conversion, elect (A) to treat Notice of Conversion as null and void or (B) to treat the Notice of Conversion as binding and require the Holder to deliver the applicable Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s). In the event the Corporation elects to treat the Notice of Conversion as binding, the shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to which such Notice of Conversion was given shall thereafter no longer be deemed outstanding and the Holder thereof shall not be entitled to any voting or other rights attendant thereto, excepting only the right to receive, upon the delivery to the Corporation of the applicable Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s), the shares of Common Stock upon the conversion thereof as contemplated above. Following conversion of a share of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, such share will no longer be outstanding and may not be reissued. In the event of the conversion of less than all of the shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock represented by a Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, the Corporation or its Transfer Agent will issue to the Holder a new stock certificate representing the number of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock not converted or shall endorse the Series D Convertible Stock Certificate to reflect such conversion. If, within three (3) business days of the Corporation's receipt of the Conversion Notice and the Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) to be converted, the Corporation shall fail to issue and deliver to a Holder the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock or to issue a new Series D Convertible Stock Certificate representing the number of shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), in addition to all other available remedies which such Holder may pursue hereunder and under the Purchase Agreement, the Corporation shall pay additional damages to such Holder on each business day after such third (3rd) business day that such conversion is not timely effected in an amount equal to 0.5% of the product of (A) the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock not issued to the Holder on a timely basis pursuant to this Section 4(b)(i) and to which such Holder is entitled, and, in the event the Corporation has failed to deliver a Series D Convertible Stock Certificate to the Holder on a timely basis pursuant to this Section 4(b)(i), the number of 5
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, as of the last possible date which the Corporation could have issued such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate to such Holder without violating Section 4(b)(i) and (B) the VWAP of the Common Stock on the last possible date which the Corporation could have issued such Common Stock and such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, as the case may be, to such Holder without violating this Section 4(b)(i). If the Corporation fails to pay the additional damages set forth in this Section 4(b)(i) within five (5) business days of the date incurred, then such payment shall bear interest at the rate of 2% per month (pro rated for partial months) until such payments are made. (ii) Upon conversion due to the event specified in Section 4(b) above, the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall surrender the Series D Preferred Stock Certificate(s) representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder in the manner described in Section 4(d)(i) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred. Upon such automatic conversion, the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically into shares of Common Stock without any further action on the part of the holders of such shares whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its Transfer Agent; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its Transfer Agent or, if such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s) have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Holder has executed and delivered to the Corporation an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with the shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate(s). (e) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock held in treasury, or both, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and all other securities of the Corporation convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock. (f) Adjustment to Conversion Price; Maximum Share Issuance. (i) If, prior to the conversion of all shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased by a stock split, stock dividend of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock, reclassification or other similar event, the Conversion Price shall be proportionately reduced, or if the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is decreased by a combination or reclassification of shares or other similar event, the Conversion Price shall be proportionately increased, in each case, such that a Holder will have the right to receive upon conversion of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Common Stock (or other shares of capital stock) of the 6
Corporation that such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Holder converted such shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to such action. The Threshold Appreciation Price (as defined in Section 4(c) above) shall likewise be proportionately adjusted upon any increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock on account of any stock split, stock dividend of shares of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock, reclassification or other similar event or upon any decrease in number of outstanding shares of Common Stock on account of any combination or reclassification of shares or other similar event. (ii) In addition to the adjustments set forth above, if the Corporation distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets or debt securities or any rights or warrants to purchase securities other than Common Stock, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted in such a manner as shall be agreed to by the Corporation and the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the shares of Series D Preferred Stock beneficially owned by Robert W. Duggan (the "Duggan Shares")) as shall fairly preserve the economic rights and benefits of each Holder as contemplated by this Certificate of Designations. In the event that within 15 days of any such event, the Corporation and such Holders do not reach an agreement as to the appropriate adjustment, the Corporation shall retain, and pay for, a nationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm to determine the appropriate adjustment as soon as possible, but in any event not later than 45 days, after the date of such event; provided that such investment bank or accounting firm is mutually agreeable to the Corporation and at least ninety percent (90%) of the Holders of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the Duggan Shares). (iii) In the event that, after the Initial Issuance Date, the Corporation shall (other than (A) upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any securities of the Corporation that are exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, shares of Common Stock and that are outstanding as of the Initial Issuance Date, (B) upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock to strategic partners and/or in connection with a strategic merger or acquisition, (C) upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock or options to purchase shares of Common Stock to employees, officers, directors, consultants and vendors in accordance with the Issuer's equity incentive plans in effect on the Initial Issuance Date, (D) upon the issuance of securities pursuant to a shareholder rights plan in effect on the Initial Issuance Date, (E) upon the conversion of any shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock or (F) upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock to pay dividends) at any time while any shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding (x) issue shares of Common Stock without consideration or at a price per share less than the then effective Conversion Price (such Conversion Price, the "Minimum Trigger Price"), (y) issue options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock that provide for (upon the exercise thereof) the issuance of shares of Common Stock without consideration or at a price per share, which when added to the price or other consideration received for such options, rights or warrants, is less than the Minimum Trigger Price or (z) issue securities convertible into Common Stock having a conversion price less than the Minimum Trigger Price, the Conversion Price to be in effect after the date of such issuance shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of any such issuances referenced above by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of 7
the total number of shares of Common Stock so to be issued (or the aggregate issue price of the convertible securities so to be issued) would purchase at the Minimum Trigger Price and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of such issuance plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock to be issued (or into which the convertible securities so to be issued are initially convertible). In case the price for such securities may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be conclusive. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever the date of such issuance is fixed and, in the event that such options, rights, warrants or convertible securities (or portions thereof) expire or are otherwise discharged or redeemed without being exercised or converted, any adjustment in the Conversion Price on account of the issuance of the same shall be reversed. (iv) Adjustments pursuant to this Section 4(f) shall be permanent unless further adjustments are required pursuant to the terms of this Section 4(f). No adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to any of the events or circumstances set forth herein shall be made unless such adjustment shall be in an amount of at least one cent ($0.01); provided, however, that any adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made hereunder but for the fact that it is less than one cent ($0.01) shall be carried forward and made part of any subsequent adjustment that (a) when aggregated with prior adjustment(s) that have not been made because it was (or each of them was) less than one cent ($0.01) or (b) is in excess of one cent ($0.01). (v) If any adjustment under this Section 4(f) would create a fractional share of Common Stock or a right to acquire a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be disregarded and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be the next higher number of shares. (g) Restrictions on Conversion. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4 of this Certificate of Designations, at no time may a Holder convert shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock if the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to such conversion would exceed, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock owned by such holder at such time, the number of shares of Common Stock which would result in such holder owning more than 4.99% of all of the Common Stock outstanding at such time; provided, however, that upon a Holder providing the Corporation with sixty-one (61) days notice (the "Waiver Notice") that such Holder would like to waive Section 4(g) of this Certificate of Designations with regard to any or all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, this Section 4(g) shall be of no force or effect with regard to those shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock reference in the Waiver Notice. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4 of this Certificate of Designations, at no time may a Holder convert shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock if the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to such conversion would exceed, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock owned by such holder at such time, would result in such Holder beneficially owning (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended , and the 8
rules thereunder) in excess of 9.999% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time; provided, however, that upon a Holder providing the Corporation with a Waiver Notice that such Holder would like to waive Section 4(g) of this Certificate of Designations with regard to any or all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, this Section 4(g) shall be of no force or effect with regard to those shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock reference in the Waiver Notice. SECTION 5. REORGANIZATIONS, MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS OR SALE OF ASSETS. If at any time or from time to time after the Initial Issuance Date, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in Section 4(f)), then, as part of such capital reorganization, provisions shall be made so that the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, upon the basis and the terms and conditions specified herein, such shares of stock and/or securities as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of such shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock such that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable in relation to any shares of stock or securities thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock; provided, however, that this Section 5 shall not apply to any Change of Control Transaction (as defined in Section 6) in respect of which the Holders exercise their rights under Section 6. The Corporation shall not effect any such capital reorganization unless the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Corporation) assumes by written instrument the obligation to deliver to the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock such shares of stock and/or securities as such holder is entitled to receive upon conversion in accordance with the foregoing. SECTION 6. CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) A "Change of Control Transaction" shall mean, (i) the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, (ii) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other "Person" (as defined in the Exchange Act) (whether or not the Corporation is the surviving Person) or (iii) (other than a consolidation or merger provided for in clause (ii)) any Person or any "group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), becomes the beneficial owner or is deemed to beneficially own (as described in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act without regard to the 60-day exercise period) in excess of 50% of the Corporation's voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation normally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Corporation (other than (A) any Person or any such group that held such voting power as of the Initial Issuance Date or (B) any group that holds such voting power subsequent to the Initial Issuance Date, provided that the Persons that constitute such group include the Person or a majority of the members of, and at least 50% of the voting power held by, a group referenced in the foregoing clause (A)). (b) Upon the notice or occurrence of, or announcement of the Corporation's intent (or a third party's or parties' intent in the case of a Change of Control Transaction of the type set 9
forth in clause (iii) of the definition of a Change of Control Transaction) to engage in a Change of Control Transaction, the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall, at the option of the Holder thereof, be convertible in full upon the terms set forth in this Section 6(b); provided, however, that the Holder's ability to convert the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall be effective only if the Holder has delivered a Notice of Conversion in accordance with Section 4(d) no later than twelve (12) Trading Days prior to the date of the meeting of the Corporation's stockholders to approve such Change of Control Transaction. In the event that the Holder elects to convert pursuant to this Section 6(b), each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be convertible into that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $1,890 plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends (the "Conversion Amount"), by (y) the average closing bid prices for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately preceding fifteen (15) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the meeting of the Corporation's stockholders to approve such Change of Control Transaction but in no event less than $1.38. The conversion set forth in this Section 6(b) related to a Change of Control Transaction shall be conditioned upon and shall be effective immediately prior to consummation of such Change of Control Transaction and all such shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of Common Stock into which the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was converted. (c) Unless otherwise converted pursuant to Section 6(b), conditioned upon and effective immediately prior to the consummation of a Change of Control Transaction, each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into that number of shares of Common Stock for each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock owned by such Holder on the Trading Day immediately preceding any such Change of Control Transaction as set forth in Section 4(a) of the Series C Certificate of Designations. All such shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of Common Stock into which the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was converted. (d) The Corporation shall promptly mail written notice to the Holder of either the occurrence of, or the announcement of the Corporation's intent to engage in, a Change of Control Transaction (with a copy sent by facsimile), but in any event such notice (other than, if applicable, in the case of a Change of Control Transaction of the type set forth in clause (iii) of the definition of a Change of Control Transaction) shall not be given less than twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of such Change of Control Transaction." SECTION 7. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased, converted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall not be reissued as part of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and shall be retired promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock upon their retirement and 10
the filing of any certificate required in connection therewith pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law shall become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock. SECTION 8. EQUALITY. All Holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth herein. No Holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to or receive terms that are more favorable than those given to any other Holder of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In the event a Holder of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is given by the Corporation or receives from the Corporation terms more favorable than those given by the Corporation or received from the Corporation by any other Holder of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, then in such event all Holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be given and entitled to those more favorable terms. SECTION 9. REGISTERED HOLDER. The Corporation may for all purposes treat the holder of shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock registered on the books of the Corporation as the Holder, notwithstanding any notice or claim by any other Person with respect to any interest in such shares.

(a) Prior to conversion thereof, Holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be voted together with the shares of Common Stock of the Company and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company upon the following basis: each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes. (b) So long as any shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the approval of the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the Duggan Shares), authorize, create or issue any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up as provided in Section 12 below. SECTION 11. RANK. All shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall rank (i) prior to the Common Stock, the Corporation's Series A Junior Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and prior to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation hereafter created other than any series or class of capital stock of the Corporation (A) that has been consented to by the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the Duggan Shares), and (B) that specially, by its terms, ranks senior to or pari passu with the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the Common Stock, the Corporation's Series A Junior Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation hereafter created that does not specifically, by its terms, and 11
in accordance with the terms of this Section 11, rank senior to or pari passu with the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to collectively as "Junior Securities"); (ii) pari passu with the Corporation's Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation hereafter created (A) that has been consented to by the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the Duggan Shares) and (B) that, specifically by its terms and in accordance with the terms of this Section 11, ranks on a parity with the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Pari Passu Securities"); and (iii) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation hereafter created (A) that has been consented to by the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (excluding the Duggan Shares) and (B) that specifically, by its terms, ranks senior to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Senior Securities"), in each case as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary. SECTION 12. LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. (a) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case under the U.S. Federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or if a decree or order for relief in respect of the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under the U.S. Federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law resulting in the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order shall be unstayed and in effect for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days and, on account of any such event, the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, or if the Corporation shall otherwise liquidate, dissolve or wind up (a "Liquidation Event"), no distribution shall be made to the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than Senior Securities and, together with the Holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the Pari Passu Securities) upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless prior thereto the Holders shall have received the Liquidation Preference (as hereinafter defined) with respect to each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. If, upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, the assets and funds available for distribution among the Holders and holders of Pari Passu Securities shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such Holders of the preferential amounts payable thereon, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and the Pari Passu Securities shall be distributed ratably among such shares in proportion to the ratio that the Liquidation Preference payable on each such share bears to the aggregate Liquidation Preference payable on all such shares. (b) The purchase or redemption by the Corporation of stock of any class or series, in any manner permitted by law, shall not, for the purposes hereof, be regarded as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the 12
Corporation with or into any other entity nor the sale or transfer by the Corporation of all or substantially all of its assets shall, for the purposes hereof, be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. (c) The "Liquidation Preference" with respect to a share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock means an amount equal to the Stated Value thereof plus a premium equal to thirty five percent (35%) of the Stated Value thereof, and any other amounts that may be due from the Corporation with respect thereto pursuant to this Certificate of Designations (including, without limitation, accrued and unpaid dividends), the Purchase Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement. The Liquidation Preference with respect to any Pari Passu Securities shall be as set forth in the Certificate of Designations filed in respect thereof and, as applicable, any other agreements related thereto. SECTION 13. LOST OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If a Series D Convertible Stock Certificate shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall execute and deliver, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of such mutilated Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, or in lieu of or in substitution for a lost, stolen or destroyed Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, a new Series D Convertible Stock Certificate for the Series D Convertible Stock Certificate so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Series D Convertible Stock Certificate, and of the ownership thereof, and indemnity, if requested, all reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation.

The failure of the Corporation or the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Certificate of Designations on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Certificate of Designations of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Any waiver must be in writing. The provisions of this Certificate of Designations may not be amended, modified or supplemented unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the Holders of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Series D 13
