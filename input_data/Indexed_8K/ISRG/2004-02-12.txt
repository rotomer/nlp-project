SUNNYVALE, CALIF. February 12, 2004  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the leader in operative surgical robotics, today reported fourth quarter 2003 sales of $27.6 million, increasing 30% from $21.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Higher sales were driven by continued recurring revenue growth and shipments of Surgical System fourth arm upgrades. Fourth quarter 2003 recurring revenue, consisting of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue, totaled $10.1 million, up 107% over the prior year and up $2.2 million, or 28%, sequentially from the third quarter of 2003. Recurring revenue increased to 37% of total sales from 23% during the fourth quarter of 2002.

Intuitive sold 61 total Surgical Systems and 37 fourth surgical arms in 2003 compared to 60 systems and no fourth arms in the previous year. The following table compares fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003 revenue to the prior year.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, Intuitive recognized $5.5 million for charges to impair intangible assets and write-down excess inventory related to Computer Motion Aesop products, of which $5.3 million was charged to cost of sales. Also during the fourth quarter 2003, Intuitive recorded the settlement of its litigation with Brookhill Wilk for $2.6 million, of which $0.6 million was charged to fourth quarter cost of sales. The remaining $2.0 million will be amortized into cost of sales over approximately the next six years on a straight-line basis.
 
Intuitive reported fourth quarter 2003 gross profit of 34.6%, including the 21.3% impact of the Aesop and Wilk charges described above, compared to 50.7% reported for the fourth quarter 2002. The improvement in 2003 gross margin, excluding the Aesop and Wilk charges, was driven by lower product material costs, product reliability improvements, and productivity.
 
Fourth quarter 2003 operating expenses of $15.1 million increased $1.4 million from fourth quarter 2002 operating expenses of $13.7 million. Total fiscal year operating expenses increased 3% to $55.9 million in 2003 from $54.1 million in 2002.
 
Intuitive reported a fourth quarter 2003 net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.16 per share, including the $6.1 million of Aesop and Wilk charges. During the fourth quarter 2002, Intuitive reported a net loss of $2.6 million, or $0.14 per share. Intuitive reported a fiscal year 2003 net loss of $9.6 million, or $0.41 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.4 million, or $1.01 per share in fiscal 2002.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, Intuitive changed its classification of customer training costs from operating expense to cost of goods sold. As a result of this change, fourth quarter 2003 cost of sales included $1.0 million of customer training costs that would have been charged to operating expenses under previous treatment, impacting gross margin by 3.8%. All prior accounting periods are now being presented on a basis consistent with this treatment.
 
Intuitive ended 2003 with $114 million in cash and short-term investments, reflecting $78 million of net proceeds received from the follow-on stock offering closed during the fourth quarter 2003. Excluding the impact of this funding event, the fourth quarter was approximately cash neutral.
 
Commenting on the announcement, Lonnie Smith, Chairman and CEO of Intuitive Surgical said, "We are pleased with our record fourth quarter sales and our substantial recurring revenue growth. During the quarter, we substantially completed the Computer Motion integration, settled the Brookhill Wilk lawsuit, and added significant cash resources with a successful follow-on stock offering. At this stage, we are better positioned than ever to follow through on the promise of robotic surgery."
 
The company will also announce these results at a conference call today at 1:30 PM PST.

About Intuitive's Products
 
The Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
