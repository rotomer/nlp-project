SUNNYVALE, CALIF. February 8, 2005  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the industry leader in surgical robotics, today reported record fourth quarter 2004 sales of $45.2 million, increasing 64% from $27.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Higher sales were driven by higher Surgical System shipments and continued recurring revenue growth.

Intuitive sold 25 Surgical Systems during the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 18 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Fourth quarter 2004 system revenue increased to $27.1 million from $17.5 million during the fourth quarter 2003.

Fourth quarter 2004 recurring revenue, consisting of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue, increased to $18.1 million from $10.1 million during the fourth quarter 2003. Recurring revenue growth resulted from the larger installed base of Surgical Systems and increased system usage.

Total sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 were $138.8 million, up 51% from $91.7 million in 2003. Recurring revenue totaled $60.0 million in 2004, compared to $29.9 million in 2003. Intuitive sold 76 total Surgical Systems in 2004 compared to 61 systems in 2003. The following table compares fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004 revenue to the prior year.

Gross profit increased to $29.8 million, or 65.9% of sales, for the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $9.5 million, or 34.6% of sales, for the fourth quarter 2003, which was negatively impacted by $5.9 million, or 21.3% of sales, due to non-recurring Computer Motion write-downs and the Brookhill Wilk settlement charge. Higher fourth quarter 2004 gross profit was driven by leveraging overhead costs across higher fourth quarter revenue.
 
Fourth quarter 2004 operating expenses of $18.9 million were $3.7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2003.
 
The company reported fourth quarter 2004 net income of $11.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.9 million, or ($0.16) per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2003. Intuitive reported fiscal year 2004 net income of $23.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9.6 million, or ($0.41) per diluted share in fiscal 2003.
 
Intuitive was $10.8 million cash flow positive for the fourth quarter 2004, ending the period with $132.0 million in cash and short-term investments.

About Intuitive's Products:
 
The  Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
