Payments and Royalty Reports
. Hansen shall make royalty payments to ISI in accordance with Section 3 above on a quarterly basis. Within [*] days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, after commercial sales of Hansen Royalty Products has commenced, Hansen shall deliver to ISI a written report setting forth the total number of units of the Hansen Royalty Products sold or otherwise commercially disposed (or, if appropriate, indicating that no Hansen Royalty Product was sold during such calendar quarter) and a calculation of the royalties owed to ISI hereunder for the applicable quarterly period.

Overdue Payments
. If payment of any amount due to ISI becomes overdue, ISI may, without prejudice to its other rights or remedies, charge interest on a day to day basis from the due date until the payment has been paid in full, at the rate of one percent (1.0%) per month or, if less, such other rate as may be the maximum permitted by law.

Taxes
. Hansen shall be permitted to deduct from payments made by Hansen to ISI under this Cross License any foreign or domestic governmental taxes or charges of any kind that Hansen may be required by law to withhold from such payments. Hansen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such taxes or charges. Hansen shall provide ISI with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as is reasonably requested by ISI to establish that such taxes or charges have been paid. If, on the other hand, ISI has the legal obligation to collect such taxes, then ISI alone shall be responsible for paying such amount.
4.4
 
Books And Records; Audit
. Hansen will keep complete and accurate books and records showing the information by which Hansen arrived at a royalty determination and shall, during the Term and for a period of three (3) years after termination of this Cross License, permit a mutually agreed auditor from a nationally recognized firm to inspect and copy said records as such auditor may deem necessary to complete the inspection (but not to exceed one (1) inspection per year and no more than one (1) inspection of records covering any particular time period) solely to verify the accuracy of Hansens royalty reports. Such inspection may be made by ISI hereunder at any time and from time to time during regular business hours upon at least five (5) business days advance written notice. The fees and expenses of such inspection shall be borne by ISI, except that, if an underpayment in royalties of more than five percent (5%) of the total royalties due to ISI hereunder for any payment period is discovered, then such fees and expenses shall be borne by Hansen. If ISI agrees to pay a Hansen licensor royalty or other amounts for the sublicense to ISI of Hansen Patents that are licensed to Hansen, then the above records and audit provisions will apply to ISI
mutatis mutandis
as to ISI products covered by such Hansen Patents.

Term
. This Cross License shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until the expiration of the last to expire of the ISI Patents and the Hansen Patents, (Term), unless earlier terminated in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 5. Upon such expiration, the license rights granted in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 shall survive.

Material Breach
.
(a)
 
If either Party believes that the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement, then such Party may deliver notice of such alleged breach to the other Party. In such written notice, the noticing Party shall identify the actions or conduct that such Party would consider to be an acceptable cure of such breach. The Party receiving such notice shall use diligent efforts to cure such breach as soon as practicable after receiving such written notice to cure such breach, unless such Party believes that it is not in breach, in which case the Parties shall meet promptly thereafter and discuss in good faith the issue and seek to reach a resolution mutually acceptable to both Parties. If the allegedly breaching Party fails to cure such noticed breach, then, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or in Section 5.3 below, the noticing Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement (and each Party covenants and agrees that the Party shall not seek, in any court or other proceeding, to terminate the Agreement as a remedy except as permitted in subsection (b) or Section 5.3 below), but may seek and obtain all other remedies as are available to such Party at law or in equity pursuant to Section 5.7 below, if such breach is proved to have occurred and not have been cured.
(b)
 
If Hansen breaches its obligation to pay royalties as required in Section 3.3, or to pay royalties to a licensor of ISI as contemplated in Section 1.18 for patent rights sublicensed to ISI, then ISI may deliver notice of such breach to Hansen, specifying the amount that is owed and the basis for ISIs belief that such amounts are owed and past-due. If ISI breaches its obligation to pay royalties to a licensor of Hansen as contemplated in Section 1.13 for patent rights sublicensed to ISI, then Hansen may deliver notice of such breach to ISI, specifying the amount that is owed and the basis for Hansens belief that such amounts are owed and past-due. If Hansen or ISI disputes that such amount is actually owed, such dispute shall be resolved (a) by the auditor selected pursuant to Section 4.4, if such dispute is solely as to the amount of royalties owed, and not as to whether there is a royalty obligation for particular products at issue, or (b) by litigation in court in accordance with Section 9.3. The following sentence shall not apply unless and until such dispute is resolved in the non-breaching Partys favor, and the breaching Party does not pay the amount determined to be owed within [*] days of such determination. If the breaching Partys failure to pay when due royalty amounts owed that are in excess of [*], and such Party does not cure such failure to pay the owed royalties by the date [*] days after such notice, then such breach will be deemed to be a Material Breach, for which the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement within 30 days by written notice to the Party in breach, provided if such dispute is resolved in litigation in court, such termination will be effective at such time no appeal is or can be taken from the courts decision.

For the avoidance of doubt, Hansen may raise as affirmative defenses to any infringement action brought by ISI, or as a basis for declaratory relief action brought by Hansen, any and all defenses, available at law or equity, that are available in patent actions. If
such litigation results in a judgment of infringement from which no appeal can be or is taken, and
Hansen, despite such infringement judgment by the court, fails to cease conducting the actions that were determined by the court to be infringing the ISI Patents by the date [*] days after the date after which no appeal can be or is taken (the Determination Date), then such failure shall be a Material Breach, for which ISI may terminate this Agreement within 30 days by written notice to Hansen.

A Party shall have the rights to initiate, on written notice to the other Party, the procedure set forth in Exhibit C at any time, for the Parties to discuss a particular new product being developed by such Party that is intended to be commercialized outside such Partys licensed field (
i.e.,
outside the Hansen Field of Use as to a Hansen new product, or outside the ISI Field of Use as to an ISI new product) to determine if such new product would, if sold in such intended use, infringe any valid and enforceable issued patent in the other Partys patent portfolio.

If a Party (the Initiating Party) initiates pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Agreement the procedure under this Exhibit C as to a new product of such Initiating Party that it plans to sell for a use outside its licensed field (the Subject Product), the Parties shall then proceed under the provisions of this Exhibit C, cooperatively and in good faith. Such Initiating Party shall first provide a demonstration of the Subject Product to the other Party (the Responding Party) and its legal representatives, under an appropriate confidential disclosure agreement entered into by the Parties (and any such representatives).
2. 
   
 
Such Responding Party then has up to [*] business days to provide to the Initiating Party a list of written questions regarding the construction and operation of the Subject Product, and the Initiating Party shall provide its answers to such questions, in confidence under the confidential disclosure agreement, within [*] business days from its receipt of questions.
3. 
   
 
Within [*] business days after timely receipt of the Initiating Partys answers to the written questions submitted under paragraph 2 above, or if no answers were requested or timely received, then within [*] days after the demonstration, the Responding Party shall either: (a) provide the Initiating Party with written notice (a Non-Infringement Notice) that such Responding Party concludes that the Subject Product would not infringe any patents owned or controlled by such Responding Party, or any claims or any claims in any patent applications owned or controlled by such Responding Party were such applications to issue as patents; or (b) provide the Initiating Party with written notice (an Infringement Notice) that such Responding Party believes that the Subject Product would infringe one or more of the patents owned or controlled by such Responding Party, or any claims or any claims in any patent applications owned or controlled by such Responding Party were such applications to issue as patents, which notice shall include details of such allegation and copies of the asserted patents or patent applications and shall provide the detailed analysis for the basis for such Partys belief that the Subject Product infringes that indicated patents or would infringe the indicated patent applications (if such applications issued).
4. 
   
 
If the Responding Party provides an Infringement Notice as to the Subject Product, then the Parties shall meet promptly after such notice is received, and the Parties shall discuss cooperatively and in good faith the infringement issue covered by the Infringement Issue for up to [*] business days and shall amicably and in good faith resolve the infringement issue by [*].
5. 
   
 
If the Parties are unable to reach agreement after such [*] business day period, then the Parties shall proceed under the provisions of Section 5.7(b) to resolve the question of whether the Subject Product infringes one or more claims of the identified patents, including addressing and resolving any defenses that the Initiating Party may have to the assertion of infringement (such as invalidity or unenforceability).

The arbitrators may impose monetary sanctions (payable to the Responding Party) if the Initiating Party does not provide all relevant information relating to the Subject Product requested by the Responding Party or the arbitrators (including demonstrations of the product), or otherwise cooperate fully with them. Similarly, the arbitrators may impose monetary sanctions (payable to the Initiating Party) if the Responding Party does not provide all relevant information relating to the subject patents requested by the Initiating Party or the arbitrators, or otherwise cooperate fully with them. Such arbitration shall determine whether the Subject Product would infringe the Responding Partys patents that are the subject of the Infringement Notice. The arbitrators will set forth in writing their decision regarding infringement or non-infringement of such patents by the Subject Product, including the specific patents and claims analyzed by the arbitrators and an explanation of the bases for such decision. Determinations made by the arbitrators are binding upon the Parties, and cannot be appealed or litigated in federal court. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the arbitrators determine that the Subject Product infringes the Responding Partys patents and the Initiating Party does not cease the infringement within [*] days after the arbitrators decision or in the future sells the Subject Product, then the Responding Party may seek damages and other remedies by litigation in court in accordance with Section 9.3, and to have the court determine if the Initiating Party is selling the Subject Product in violation of the arbitrators determination of infringement. The Responding Party may submit the arbitrators decision in such litigation. If such litigation results in a judgment that the Initiating Party is selling the Subject Product in violation of the arbitrators determination of infringement from which no appeal can be or is taken, then the Initiating Party will have committed a Material Breach, for which the Responding Party may terminate this Agreement within 30 days by written notice to the Initiating Party.
8. 
   
 
In the case of an arbitration under paragraph 7 above, the Responding Party shall pay all arbitration expenses for the aspects of the arbitration that relate to the allegations of infringement, the Initiating Party shall pay all arbitration expenses for the aspects of the arbitration that relate to any of the Initiating Partys asserted defenses, and each Party shall pay its own legal expenses including deposition expenses and other discovery expenses related to these proceedings. If the arbitration results in a determination that the Initiating Party infringes the asserted patents, then the Responding Party shall be entitled to reimbursement the arbitration expenses that it paid. If the arbitration results in a determination that the Initiating Party does not infringe the asserted patents (including because of defenses of the Initiating Party or simply due to non-infringement), then the Initiating Party shall be entitled to reimbursement the arbitration expenses that it paid.
