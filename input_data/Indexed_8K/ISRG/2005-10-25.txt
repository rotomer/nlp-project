Exhibit No. 99.1
Intuitive Surgical Announces Record $60.9 Million Third Quarter Revenue, Up 72%; $0.55 Earnings per Share
SUNNYVALE, CA -- 10/25/2005 -- Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the industry leader in surgical robotics, today reported third quarter 2005 sales of $60.9 million, increasing 72% from $35.5 million for the third quarter of 2004. Higher sales were driven by higher da Vinci Surgical System shipments and continued recurring revenue growth.
Intuitive sold 30 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the third quarter of 2005, compared to 18 in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 system revenue increased to $33.6 million from $19.0 million during the third quarter of 2004.
Third quarter 2005 recurring revenue, consisting of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue, increased to $27.3 million from $16.5 million during the third quarter of 2004. Recurring revenue growth resulted from a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and increased system usage.

About Intuitive's Products:
The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
The Aesop Endoscope Positioner is a voice-activated robotic arm that automates the critical task of endoscope positioning, providing the surgeon with direct control over a smooth, precise and stable view of the internal surgical field.
The Hermes Control Center is a centralized system designed to voice control a series of networked "smart" medical devices.
