Intuitive Surgical Announces Record $72.1 Million Fourth Quarter Revenue, Up 60%
SUNNYVALE, CA -- 02/02/2006 -- Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the industry leader in surgical robotics, today reported fourth quarter 2005 sales of $72.1 million, increasing 60% from $45.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Higher sales were driven by increased da Vinci Surgical System sales and continued growth in recurring revenue.
Intuitive sold 40 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 25 in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 system revenue increased to $41.3 million from $27.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2004.
Fourth quarter 2005 recurring revenue, consisting of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue, increased 70% to $30.8 million from $18.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2004. Recurring revenue growth resulted from a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and increased system usage.
Intuitive reported net sales of $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, increasing 64% from $138.8 million in 2004.

Fourth quarter 2005 operating income increased to $23.5 million, up from $10.9 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2004.
During the fourth quarter 2005, the company released a valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset, resulting in a negative income tax expense of $24.1 million for the period. Including the impact of this tax event, the company reported fourth quarter 2005 net income of $49.5 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the period at $202.7 million, up $13.3 million from last quarter.
Commenting on the announcement, Lonnie Smith, Chairman and CEO of Intuitive Surgical, said, "We are pleased with our fourth quarter revenue and earnings growth. These financial results reflect the continued adoption of da Vinci Surgery in the marketplace and the progress we have made toward our mission of extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to the broadest possible base of patients."

About Intuitive's Products:
The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
The Aesop Endoscope Positioner is a voice-activated robotic arm that automates the critical task of endoscope positioning, providing the surgeon with direct control over a smooth, precise and stable view of the internal surgical field.
The Hermes Control Center is a centralized system designed to voice control a series of networked "smart" medical devices.
