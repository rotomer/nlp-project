Intuitive Surgical Announces Record $77.3 Million First Quarter Revenue, Up 86%
SUNNYVALE, CA -- 04/27/2006 -- Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the industry leader in surgical robotics, today reported first quarter 2006 revenue of $77.3 million, up 86% from $41.6 million for the first quarter of 2005. Higher revenue was driven by increased da Vinci Surgical System sales and continued growth in recurring revenue.
Intuitive sold 35 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the first quarter of 2006, compared with 19 in the first quarter of 2005. First quarter 2006 system sales were positively impacted by the launch of the new da Vinci S System during the quarter as 25 of the 35 system sales were da Vinci S Systems. First quarter 2006 system revenue increased 99% to $42.4 million from $21.3 million during the first quarter of 2005.
First quarter 2006 instrument and accessory revenue increased 81% to $23.3 million from $12.9 million during the first quarter of 2005. Instrument and accessory revenue growth resulted from a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and increased system usage.

First quarter 2006 operating income was $21.7 million compared with $8.9 million for the first quarter of 2005. The results for the first quarter of 2006 included $5.1 million of stock compensation expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards "SFAS" number 123R. Excluding this expense, first quarter 2006 operating income was $26.8 million.
As anticipated, during the first quarter of 2006, Intuitive began to report results on a fully taxed basis. The company's first quarter, 2006 effective tax rate was 39.6%, compared with 5.5% reported for the first quarter of 2005. Although the company has moved to fully taxed reporting, only a small portion of 2006 reported tax expense will result in cash outlay due to the anticipated utilization of net operating loss carry forwards.
Reported net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which includes non-cash stock compensation expense, was $14.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $9.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of stock compensation expenses, first quarter 2006 net income was $17.5 million, or $0.46 per share. A complete reconciliation between GAAP results and results excluding stock compensation is provided in the attached tables.
Intuitive ended the first quarter of 2006 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $221.5 million, up $18.8 million from the previous quarter end. Cash provided by operations for the first quarter of 2006 was $16.1 million, net of $13.5 million utilized during the quarter to fund working capital requirements.
Commenting on the results Lonnie Smith, Chairman and CEO of Intuitive Surgical said, "We are very pleased with our first quarter revenue growth and the positive market response to our da Vinci S System. We remain dedicated to taking surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and believe that our technology has broad and significant implications for the future of healthcare."
The company will report these results at a conference call today at 1:30 pm PDT.

About Intuitive's Products:
The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon's viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons' technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeon's natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeon's console outside the patient's body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
The Aesop Endoscope Positioner is a voice-activated robotic arm that automates the critical task of endoscope positioning, providing the surgeon with direct control over a smooth, precise and stable view of the internal surgical field.
The Hermes Control Center is a centralized system designed to voice control a series of networked "smart" medical devices.
