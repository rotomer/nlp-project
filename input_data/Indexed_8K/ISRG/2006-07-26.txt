The
da Vinci
 Surgical System consists of a surgeons viewing and control console having an integrated, high-performance InSite 3-D vision system, a patient-side cart consisting of three or four robotic arms that position and precisely maneuver endoscopic instruments and an endoscope, and a variety of articulating EndoWrist Instruments. By integrating computer-enhanced technology with surgeons technical skills, Intuitive believes that its system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly and directly translates the surgeons natural hand, wrist and finger movements on instrument controls at the surgeons console outside the patients body into corresponding micro-movements of the instrument tips positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports.
