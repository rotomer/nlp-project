SUNNYVALE, CALIF. April 16, 2009  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG), the industry leader in surgical robotics, today reported first quarter 2009 revenue of $188.4 million, compared to $188.2 for the first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 revenue of $188.4 million was net of $20.1 million of revenue deferrals associated with offers made to certain customers to upgrade their recently purchased  Surgical Systems to our recently announced  Surgical System. The new  Surgical System offers several new features, including enhanced 3D HD resolution, an updated and simplified user interface, enhanced operating room integration capabilities, and improved ergonomics. The also enables an optional second surgeon console allowing a second surgeon the ability to provide -enabled surgical assistance and may facilitate teaching efficiencies for surgeons learning surgery. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to exchange their recently purchased camera accessories for camera accessories. The deferrals reduced first quarter 2009 system revenue by $18.0 million and accessory revenue by $2.1 million. The company expects to recognize all $20.1 million of the revenue deferrals within 2009.

First quarter 2009 instruments and accessories revenue increased to $79.6 million from $61.9 million during the first quarter of 2008 driven by approximately 60% higher surgical procedure volume at customer sites, partially offset by the revenue deferral described above and lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure resulting from customer efficiency gains, procedure mix, and timing of customer orders. First quarter 2009 service revenue increased to $39.3 million from $27.2 million during the first quarter of 2008.
First quarter 2009 systems revenue of $69.5 million was lower than $99.1 million during the first quarter of 2008 due primarily to the revenue deferral described above and slightly lower Surgical System unit sales. 66 Surgical Systems were sold during the first quarter of 2009, compared to 74 during the first quarter of 2008.

First quarter 2009 operating income of $45.0 million was $19.8 million lower than the first quarter 2008 due primarily to the $20.1 million operating income impact of the launch revenue deferral, offset in part by growth in recurring revenue. Operating results for the first quarter of 2009 included $22.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS 123R, compared with $14.6 million for the first quarter of 2008.

First quarter 2009 net income was $28.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $44.8 million, or $1.12 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter 2009 revenue deferral reduced net income by approximately $12.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.
During the first quarter 2009 Intuitive entered into a $150.0 million Accelerated Stock Repurchase program.

Commenting on the announcement, Lonnie Smith, Chairman and CEO of Intuitive Surgical, said, "Despite the challenging economic environment and reduced hospital spending, procedures performed with the surgical system continued to demonstrate relatively high growth. We believe the new Si surgical system's improved 3D HD vision, ease of use, efficiency, and second surgeon console capability will help drive the continued adoption of robotic surgery to the benefit of patients throughout the world."
