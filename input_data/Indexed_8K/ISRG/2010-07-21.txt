Second quarter of 2010 operating income increased to $140 million from $100 million during the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 operating income included the impact of recognizing $14 million of revenue that was originally deferred in the first quarter of 2009. Since there was no cost deferred in association with the deferred revenue, the $14 million of revenue recognized had an equal impact on total revenue, operating income and pretax income. Operating results for the second quarter of 2010 included $30 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense compared with $25 million for the second quarter of 2009.
Second quarter of 2010 net income was $89 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, compared with $62 million, or $1.62 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009. Revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2009 related to the first quarter 2009 revenue deferral increased net income in the second quarter of 2009 by approximately $8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share.
Commenting on the announcement, Gary Guthart, President and CEO of Intuitive Surgical, said, "We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter and our revenue and earnings growth. These financial results reflect continuing surgery adoption, driven by procedures that improve surgical outcomes and reduce trauma."
