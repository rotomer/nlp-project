Third quarter of 2010 operating income increased to $132 million from $105 million during the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2009 operating income included the impact of recognizing $6 million of revenue that was originally deferred in the first quarter of 2009. Since there was no cost deferred in association with the deferred revenue, the $6 million of revenue recognized had an equal impact on total revenue, operating income and pretax income in the third quarter of 2009. Operating results for the third quarter of 2010 included $30 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense compared with $25 million for the third quarter of 2009.
Third quarter of 2010 net income was $87 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared with $65 million, or $1.64 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009. Revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2009 related to the first quarter 2009 revenue deferral increased net income in the third quarter of 2009 by approximately $4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.
