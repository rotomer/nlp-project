About the  Surgical System
da Vinci
The  Surgical System is a breakthrough surgical platform designed to enable complex surgery using a minimally invasive approach. The  Surgical System consists of an ergonomic surgeon console or consoles, a patient-side cart with three or four interactive robotic arms, a high-performance vision system and proprietary  instruments. Powered by state-of-the-art robotic and computer technology, the  Surgical System is designed to scale, filter and seamlessly translate the surgeon's hand movements into more precise movements of the  instruments. The net result is an intuitive interface with breakthrough surgical capabilities. By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, the  Surgical System makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction. This ultimately has the potential to raise the standard of care for complex surgeries, translating into numerous potential patient benefits, including less pain, a shorter recovery and quicker return to normal daily activities.
