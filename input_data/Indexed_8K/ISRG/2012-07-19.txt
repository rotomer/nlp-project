Second quarter of 2012 instruments and accessories revenue increased 30% to $224 million from $172 million in the second quarter of 2011. The growth in instruments and accessories revenue is the result of growth in surgical procedures and the introduction of new products. Procedure growth of approximately 26% primarily reflects higher US gynecologic procedures, US general surgery procedures and international urologic procedures, partially offset by a decline in US prostatectomy procedures.

Second quarter of 2012 systems revenue was $229 million, an increase of 23%, compared with $187 million during the second quarter of 2011. The growth in second quarter 2012 systems revenue was driven by sales of 150 Surgical Systems compared with 129 system sales during the same period last year. Second quarter of 2012 service revenue increased 23% to $83 million from $68 million during the second quarter of 2011, reflecting growth in the installed base of Surgical Systems.
