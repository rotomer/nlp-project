On September 14, 2012 an article was originally published in the Modesto Bee entitled "More Surgeries at Modesto Hospitals Being Done via Remote Control." That article contained information about the estimated number of single incision surgeries that have been performed since January, 2012 and cited Intuitive Surgical Inc. ("the Company") as the source of information. This was an unauthorized disclosure by a field employee in violation of Company policy. The Company does not intend to update this information in the future.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
