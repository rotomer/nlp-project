Exhibit 99.1                                ITW NEWS RELEASE________________________________________________________________________________        ITW Reports a 3 Percent Increase in Diluted Income Per Share from    Continuing Operations in the 2003 First Quarter; Revenues Grow 5 PercentGLENVIEW,  ILLINOIS-(April  16,  2003)-Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) todayreported  that 2003 first  quarter  diluted  income  per share  from  continuingoperations increased 3 percent compared with the 2002 first quarter.  During themost recent quarter,  operating  revenues grew 5 percent while operating  incomeincreased 4 percent. Income from continuing operations in the 2003 first quartertotaled $199.5 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, versus $194.4 million, or63 cents per diluted share, in the year earlier period.The growth in the first quarter  income from  continuing  operations  took placeamidst an environment  where  worldwide end market  conditions  remained  mixed.While the Company's short lead-time  engineered  products have  outperformed thelonger lead-time systems  businesses,  international end markets continued to bebetter  than their  North  American  counterparts.  For the 2003 first  quarter,operating revenues were $2.314 billion compared with $2.205 billion for the yearearlier period.  Operating  income improved to $321.0 million in the most recentquarter  versus $309.9 million in the prior year period.  The Company's  overalloperating margins of 13.9 percent were basically flat in the 2003 first quarter.Net income for the most  recent  quarter  was  $195.4  million,  or 63 cents pershare,  on a fully diluted  basis.  This is  significantly  higher than the yearearlier  period when the Company  changed its  accounting  method for evaluatinggoodwill for impairment  based on the fair value method required by Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards 142. As a result of the cumulative effect of thisrequired accounting change, the Company recorded a net loss of $23.4 million forthe 2002 first quarter.The Company  continued to generate  considerable free operating cash flow in themost recent  quarter due to strong  profitability.  For the 2003 first  quarter,free operating cash flow was $176.7 million  compared with $230.7 million in theyear earlier period. The decrease in cash flow was due to an increase in workingcapital resulting from translation."We view our first  quarter  financial  results as solid  performance  in a timewhere North  American  end markets  were mixed and our margins  were  negativelyimpacted by pension and restricted share expenses," said W. James Farrell, ITW'schairman and chief executive  officer.  "Our base business  performance of minustwo percent in the first quarter is a direct reflection of persistent slowing ina number  of  North  American  end  markets.  Fortunately,  the  results  of ourinternational  businesses  helped  mitigate some of the weaker activity in NorthAmerica."First quarter 2003 segment highlights include:North American  Engineered  Products  revenues  increased 2 percent in the firstquarter mainly due to  contributions  from  acquisitions and base revenue growthfrom businesses  serving  automotive  customers.  Operating  income decreased 11percent  largely  as a result  of  slower  base  business  income  growth in theconstruction,  automotive and industrial  products  businesses as well as higherpension and restructuring expenses. As a result,  operating margins declined 210basis points to 14.8 percent.International  Engineered  Products  first  quarter  revenues were up 22 percentprincipally as a result of the positive impact of currency  translation and basebusiness  growth  from  businesses   serving   customers  in  the  construction,automotive and general industrial sectors.  Operating income grew 50 percent dueto  contributions  from the already  mentioned  businesses  and the  benefits ofcurrency  translation.  First quarter operating margins of 10.4 percent were 190basis points higher than the year ago period.North  American  Specialty  Systems  revenues  declined 5 percent in the quarterlargely  due to base  revenue  decreases  in the food  equipment,  welding,  andmarking and decorating  businesses.  Even with base revenue declines,  operatingincome was flat due to higher restructuring  expense in the year earlier period.As a result,  operating  margins improved 80 basis points to 14.2 percent in thefirst quarter.International  Specialty Systems revenues increased 16 percent mainly due to thepositive  impact of  currency  translation.  Operating  income  grew 34  percentlargely as a result of the  benefits  of  currency  translation  and strong basebusiness  growth  in  the  food  equipment  and  packaging  areas.  Accordingly,operating margins improved 120 basis points to 9.1 percent in the first quarter.Leasing  and  Investments  first  quarter  operating  income  of  $17.4  millionrepresented a 4 percent increase compared with the prior year period.Looking ahead, the Company  continues to be uncertain about economic  conditionsfor  the  remainder  of  2003  and its  impact  on  worldwide  end  markets  andprofitability.  For full-year 2003, the Company is maintaining its wide range ofearnings, with income per diluted share from continuing operations forecasted tobe in the range of $3.02 to $3.42.  For the 2003 second quarter,  the Company isforecasting  income per diluted  share from  continuing  operations to be in therange of 83 cents to 93 cents.This First Quarter 2003 Earnings  Release  contains  forward-looking  statementswithin  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995including,  without limitation,  statements  regarding end market conditions andbase business expectations for full year 2003 and the Company's related earningsforecasts.
