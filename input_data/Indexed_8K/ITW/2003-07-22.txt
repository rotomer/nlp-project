________________________________________________________________________________ GLENVIEW,  ILLINOIS  (July 22, 2003) Illinois Tool Works Inc.  (NYSE:ITW)  todayreported  that 2003  second  quarter  income per diluted  share from  continuingoperations  increased  7 percent  versus the prior year  period  primarily  as aresult of contributions from currency  translation and additional income derivedfrom the Leasing and Investments segment. Operating revenues increased 5 percentand operating income grew 6 percent in the second quarter.Income from continuing operations in the 2003 second quarter was $284.0 million,or 92 cents per diluted  share,  compared with $265.2  million,  or 86 cents perdiluted  share,  in the prior year period.  The growth in the  Company's  secondquarter  financial  results was  accomplished  even though  North  American  andinternational end markets weakened and base business revenues declined 4 percentin the  quarter.  For the most recent  quarter,  operating  revenues  were $2.56billion and operating income was $454.1 million.For the 2003 six month period,  income from  continuing  operations  increased 5percent to $483.5 million,  or $1.57 per diluted share, from $459.6 million,  or$1.49 per diluted share in the prior year period. Operating revenues increased 5percent to $4.88  billion  from $4.64  billion  in the year  earlier  period andoperating  income grew 5 percent to $775.1  million versus $738.9 million in thefirst half of 2002.The Company's free operating cash flow continued to be strong in the 2003 secondquarter and reflected modest working capital needs and capital expenditures as aresult of weak demand in a variety of end markets. For the second quarter,  freeoperating cash flow was $217.7 million."We were pleased with our second quarter results,  particularly  when you factorin the  weak  activity  in our  North  American  end  markets  and  the  slowingconditions internationally," said W. James Farrell, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer.  "We were especially proud of our ability to improve  operating margins10 basis points to 17.7 percent even though our base business  revenues declined4 percent in the second quarter."Segment highlights for the 2003 second quarter and first half include:North American  Engineered  Products second quarter revenues decreased 3 percentand operating  income  declined 14 percent largely due to weakness in businessesassociated with the automotive, construction and industrial-related end markets.As a result,  second  quarter  operating  margins of 17.1 percent  decreased 220basis points from the prior year period. For the first half,  operating revenuesand  operating  income  decreased 1 percent and 13  percent,  respectively,  andoperating  margins of 16.0  percent  were 220 basis  points lower than the prioryear period.International  Engineered  Products second quarter revenues increased 20 percentmainly due to the  positive  impact of  currency  translation  and  modest  basebusiness growth from units serving the automotive and  construction end markets.While  operating  income grew 16 percent  mainly due to the benefits of currencytranslation,  second quarter operating margins of 14.5 percent declined 50 basispoints from the year earlier period.  For the first half,  revenues increased 21percent and operating income grew 27 percent.  Operating margins of 12.6 percentwere 60 basis points higher than the year earlier period.North American  Specialty  Systems second quarter  revenues  decreased 5 percentlargely due to base business revenue declines for the food equipment, packaging,welding  and  finishing  units.  However,  operating  income grew 4 percent as aresult  of  favorable  restructuring   comparisons  as  well  as  ongoing  80/20contributions from the food equipment  businesses.  As a result,  second quarteroperating  margins of 17.1 percent  were 140 basis  points  higher than the yearearlier period.  For the first half,  revenues decreased 5 percent and operatingincome  increased 2 percent.  Operating  margins of 15.7  percent were 110 basispoints higher than the year earlier period.International Specialty Systems second quarter revenues increased 17 percent dueto the positive impact of currency translation.  Operating income grew 8 percentlargely as a result of the benefits of currency  translation  and  acquisitions.Second  quarter  operating  margins of 11.6  percent were 100 basis points lowerthan the  year  earlier  period  mainly  due to the  weakness  in base  businessrevenues.  For the first half,  revenues and operating  income both increased 17percent.  Operating margins of 10.5 percent were 10 basis points higher than theyear earlier period.Leasing and  Investments  second quarter  operating  income of $52.1 million was$27.6   million   higher  than  the  year   earlier   period  due  to  quarterlymark-to-market  adjustments for our swap  agreements in the commercial  mortgageportfolio.  As a result,  Leasing and Investments  operating  margins  increasedconsiderably   and  offset  the  60  basis  points  of  margin  erosion  in  themanufacturing segments.Looking ahead, the Company  continues to be uncertain about economic  conditionsfor the  remainder  of  2003  and the  related  impact  on  North  American  andinternational  end markets.  For  full-year  2003,  the Company is narrowing itsearnings  forecast,  with income per diluted  share from  continuing  operationsexpected to be in the range of $3.12 to $3.32.  For the 2003 third quarter,  theCompany is forecasting income per diluted share from continuing operations to bein the range of 77 cents to 87 cents.This Second Quarter 2003 Earnings  Release contains  forward-looking  statementswithin  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995including,  without limitation,  statements  regarding end market conditions andbase business expectations for full year 2003 and the Company's related earningsforecasts.
