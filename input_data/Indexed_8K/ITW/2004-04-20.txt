Disclosure regarding why the Company's management believes the presentation of "free operating cash flow" provides useful information to investors is included in the Company's 2003 Annual Report of Form 10-K. A reconciliation of free operating cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
        GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(April 20, 2004)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported record earnings as diluted income per share from continuing operations increased 43 percent in the 2004 first quarter. Income from continuing operations in the 2004 first quarter was $290.0 million, or 93 cents per diluted share, versus $199.5 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, for the year earlier period. The Company posted strong across the board results as revenues grew 17 percent, operating income increased 39 percent and operating margins improved 260 basis points.
        The significant growth in first quarter results principally was due to the substantial improvement in the Company's North American end markets in the last two months of the first quarter. The Company's international end markets also improved modestly in the quarter. As a result, total company base revenues increased at a rate of 6.5 percent in the first quarter, its highest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2000. In addition, currency translation and a lower effective tax rate accounted for 8 cents of the 28 cent first quarter increase in diluted income per share from continuing operations.
        For the 2004 first quarter, operating revenues were $2.710 billion compared with $2.314 billion for the year earlier period. Operating income improved to $447.6 million in the most recent quarter versus $321.0 million in the prior year period. The Company's overall operating margins of 16.5 percent were 260 basis points higher than a year ago.
        The Company's free operating cash flow continued to be formidable in the 2004 first quarter at $278.1 million. This strong free cash flow generation continues to allow the Company to fund acquisition activity, which improved markedly in the most recent quarter.
        "We are extremely pleased with the Company's first quarter performance on a variety of levels," said W. James Farrell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "The significant improvement in our income and margin performance in the quarter is clear evidence of the effectiveness of our 80/20 process and our ability to leverage revenue gains in growing end markets. In addition, we closed 10 acquisitions in the quarter, representing $250 million of acquired annual revenues. This pick up in acquisitions gives us increased confidence that pricing requirements by sellers are becoming more reasonable."
        Segment highlights for the 2004 first quarter include:
        North American Engineered Products first quarter revenues increased 6 percent largely as a result of base revenue growth from the construction and industrial-based businesses which offset flat top line performance from the automotive units. Operating income grew 19 percent mainly due to increases from the industrial-based and construction businesses. Income growth also was helped to a lesser degree by lower restructuring expenses and higher acquisition contributions. As a result, first quarter operating margins of 16.7 percent were 190 basis points higher than the year ago period.
        International Engineered Products first quarter revenues grew 28 percent principally due to the benefits of currency translation and base revenue increases from the automotive, construction and industrial-based units. Operating income increased 51 percent as a result of contributions from currency translation, the aforementioned base revenue increases and lower restructuring expenses. First quarter operating margins of 12.3 percent were 190 basis points higher than the year earlier period.
        North American Specialty Systems first quarter revenues increased 17 percent largely as a result of base revenue increases from the welding and industrial packaging units as well as acquisition-related revenues. Operating income grew 40 percent mainly due to contributions from the welding, industrial packaging and food equipment businesses. Income from acquisitions also contributed to income growth in the quarter. First quarter operating margins of 16.7 percent were 270 basis points higher than the year ago period.
        International Specialty Systems first quarter revenues increased 24 percent mainly due to contributions from currency translation and acquisitions. Operating income grew 55 percent largely as a result of the benefits of currency translation, lower restructuring costs and improved base revenue performance from the finishing, decorating and welding businesses. As a result, operating margins of 11.4 percent were 230 basis points higher than the year earlier period.
        Leasing and Investments first quarter operating income of $34.8 million was nearly double the amount from a year ago. This large increase was mainly related to gains recognized on the disposition of multiple properties in the mortgage entities.
        Looking ahead, the Company is increasingly optimistic about its full-year earnings prospects due mainly to the apparent strengthening in the Company's end markets. As a result, for the 2004 second quarter the Company is forecasting an earnings range of $1.04 to $1.12. For the full year, the Company is forecasting a higher earnings range of $4.06 to $4.26. The mid-points of the 2004 second quarter and full-year ranges would represent growth of 17 percent and 23 percent, respectively.

First Quarter
2004

Exhibit 99.3
        GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(April 20, 2004)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the Company to buy back up to 31 million shares, or nearly 10 percent of its current shares outstanding. The Company had approximately 310 million shares outstanding at the end of March 2004.
        As a result of the board resolution, the Company intends to use much of its strong cash positionapproximately $1.7 billionto acquire 21 million shares over the next year through open market and private transactions. The remaining 10 million shares would be repurchased only if future conditions such as cash balances, interest rates and stock valuations proved to be attractive. The stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice.
        "We view ITW's first-ever stock repurchase program as an attractive way to return a significant amount of our cash to shareholders," said W. James Farrell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Looking to the future, we strongly believe that we will have ample free cash flow and debt capacity to fund our long-term earnings per share growth target of 12 percent to 18 percent. Our ability to generate free cash will continue to enable us to grow our base businesses, implement 80/20 related restructuring activities and fund our North American and internationally based acquisitions."
        The Company will discuss this share repurchase program today as part of its First Quarter 2004 earnings conference call that will be held at 1 p.m. central time. Participants can access the share repurchase and first quarter 2004 earnings information via the Company's synchronized slide show accompanying its audio webcast at or through a teleconference by dialing 630-395-0017.
