Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 10, 2004, the Board of Directors of Illinois Tool Works Inc. amended the Illinois Tool Works Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to allow the Compensation Committee of the Board to modify certain restricted stock grants in order to vest the grants at the holder's retirement, disability or death. Copies of the amendment to the Plan and the forms of restricted stock agreements and stock option terms utilized in granting awards to executive officers are attached as Exhibits 10.1-10.4 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
On December 10, 2004, the Board of Directors also amended the Illinois Tool Works Inc. Executive Contributory Retirement Income Plan, as amended and restated as of January 1, 1999 ("1999 ECRIP"), in order to permit participants to continue their deferrals of compensation for periods commencing on and after January 1, 2005. A copy of the amendment to the 1999 ECRIP is attached as Exhibit 10.5 of this report and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of an earlier amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.6.
As previously disclosed in the Company's previous proxy statements, executive officers receive annual cash bonuses under its Executive Incentive Plan based on predetermined financial and non-financial objectives. The maximum bonus opportunities range from 70% to 200% of base salary. The Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairmen and certain executive officers can earn half of the maximum bonus opportunity if the Company's net income achieves certain predetermined levels for the particular fiscal year for which the bonuses will be paid. The other half of the maximum bonus opportunity relates to the individual's performance measured against predetermined management goals, for example, succession planning, cost reduction targets, market penetration, acquisition planning and a variety of other objectives specifically related to the individual unit's performance. For the Executive Vice Presidents, one-eighth of the maximum bonus opportunity is based on the Company's net income, three-eighths is based on the operating income of the operating units for which the individual is responsible, and the remaining one-half is based on the individual's performance measured against evaluation factors similar to the Chief Executive Officer's.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
: that the second sentence of Section 9(b) of the Illinois Tool Works Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan is hereby amended to read as follows:
RESOLVED
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Shares granted January 2, 2003 and January 2, 2004, shall not become fully vested upon termination of employment by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise."

Exhibit 10.2
__________ __, 20___
Name Business Unit
Dear __________:
On __________ __, 20___, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted you _________ restricted shares of ITW common stock the market value of which would be the average of the high and low share price on the grant date.
The shares are "restricted" because you may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber them until they vest and are distributed to you. The restricted shares will vest and be distributed to you in three annual installments on __________ __, 20___, __________ __, 20___ and __________ __, 20___, but only if you are employed by ITW or one of its subsidiaries on the date that they are scheduled to vest. If your employment terminates for any reason prior to __________ __, 20___, all unvested restricted shares will be forfeited. The Compensation Committee also may forfeit any unvested shares if they determine that you have acted in a manner adversely affecting ITW.
You have the right to vote the restricted shares and to receive dividends commencing with the dividend to be paid to stockholders on __________ __, 20___. The dividends will be taxable income to you subject to withholding. You also will recognize taxable income subject to withholding on each date that the restricted shares vest. Such taxable income will equal the fair market value of ITW common stock on the vesting date multiplied by the number of restricted shares that vest on that date. Alternatively, you may elect to recognize taxable income this year on all or a portion of the restricted shares by filing an election with the Internal Revenue Service prior to __________ __, 20___, a very short time period. For more information concerning this election we also recommend that you consult with your accountant or other tax advisor.
Your rights with respect to the restricted shares are contingent upon your satisfaction of all applicable tax withholding obligations. The restricted shares are subject to the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan, as described in the attached Prospectus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of the Plan providing for vesting upon retirement, death or disability do not apply to these restricted shares.
If you have any questions regarding this grant contact Robyn McCarthy at 847-657-4225 or Heather Liay at 847-657-4520.
A Form 4 has been filed by ITW with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report the grant of the restricted shares. Any sale by you of the restricted shares after they vest is subject to window period requirements and timely filing on Form 4.
Yours sincerely,
W. James Farrell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
