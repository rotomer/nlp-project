Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 19, 2005, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2005 first quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Company's presentation from the first quarter conference call held on April 19, 2005 is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
Disclosure regarding why the Company's management believes the presentation of "free operating cash flow" provides useful information to investors is included in the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. A reconciliation of free operating cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
        GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(April 19, 2005)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) today reported 14 percent growth in diluted net income per share in the 2005 first quarter. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.06 versus $0.93 in the 2004 first quarter. In addition, the Company's first quarter revenues increased 13 percent, operating income grew 7 percent and net income rose 8 percent.
        The double digit growth in diluted net income per share in the first quarter was partially due to the Company's ongoing strength in the North American Specialty Systems' business units, which provide equipment and consumables for end market replacement and expansion activities. As a result, this segment helped total company base revenues grow at a rate of 6.1 percent in the first quarter. In addition, revenues and operating income increased due to contributions from acquisitions and translation. First quarter earnings growth was achieved even though the Company adopted a new accounting rule early and began expensing stock options. The pre-tax cost associated with the expensing of stock options in the first quarter was approximately $6.8 million. The Company anticipates that it will incur an additional $18.8 million of stock option expense in the remaining three quarters of 2005.
        For the 2005 first quarter, operating revenues were $3.074 billion compared to $2.710 billion for the year earlier period. Operating income improved to $477.9 million in the most recent quarter versus $447.6 million in the prior year period. Net income was $312.3 million in the first quarter compared to $290.2 million a year ago. The Company's overall margins of 15.5 percent were 100 basis points lower than a year ago as margin declines in Engineered Products North America, Specialty Systems International and Leasing and Investments more than offset gains in the remaining two segments.
        The Company's free operating cash flow continued to be formidable in the 2005 first quarter at $254 million. This strong free cash flow generation allows the Company to continue to fund acquisition activity, which reached $151 million of annualized acquired revenues in the first quarter. The Company is forecasting acquired revenues of $600 to $800 million of annualized revenues for full-year 2005.
        "We are pleased with our operating and earnings performance in the first quarter, especially as we moved proactively to expense stock options for 2005," said W. James Farrell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain cautiously optimistic about our end market prospects and our operating performance for the second quarter and the remainder of the year."
        Segment highlights for the 2005 first quarter include:
        North American Engineered Products first quarter revenues increased 13 percent largely as a result of acquisitions and base revenue growth from the industrial and construction business units. Automotive base revenues declined 1 percent in the first quarter. Operating income grew 4 percent mainly due to contributions from acquisitions and lower impairment charges versus a year ago. Base income was down slightly as declines related to pricing issues at the automotive units more than offset increases from the industrial units. As a result, first quarter operating margins of 15.7 percent were 130 basis points lower than the year earlier period.
        International Engineered Products first quarter revenues grew 23 percent due to contributions from acquisitions, translation and construction and industrial base revenues. Operating income increased 31 percent as a result of lower impairment charges versus the year earlier period as well as contributions from acquisitions and currency translation. Base operating income was up modestly thanks to the construction and industrial units. First quarter operating margins of 13.0 percent were 70 basis points higher than the year earlier period.
        North American Specialty Systems first quarter revenues increased 11 percent largely as a result of base revenue increases from a broad array of business units, including welding, food equipment, marking and decorating, and industrial packaging. Operating income grew 17 percent mainly due to strong base income contributions from the previously mentioned business units. As a result, first quarter operating margins of 17.6 percent were 100 basis points higher than the year ago period.
        International Specialty Systems first quarter revenues increased 14 percent mainly due to base revenue growth and contributions from translation. Base revenue growth was attributable to the performance of industrial packaging in Europe and Asia, food equipment and welding. Operating income declined 10 percent as a decrease in base income and increased restructuring more than offset gains from translation. The decrease in base income also reflected one time adjustments in a European food equipment business related to accounting issues. First quarter operating margins of 9.1 percent were 240 basis points lower than the year earlier period.
        Leasing and Investments first quarter operating income of $18.8 million was 46 percent lower than the year earlier period. The decline in income was principally due to the planned lower income associated with the mortgage portfolio.
        Looking ahead, the Company is expecting its operating results to improve modestly as the year progresses. As a result, for the 2005 second quarter the Company is forecasting an earnings range of $1.30 to $1.36. For the full year, the Company is forecasting an earnings range of $5.06 to $5.20. The mid-points of the 2005 second quarter and full-year forecasted ranges would represent earnings growth of 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively.
