SECTION 3.
Right to Indemnification
. Any indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections 1 and 2.
