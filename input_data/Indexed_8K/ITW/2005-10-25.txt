Item 5.04.
          
Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Company's Employee Benefit Plans.
 
On October 25, 2005, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that a blackout period with respect to the ITW Savings and Investment Plan and the ITW Bargaining Savings and Investment Plan (collectively referred to as the Plan) will commence on November 30, 2005 at 2 p.m. central time and is expected to end during the week beginning Sunday, December 11, 2005. The Company provided the notice to its directors and executive officers in accordance with Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR. On October 25, 2005, the Company received from the Plan administrator the notice required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The Company will provide notice of the actual ending date of the blackout period to its directors, executive officers and all Plan participants as soon as practicable after the date is determined, and during the blackout period and for a period of two years after the end of the blackout period, a security holder or other interested person may obtain, without charge, the actual beginning and end dates of the blackout period by writing to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 3600 West Lake Avenue, Glenview, IL 60026.
A copy of the Company's notice to its directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Important Notice Concerning Blackout Period/General Trading Prohibition
 
 
 
 
This notice is to advise you, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR (Blackout Trading Rules), that during an upcoming blackout period you will be prohibited from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any ITW common stock that you acquired "in connection with service or employment as a director or executive officer" of ITW. The period during which you will be prohibited from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any ITW common stock corresponds to a blackout applicable to participants in the ITW Savings and Investment Plan and the ITW Bargaining Savings and Investment Plan (referred to collectively as the Plan), which will begin on November 30, 2005 at 2 p.m. central time and is expected to end during the week of December 11, 2005.
ITW will provide notice of the actual ending date of the blackout period to you (and to all Plan participants) as soon as practicable after the date is determined. This prohibition applies to all of your ITW common stock held both inside and outside of the Plan. We know that you are already precluded during this blackout period from trading in ITW common stock under ITW's general insider trading policy, which allows trades only during specific window periods (the December window is December 16 through the 22), but are nevertheless providing you with this notice to assure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley and Regulation BTR.

nd
The Plan blackout arises in connection with amendments to the Plan that change investment options, various Plan features and the Plan record keeper. If you have any questions about this notice, please contact me (847-657-4187) or Robert Simitz (847-657-4665) by telephone or by mail at Illinois Tool Works Inc., 3600 West Lake Avenue, Glenview, Illinois 60026.
