If stockholders approve the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, management will recommend at the May 5, 2006 meeting of the Board of Directors of the Registrant that the Board approve an amendment to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan which would limit the number of authorized shares that may be issued in the form of stock awards, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to 5,000,000 shares in the aggregate, and eliminate the Registrant's ability to re-use shares surrendered or withheld to pay withholding taxes or option exercise prices.
