ITW Reports Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations of 87 Cents in the 2007 Fourth Quarter; Revenues Increased 19 Percent, Operating Income Grew 14 Percent and Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations was 19 Percent Higher in the Quarter
 
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(January 30, 2008)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) today reported 19 percent growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations in the 2007 fourth quarter. Diluted income per share from continuing operations was $0.87 versus $0.73 in the 2006 fourth quarter. Notably, revenues increased 19 percent and operating income grew 14 percent in the most recent quarter. As previously announced, certain divested businesses and businesses currently being held for sale which collectively reached a more significant level are now being reported as discontinued operations.
The double-digit increase in fourth quarter diluted income per share from continuing operations was helped by strong top line growth. Acquisitions contributed 10.8 percent to total revenues while base revenues grew at a rate of 2.5 percent and currency translation added 6.1 percent. Similar to past quarters, the Company benefited from strong base revenue growth from its international operations. International base revenues increased 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter while North American base revenues grew 0.8 percent. A lower than expected fourth quarter tax rate of 26.7 percent had a favorable impact of 3 cents per diluted share versus the Company's previous earnings guidance.
For the 2007 fourth quarter, revenues were $4.244 billion versus $3.570 billion for the prior year period. Fourth quarter operating income improved to $665.7 million from $582.5 million a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $469.9 million compared to $416.8 million in the prior year period, an increase of 13 percent. The Company's fourth quarter operating margins of 15.7 percent were 60 basis points lower than a year ago due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Base margins in the fourth quarter actually improved 30 basis points versus a year ago.
For full-year 2007, revenues increased 17 percent, operating income grew 10 percent, income from continuing operations rose 9 percent and diluted income per share from continuing operations was 11 percent higher than the year-ago period. Revenues were $16.171 billion compared to $13.799 billion for full-year 2006. Operating income was $2.624 billion versus $2.385 billion. Income from continuing operations was $1.826 billion compared to $1.681 billion and diluted income per share from continuing operations was $3.28 versus $2.95. Total company operating margins of 16.2 percent for full-year 2007 were 110 basis points lower than 2006, even though base revenue margins improved 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis.
The Company's free operating cash flow was a robust $694 million in the fourth quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. Free cash was utilized, in part, to acquire 15 companies during the fourth quarter representing $165 million of acquired revenues. For full-year 2007, the Company completed 52 acquisitions totaling $995 million of annualized revenues and paid less than one time revenues for these transactions. During the fourth quarter, the Company also paid $799 million to repurchase 14.4 million shares as part of its ongoing, open-ended buyback program. For the full year, the Company paid $1.8 billion to repurchase 32.4 million shares.
"Despite slowing in a number of North American end markets, we were helped by the strength of our international end markets and improved contributions from our acquisitions to produce a fourth quarter highlighted by both double digit revenue and earnings growth," said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. "While we expect 2008 to be a challenging year, we believe the Company will benefit in the upcoming year from our increasingly diversified end markets and geographies as well as our acquisition activity."
North American Engineered Products fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7 percent largely due to a 3.6 percent revenue contribution from acquisitions. Base revenues declined 1.8 percent in the quarter mainly due to weak results from the construction-related businesses, especially those serving the housing sector. In the fourth quarter, construction base revenues declined four percent while base revenues for the automotive and industrial-based units were flat. Segment operating income grew 3.6 percent due to contributions from acquisitions, translation and base income. As a result, fourth quarter operating margins of 15.5 percent were 20 basis points higher than the year-ago period. For the full year, revenues increased 1.5 percent, operating income declined 4.7 percent and operating margins of 16.3 percent were 100 basis points lower than the year-ago period.
International Engineered Products fourth quarter revenues and operating income increased 35.8 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively. Revenues grew significantly as acquisitions contributed 16.2 percent and base revenues added 6.6 percent. Translation contributed 13.3 percent to revenues. Base revenues and income benefited from contributions from the construction, automotive and industrial operations. The growth in operating income was due to contributions from translation, acquisitions and base income. Operating margins of 14.8 percent were 170 basis points lower than the year-ago period mainly due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. For the full year, revenues increased 33.7 percent, operating income grew 27.7 percent and operating margins of 14.3 percent were 70 basis points lower than a year ago.
North American Specialty Systems fourth quarter revenues increased 8.2 percent largely due to 4.5 percent growth from acquisitions and a 2.9 percent contribution from base revenues. The food equipment and welding businesses contributed significantly to base revenue growth in the quarter. Operating income increased 6.7 percent in the quarter, with base income contributing the majority of that growth. Operating margins of 16.8 percent were 30 basis points lower than the prior year period due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. For the full year, revenues increased 10.7 percent, operating income grew 5.2 percent and operating margins of 18.5 percent were 90 basis points lower than full-year 2006.
 
International Specialty Systems fourth quarter revenues and operating income increased 34.9 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively. Growth in revenues was mainly due to the 21.2 percent increase from acquisitions and the 11.7 percent contribution from translation. Base revenues grew 2.5 percent in the quarter, led by contributions from the food equipment, welding and the test and measurement businesses. Operating income benefited from translation, base income and acquisitions. Contributions from welding, food equipment and industrial packaging drove base income growth. Operating margins of 13.8 percent were 20 basis points lower than the year ago period due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Notably, base margins improved 120 basis points versus a year ago. For the full year, revenues increased 33.0 percent, operating income grew 27.5 percent and operating margins of 13.2 percent were 60 basis points lower than full-year 2006.
The Company also announced that based on a change in its internal reporting in the fourth quarter of 2007, it is changing its segment reporting. The eight new reporting segments are as follows: industrial packaging; power systems and electronics; transportation; construction products; food equipment; decorative surfaces; polymers and fluids; and other. The operating results for the new segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005 will be presented on a worldwide basis in the 2007 Form 10-K which is scheduled to be filed in late February of 2008.
Looking ahead, the Company is forecasting a full-year 2008 diluted income per share from continuing operations range of $3.47 to $3.61. The full-year forecast assumes a total company revenue growth range of 6 percent to 10 percent. For the 2008 first quarter, the Company is forecasting income per share from continuing operations of $0.72 to $0.78. The 2008 first quarter forecast assumes a total company revenue growth range of 8 percent to 11 percent. The mid-points of the full-year and first quarter ranges would represent earnings growth of 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
