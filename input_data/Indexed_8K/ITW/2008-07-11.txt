On July 11, 2008, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW"), as Borrower, terminated a 364-day credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated May 8, 2008, with UBS AG, Stamford Branch ("UBS"). ITW had entered into the Credit Agreement to obtain access to the committed funds needed to finance its offer for Enodis plc ("Enodis"). ITW's decision to terminate the Credit Agreement was made as a result of the completion of the Enodis auction process and Enodis' announcement of the posting of the Scheme of Arrangement by a rival bidder. The Credit Agreement would have expired or terminated on May 7, 2009, and was limited to aggregate borrowings of a principal amount not in excess of 1,350,000,000. The Credit Agreement contained typical representations, warranties and covenants. No funds were drawn under the Credit Agreement.
 
There were no material relationships between the Company or its affiliates and UBS, other than as described above. No termination fees will be incurred in connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement and any costs associated with the termination are not expected to be material.
