ITW Reports Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.01 in the 2008 Second Quarter; Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations Grew 17 Percent and Revenues Increased 10.5 Percent in the Quarter
 
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(July 17, 2008)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) today reported 17 percent growth in 2008 second quarter diluted income per share from continuing operations. In addition, the Company's revenues grew 10.5 percent, operating income increased 8.8 percent and income from continuing operations rose 10.0 percent in the most recent quarter.
 
The double-digit operating revenue increase in the quarter consisted of a 4.3 percent contribution from acquisitions and a 6.4 percent contribution from currency translation. Base revenues were flat in the quarter, with international base revenues growing 3 percent and North American base revenues declining 2 percent. For the 2008 second quarter, revenues were $4.570 billion versus $4.137 billion for the prior year period. Second quarter operating income was $756.7 million compared to $695.6 million. Income from continuing operations was $528.5 million versus $480.4 million.
 
In the 2008 second quarter, total company operating margins of 16.6 percent were 20 basis points lower than the prior year period due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions and higher restructuring costs. Acquisitions lowered margins 30 basis points while restructuring reduced margins 20 basis points versus the year ago period. Notably, base margins were 30 basis points higher than a year ago.
 
"We believe our operating performance in the second quarter exemplifies the Company's ability to outperform across slowing end markets thanks to our decentralized operating structure and our aggressive efforts to manage operating costs," said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition, we remain focused on value-adding acquisitions as evidenced by the more than $500 million of acquired revenues we purchased through the end of the second quarter."
 
Highlights for the 2008 second quarter include:
 
*Worldwide base revenues for the Power Systems and Electronics segment grew 7.7 percent in the quarter. Worldwide welding base revenues increased 8.9 percent and worldwide PC board fabrication base revenues grew 6.9 percent. Operating margins of 21.9 percent for the segment were 140 basis points higher than a year ago.
 
*Worldwide base revenues for the Polymers and Fluids segment increased 2.3 percent in the quarter. The segment was led by North American polymers which grew base revenues 9.4 percent. Operating margins of 18.3 percent for the segment were 60 basis points higher than the year ago period.
 
*Worldwide base revenues for the Transportation segment declined 4.7 percent in the quarter, with North American automotive base revenues decreasing 12.8 percent while international base revenues were essentially flat. North American automotive base revenues decreased only 13 percent even though Detroit 3 auto builds fell 21 percent in the quarter. New domestic auto builds decreased 1 percent in the quarter. Operating margins of 15.8 percent for the segment were 260 basis points lower than a year ago.
 
*Worldwide base revenues for the Construction segment decreased 4.3 percent in the quarter. North American construction base revenues declined 12.4 percent in the quarter while international base revenues grew 1.7 percent. Operating margins of 13.8 percent were 120 basis points lower than the year ago period.
 
*The Company's free operating cash flow was $354.1 million in the second quarter. Free cash was utilized, in part, to acquire 10 companies in the second quarter representing $308 million of annualized revenues. Through June 30, 2008, the Company has completed 26 acquisitions representing $538 million of annualized revenues. The most notable acquisition in the second quarter was Stokvis, a specialty die cast adhesives business based in the Netherlands. With $261 million in revenues, Stokvis operates in 22 countries and serves broad end markets.
 
*Free cash was also employed to repurchase shares. In the second quarter, the Company paid $200 million to repurchase 3.9 million shares. Through June 30, the Company has paid $585.6 million to repurchase 11.8 million shares. The Company's debt-to-capitalization at June 30, 2008 was 24 percent.
 
Looking ahead, the Company is forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.93 to $0.99 for the 2008 third quarter. The 2008 third quarter forecast assumes a total company growth range of 10 percent to 14 percent. The Company is increasing its full-year diluted income per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.40 to $3.52. The full-year forecast assumes a total company revenue growth range of 9 percent to 12 percent. The full-year forecast also reflects a 22 cent after-tax charge to earnings taken in the first quarter due to impairment and European tax charges.
