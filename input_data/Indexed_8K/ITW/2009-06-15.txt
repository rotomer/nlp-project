ITW NEWS RELEASE
 
ITW Reports a 26 Percent Decrease in Operating Revenues for Three Months
Ended May 31, 2009; Base Revenues Show Ongoing Stabilization; Return of Decorative Surfaces Segment to Continuing Operations Adds 4 Cents of Earnings to Revised Second Quarter 2009 Forecast of $0.29 to $0.41
 
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(June 15, 2009)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) today reported an operating revenue decrease of 26 percent for the three months ended May 31, 2009. The revenue decline for the three months was due to a 23 percent decrease in base revenues and a 9 percent decline in contributions from currency translation. Acquisitions contributed 6 percent to revenues in the three month period. The Companys base revenues continue to stabilize as core revenues have been in a range of
-21 percent to -25 percent for the past 5 months of January through May 2009.
 
On a segment basis, the Companys three month moving average percentage change for operating revenues, comprised of base revenues, acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, is provided below.
 
 
 
Due to the Decorative Surfaces segment being placed back into continuing operations as was announced on May 8, 2009, the segment is expected to add four cents to income per share from continuing operations in the current quarter. As a result, the Company is now forecasting second quarter 2009 diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.41. On a restated basis, Decorative Surfaces also added four cents of earnings to ITWs 2009 first quarter results. The updated second quarter forecast assumes a total revenue improvement of 5 percent to 11 percent compared to the restated first quarter of 2009.

These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys expectations are set forth in ITWs Form 10-Q for the 2009 first quarter.
