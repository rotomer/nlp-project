This Severance, Release and Proprietary Interests Protection Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and among Illinois Tool Works Inc. ("Company") including its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively "the Company") and Russell M. Flaum (" Flaum") (collectively the "Parties") on the dates shown below.

In consideration of the mutual promises, monies and other valuable consideration, contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to protect the Company's intellectual property, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary interests, Flaum agrees as follows:
 
 
 
 
In accordance with the Older Worker's Benefit Protection Act of 1990, Flaum is aware of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Parties agree that they will not disclose the terms of this Agreement to anyone unless required to do so by law; provided however, that the terms of this Agreement may be disclosed in confidence to management personnel, attorneys and staff personnel of the Company who have a legitimate business need to know, and may be disclosed in confidence to Flaum's immediate family, attorney, and any tax or financial consultant retained to assist Flaum, provided that such persons agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement unless required to do so by law. The unauthorized disclosure of the terms of this Agreement by any person shall constitute a violation of this paragraph by the party who initially disclosed the terms of this Agreement.
 
Flaum agrees to refrain from any publication or any type of communication, oral or written, of a defamatory, disparaging or otherwise derogatory nature pertaining to the Company or any of the Company's business interests, products or employees.
 
 
Neither the execution nor the performance of any term of this Agreement shall constitute or be construed as an admission of any liability to Flaum whatsoever by the Company, which has consistently taken the position that it has no liability, and will incur no liability, to Flaum whatsoever in connection with any Claims. This Agreement is intended solely to avoid even the possibility of any dispute or claim relating to the termination of Flaum's employment.
 
 
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and all disputes hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard for conflicts of law.
 
 
Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of each of the parties hereto and must expressly state that it is the intention of each of the parties hereto to amend the Agreement.
 
 
The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be found by any court to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remainder of this Agreement shall nevertheless be enforceable and binding on the parties. Flaum also agrees that the court may modify any invalid, overbroad or unenforceable term of this Agreement so that such term, as modified, is valid and enforceable under applicable law.
 
 
This Agreement represents the sole and entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations and discussions between the Parties hereto and/or their respective counsel with respect to the subject matters covered hereby.
 
 
The obligations of Flaum contained in this Agreement may not be assigned by him. The Company may assign its rights contained in this Agreement to the Company, or any affiliate, or subsidiary; and shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successors and assigns. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if this Agreement is assigned, it shall remain binding on the assigning party in any event.
 
 
The Parties shall cooperate to effectuate, and shall undertake such actions as are reasonably necessary to effectuate, this Agreement.
 
 
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
 
 
In the event of any litigation between the Parties regarding the terms, provisions or enforceability of this Agreement, the party prevailing in such litigation shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
the Parties hereto have executed this Separation, Release, and Proprietary Interests Protection Agreement.
