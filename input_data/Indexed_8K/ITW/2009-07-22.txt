ITW NEWS RELEASE
 
ITW Reports Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations of $0.36 in the 2009 Second Quarter Despite Higher Than Expected Tax Rate; Operating Margins of 9.9 Percent Improve 410 Basis Points Versus the 2009 First Quarter; Company's Free Operating Cash Flow Totals Strong $567 Million in the Quarter
 
GLENVIEW, ILLINOISJuly 22, 2009Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.36 in the 2009 second quarter as cumulative restructuring activities helped drive income and operating margins to significantly higher levels versus the 2009 first quarter. In the 2009 second quarter, operating income of $334.8 million equated to operating margins of 9.9 percent. Excluding the impact of impairment charges in the 2009 first quarter, second quarter operating margins were 410 basis points higher than the preceding quarter.
 
Second quarter 2009 operating revenues of $3.393 billion were 25.5 percent lower than the year ago period as end markets stabilized but remained weak around the world. As a result, the Company's base revenues declined 22.2 percent in the 2009 second quarter versus a year ago, with North American base revenues decreasing 26.8 percent and international base revenues declining 17.3 percent. Second quarter operating margins of 9.9 percent were 670 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter, with base margins declining 400 basis points. Diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.36 was 64.4 percent lower than the year-ago period. However, the Company's effective tax rate of 34.0 percent in the second quarter was higher than the April 2009 forecasted second quarter tax rate of 25.0 percent, resulting in five cents of reduced earnings. The higher tax rate in the second quarter was due to discrete tax adjustments related to German tax audits and the previously announced reclassification of Decorative Surfaces to continuing operations.
 
The Company's strong second quarter free operating cash flow of $567 million was $213 million higher than the year-ago period and was largely driven by reductions in working capital. In the quarter, the net income to free operating cash flow conversion rate was 321 percent. First half 2009 free operating cash flow totaled $950 million.
 
"We are pleased the Company's base revenues appear to have stabilized during the second quarter as well as with the significant improvement in our operating performance compared to the 2009 first quarter," said David B. Speer, ITW's chairman and chief executive officer. "Notably, our operating margins of nearly 10 percent in the second quarter were driven by improved margin performance in all eight of our operating segments. These segments all benefited from our aggressive and targeted restructuring programs. We incurred $65 million of restructuring in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $98 million. And we expect to incur an additional $50 million to $70 million of restructuring dollars in the second half of 2009. These decentralized restructuring activities will have both short-term and long-term benefits for our Company and our earnings profile in 2009 and beyond."
 
 
*Worldwide revenues for the Power Systems and Electronics segment declined 38.6 percent in the quarter, with base revenues decreasing 36.5 percent. Total worldwide welding base revenues fell 37.0 percent as demand for capital equipment was weak in the quarter. The PC board fabrication businesses' base revenues declined 59.2 percent in the quarter. Ground support equipment's base revenues increased 4.0 percent in the quarter. Segment operating margins of 15.3 percent were 660 basis points lower than the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of impairment charges in the 2009 first quarter, second quarter operating margins were 260 basis points higher than the preceding quarter.
 
*Worldwide revenues for the Transportation segment declined 20.3 percent in the quarter, with base revenues decreasing 23.7 percent. Both metrics were significantly better than the 2009 first quarter. The sequential quarter-to-quarter improvement in base revenues was largely attributable to increased auto builds in Europe. Worldwide automotive base revenues declined 30.2 percent in the second quarter as North American auto builds fell 49 percent and international auto builds decreased 31 percent. Comparable North American and international first quarter 2009 auto builds declined 51 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Automotive aftermarket base revenues decreased 12.7 percent in the quarter. Operating margins of 4.8 percent were 1100 basis points lower than the year ago period. Excluding the impact of impairment charges in the 2009 first quarter, second quarter operating margins were 800 basis points higher than the preceding quarter.
 
*Worldwide revenues for the Food Equipment segment declined 16.2 percent in the second quarter, with base revenues decreasing 8.5 percent. North American food equipment base revenues decreased 8.4 percent while international food equipment base revenues declined 10.2 percent in the quarter. Operating margins of 12.9 percent were 80 basis points lower than the year ago period but 260 basis points higher than the 2009 first quarter.
 
Looking ahead, the Company still believes it has limited visibility as to worldwide end markets. As a result, the Company is limiting its current forecast to the 2009 third quarter. The Company is forecasting third quarter 2009 diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.51. The 2009 third quarter forecast range assumes a total revenue range of -2 percent to +4 percent versus the 2009 second quarter. The Company expects to reinstate full-year guidance when longer-term visibility becomes more reliable.
