Exhibit 99.1
GLENVIEW, ILLINOISJanuary 27, 2010Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported 2009 fourth quarter diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.98, a 66 percent increase compared to the 2008 fourth quarter. The Company continued to see the benefits of ongoing restructuring activities and improvements in discrete end markets in the most recent quarter.  In addition, the Company recorded several discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a favorable German tax settlement and additional foreign tax credits as a result of reorganization.  These tax adjustments had a favorable impact of 37 cents per share in the quarter.  Excluding the impact of the discrete tax adjustments, fourth quarter income would have been 61 cents per share.
Fourth quarter 2009 operating revenues of $3.757 billion were 5.0 percent lower than the year-ago period. However, fourth quarter operating revenues were 5.0 percent higher than the 2009 third quarter mainly due to an increase in automotive OEM builds, a modest improvement in worldwide end markets and the positive impact of currency translation. The Companys base revenues declined 10.0 percent in the 2009 fourth quarter versus the year-ago period, with North American base revenues declining 10.9 percent and international base revenues decreasing 9.0 percent. Acquisitions and currency translation added 1.7 percent and 3.3 percent to revenues, respectively, in the quarter. By comparison, total company base revenues decreased 17.9 percent in the 2009 third quarter versus the 2008 third quarter. Fourth quarter operating margins of 12.7 percent were 120 basis points higher than the year-ago period, with base margins contributing 160 basis points.
Full-year 2009 operating revenues of $13.877 billion were 18.8 percent lower than 2008. Base revenues fell 18.4 percent for the full year, with North American base revenues decreasing 21.6 percent and international base revenues declining 14.9 percent. Acquisitions added 4.2 percent to revenues while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 4.8 percent. Full-year diluted income per share from continuing operations totaled $1.93, a 40 percent decline versus 2008. Full-year operating margins of 10.0 percent were 460 basis points lower than 2008.
The Companys fourth quarter free operating cash flow of $434 million was once again driven by improvement in operating margins and ongoing reductions in working capital. For full-year 2009, free operating cash flow totaled $1.899 billion, representing a free operating cash flow to net income conversion rate of 201 percent.
Given the ongoing modest recovery in many of our worldwide end markets, we are very pleased with the performance of our global businesses and our operating results in the fourth quarter, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David B. Speer. We continued investing in worldwide restructuring projects, incurring $33 million of expense in the quarter and $161 million of restructuring expense for the full year. We believe these restructuring initiatives, coupled with numerous long-term growth investments in our businesses led by our operating managers, position ITW very well for enhanced top line growth and operating margin performance in 2010 and beyond.
Segment highlights for the 2009 fourth quarter include:
*Worldwide revenues for the Transportation segment increased 9.6 percent in the quarter versus the year-ago period. Segment base revenues grew 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the 2008 fourth quarter. By comparison, base revenues declined 7.9 percent in the 2009 third quarter versus the year-ago period. The sequential improvement in base revenues was largely due to increased auto builds both internationally and in North America. European auto builds moved to a robust 5.1 million units in the fourth quarter versus 3.9 million units in the third quarter. And North American auto builds of 2.7 million units in the fourth quarter were 364,000 units higher than the third quarter. Worldwide automotive base revenues grew 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period. By comparison, third quarter worldwide automotive base revenues decreased 9.7 percent compared to the year-earlier period.
