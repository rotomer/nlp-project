Item 2.02.                      Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 20, 2010, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company) announced its 2010 second quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Companys presentation from the second quarter conference call held on July 20, 2010 is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free operating cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Companys operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
     GLENVIEW, ILLINOISJuly 20, 2010Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported 2010 second quarter diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.83, a 131 percent improvement versus diluted income per share of $0.36 in the 2009 second quarter. The growth in earnings was achieved even though the Company experienced a higher than expected tax rate, which had a negative impact of $0.03 per share.  The 2010 second quarter tax rate of 31.6 percent was 260 basis points higher than the rate the Company originally forecasted in April of 2010.
     The Companys second quarter revenues of $4.076 billion were 20.1 percent higher than the year-ago period. Base revenues grew 15.1 percent in the second quarter, with North American base revenues increasing 15.8 percent and international base revenues growing 14.2 percent. Notably, international end markets showed no discernable signs of slowing as the second quarter progressed. Acquisitions and currency translation added 3.0 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, to second quarter revenues.
     Second quarter operating income of $652.7 million was 95 percent higher than the year-ago period. Income from continuing operations totaled $420.8 million, a 135 percent improvement versus the year-earlier period. Second quarter operating margins of 16.0 percent were 610 basis points higher than the year-ago period, with base businesses accounting for 470 basis points of improvement. Restructuring benefits added 160 basis points to second quarter operating margins.
     Our very strong second quarter operating performance was due to a combination of better than expected end market demand as well as contributions from restructuring programs over the past two years,  said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. Notably, end markets associated with the automotive OEM, industrial packaging, welding, electronics and polymers and fluids businesses all showed strength in the quarter. Our second half forecast indicates base revenue growth in a range of 7 percent to 10 percent compared to the 2009 second half.  Acquisition activity continues to show improvement as we closed approximately $280 million in annualized revenues in the first half of the year.
     Segment highlights for the 2010 second quarter include:
     Total worldwide revenues for the Power Systems and Electronics segment grew 24.6 percent in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. Base revenues increased 22.6 percent in the quarter due to strong end market demand associated with both the welding and electronics businesses.  Worldwide welding base revenues grew 13.5 percent in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, with North American welding increasing 20.6 percent. International welding base revenues were flat. The welding base revenue performance represented a significant improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. Driven by ongoing strong consumer electronics demand, the PC board fabrication business grew its base revenues 89.8 percent versus the 2009 second quarter.
     Total worldwide revenues for the Industrial Packaging segment increased 23.5 percent in the second quarter compared to the year-earlier period. Base revenues grew 17.7 percent in the quarter largely as a result of increased demand in key North American industries such as automotive, construction and appliance for plastic and steel strapping consumables. As a result, total North American industrial packaging base revenues grew 22.5 percent in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. Total international industrial packaging base revenues increased 11.9 percent in the second quarter compared to the 2009 second quarter.
     The Company is forecasting third quarter 2010 diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.72 to $0.84. The 2010 third quarter forecast assumes a total revenue growth range of 9 percent to 13 percent. For full-year 2010, the Company is forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $2.82 to $3.08. The 2010 full-year forecast assumes a total revenue growth range of 11 percent to 13 percent. The new full-year midpoint guidance represents an upward adjustment from the Companys prior full-year earnings range of $2.72 to $3.08.  In addition, the Company has raised its forecasted range of annualized acquired revenues to $500 million - $700 million from $300 million - $500 million.
