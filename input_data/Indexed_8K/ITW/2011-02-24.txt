The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings resulted from the Companys appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioners similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties agreed to defer the appeal of that determination until a decision was made on the earlier years.
On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia decided in the Companys favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company expects to record a favorable discrete tax adjustment of $166 million, or 33 cents of diluted income per share from continuing operations, in its 2011 first quarter. The Australian Tax Office has 21 days from the date the Court issued its final orders to appeal the decision.
