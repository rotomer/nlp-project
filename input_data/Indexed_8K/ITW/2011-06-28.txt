Exhibit 99.1
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(June 28, 2011)As previously announced, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) entered into a definitive agreement in April 2011 to sell its finishing group of businesses to Graco Inc. The finishing businesses revenues were approximately $305 million in 2010. Additionally, the Company approved plans to divest a consumer packaging business and an electronics business, which had combined 2010 revenues of approximately $100 million. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified the results of these businesses, as well as two other businesses previously exited, to discontinued operations. The effect of the reclassification is as follows:
 
 
The Company also is announcing that it has completed share repurchase activity of $550 million or 9.7 million shares in the 2011 second quarter. This reduction in shares equates to $0.05 of 2011 full-year earnings.
 
As a result of this reclassification to discontinued operations and share repurchase activity, the Company is now forecasting 2011 second quarter income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.95 to $1.01 and assumes a total revenue growth range of 17 percent to 20 percent.  The new forecasted range compares to a second quarter 2010 adjusted income per share from continuing operations of $0.79.  Excluding the reclassification for discontinued operations and share repurchase, the second quarter 2011 would be in a range of $0.99 to $1.05.  For the full year, the Company is now forecasting income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $4.08 to $4.26 and assumes a total revenue growth range of 16 percent to 18 percent.  The full-year forecast includes the $0.33 per share one-time tax benefit recorded in the 2011 first quarter. The new forecasted range compares to a full-year 2010 adjusted income per share for continuing operations of $2.89. Excluding the reclassification for discontinued operations and share repurchase, the full year 2011 would be in a range of $4.16 to $4.34.
