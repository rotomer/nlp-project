Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 26, 2011, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company) announced its 2011 second quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Companys presentation from the second quarter conference call held on July 26, 2011 is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free operating cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Companys operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
     GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(July 26, 2011)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported second quarter 2011 diluted income per share from continuing operations of $0.96, a 22 percent increase compared to the 2010 second quarter. Excluding the impact of discontinued operations, second quarter 2011 diluted net income per share would have been $0.99.  Total revenues of $4.615 billion increased 17.5 percent versus the year-ago period.  The Companys financial results and forecast reflect the reclassification of certain businesses to discontinued operations as announced on June 28, 2011.
     Second quarter 2011 financial highlights versus the prior-year period included:
- Organic or base revenues grew 6.3 percent, with North American organic revenues increasing 7.4 percent and international organic revenues growing 5.1 percent.
- Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.8 percent and currency translation contributed 6.3 percent to total revenues.
- Operating income of $711.1 million increased 14 percent and income from continuing operations of $483.5 million grew 21 percent. Net income of $498.4 million increased a similar 21 percent.
- While total operating margins of 15.4 percent decreased 50 basis points, base operating margins increased 30 basis points. Acquisitions and restructuring negatively impacted operating margins by 90 basis points.
 - The Company also executed share repurchases of $550 million or 9.7 million shares in the second quarter.
     Operating highlights for the 2011 second quarter compared to the year-ago period included:
      - Total revenues for the Power Systems and Electronics segment increased 18.8 percent. Segment organic revenues grew 11.9 percent largely based on ongoing strength from the welding businesses. The welding groups worldwide organic revenues grew 18.2 percent in the second quarter, with both North American and international organic revenues increasing by double digits.  Both geographies were helped by solid demand from heavy equipment manufacturers.  Organic revenues for the electronics businesses increased 4.1 percent largely due to the PC Board fabrication businesses.  Segment operating margins of 20.6 percent were 50 basis points higher than the year-ago period, with base margins improving 150 basis points.
     - Total revenues for the Industrial Packaging segment grew 20.9 percent. Organic revenues for the segment increased 9.6 percent due to contributions from all major business groups. The North American and international businesses grew organic revenues 11.2 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. North American strappings organic revenues grew 12.9 percent while international strappings organic revenues increased 6.2 percent.  The equipment portion of the strapping business helped drive sales in the quarter. Segment operating margins of 10.9 percent were 20 basis points higher than the year-earlier period.
     While our second quarter performance reflected solid demand from a number of worldwide end markets, our 17.5 percent total revenue growth was slightly below our original expectations, said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. Both our total revenue and organic revenue growth rates in the second quarter were approximately 100 basis points lower than forecasted in April.  We also anticipate similar moderating demand levels in the second half of 2011. As a result, we have modestly adjusted our third quarter revenue assumptions as well as our full-year earnings forecast. Nonetheless, we still believe overall end markets continue to be in a long-term recovery mode.
     The Company is forecasting 2011 third quarter diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.95 to $1.03.  The midpoint of this earnings range represents 24 percent growth versus the third quarter of 2010.  The third quarter forecast assumes a total revenue growth range of 15 percent to 18 percent. For the 2011 full year, the Company is forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $4.05 to $4.21 and assumes a total revenue growth range of 16 percent to 18 percent. The full-year forecast includes the $0.33 per share one-time tax benefit recorded in the 2011 first quarter. Excluding the one-time tax gain, the midpoint of the full-year earnings would be $3.80 and would represent a 32 percent increase compared to the year-ago period.
