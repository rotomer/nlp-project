Item 1.01.                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
The information set forth below under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
On August 24, 2011, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several initial purchasers, entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) in connection with the issuance of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 3.375% notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 4.875% notes due 2041 (the 2041 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Notes).  The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the issuance of the Notes, are expected to be consummated on August 31, 2011.
The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1986, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (collectively, the Indenture), and an Officers Certificate containing the terms of the Notes.  The Indenture, together with the Officers Certificate, sets forth the terms of the Notes and the obligations of the Company thereunder.  Following is a brief description of the material terms of the Notes, the Indenture and the Officers Certificate, which summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture, which is an exhibit hereto and to the Officers Certificate, which will be filed by the Company following the issuance of the Notes.
 
The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equal in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The 2021 Notes will mature on September 15, 2021 and the 2041 Notes will mature on September 15, 2041.  Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2012.  At any time that is prior to June 15, 2021 or March 15, 2041, the Company will be able to redeem the 2021 Notes or the 2041 Notes, respectively, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  At any time on or after June 15, 2021 or March 15, 2041, the Company will be able to redeem the 2021 Notes or the 2041 Notes, respectively, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of redemption.
 
 
 
The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Companys and certain of its subsidiaries ability to incur liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and engage in merger or similar transactions.  These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions described in the Indenture.  The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency.  Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any affected series may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, including additional interest, on all the Notes of that series to be due and payable.
The offer and sale of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and the Notes were sold by the Company in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

This Current Report is being filed in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes and to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the documents and instruments attached hereto as exhibits.
