Item 1.01.       Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
The information set forth below under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
 
As previously announced, on August 24, 2011, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several initial purchasers, entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) in connection with the issuance of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 3.375% notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 4.875% notes due 2041 (the 2041 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Notes).  The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the issuance of the Notes, were consummated on August 31, 2011.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1986, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (collectively, the Indenture), and an Officers Certificate containing the terms of the Notes.  The Indenture, together with the Officers Certificate, sets forth the terms of the Notes and the obligations of the Company thereunder.  Following is a brief description of the material terms of the Notes, the Indenture and the Officers Certificate, which summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Officers Certificate and the Indenture, which are exhibits hereto.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equal in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The 2021 Notes will mature on September 15, 2021 and the 2041 Notes will mature on September 15, 2041.  Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2012.  At any time that is prior to June 15, 2021 or March 15, 2041, the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes or the 2041 Notes, respectively, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  At any time on or after June 15, 2021 or March 15, 2041, the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes or the 2041 Notes, respectively, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of redemption.
The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Companys and certain of its subsidiaries ability to incur liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and engage in merger or similar transactions.  These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions described in the Indenture.  The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency.  Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any affected series may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, including additional interest, on all the Notes of that series to be due and payable.
 
 
 
The offer and sale of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and the Notes were sold by the Company in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
Also on August 31, 2011, the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes, entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) regarding the Notes pursuant to which the Company agreed to cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable after the date it has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the purpose of exchanging the Notes for notes with substantially identical terms that may be freely traded.  In addition, under certain circumstances, the Registration Rights Agreement requires the Company to file a shelf registration statement that would permit some or all the Notes to be offered to the public.  If the exchange offer is not consummated, or the shelf registration statement has not become effective, within the time period set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company will be obligated to pay a special interest premium in the amount of 50 basis points.  Also, if the Company fails to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective or usable for resales for the period required under the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company will be obligated to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the Notes in the amount of 25 basis points for the first 90 days during which the failure to comply continues, increasing to 50 basis points thereafter.

3.375% Note Due 2021
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of the Securities of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), designated as its 3.375% Notes due 2021 (individually, a Security and collectively, the Securities), issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1986 and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990 (the Indenture), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the Trustee).  The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and in the Officers Certificate dated August 31, 2011 (the Officers Certificate) establishing certain terms of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the TIA), and those set forth in this Security.  This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, the Officers Certificate and the TIA for a statement of all such terms.  All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Officers Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them therein.  The Securities are unsecured general obligations of the Company.
The Securities are initially limited to the aggregate principal amount of Three Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($350,000,000), as specified in the Officers Certificate.  The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the existing Holders of Securities, issue additional Securities with the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities, except for the issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest thereon.  Additional Securities so issued will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the Securities.
Under certain circumstances, additional interest may be payable as and to the extent provided in the Issue Date Registration Rights Agreement or any other Registration Rights Agreement applicable to Additional Notes.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, relating to the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the provisions contained in the Indenture.  The Indenture provides that, prior to the declaration of maturity of the Securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default under the Indenture relating to the Securities and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
This Security may be redeemed at the Companys option, in whole or in part, on any date that is prior to June 15, 2021 at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed on the date of redemption or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.  At any time on or after June 15, 2021, the Company may also redeem some or all of this Security at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a date of redemption will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered holder hereof as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date according to this Security and the Indenture.  The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are obtained, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
Primary Treasury Dealer means a primary United States government securities dealer in the United States.
Reference Treasury Dealer means (i) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) (in any case not less than two) selected by the Company.
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Notice of a redemption will be mailed to holders of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.  On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price.  If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Securities of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Securities may not be redeemed before September 15, 2021 (herein referred to as the Stated Maturity) and shall not be entitled to any sinking, purchase or analogous fund, nor shall the Company be obligated to redeem or purchase the Securities at the option of any Holder thereof.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures which, if they pertain specifically to the Securities, may add any provisions to or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities or of any supplemental indenture relating to the Securities or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the Stated Maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the currency in which any Security is payable, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture relating to the Securities, without the consent of the Holders of all Securities then outstanding.
The Company may terminate all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture as it relates to the Securities, with certain limited exceptions described in the Indenture, by (i) irrevocably depositing in trust with the Trustee money or Government Obligations (or any combination thereof) sufficient to pay principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities at Stated Maturity and (ii) complying with certain other conditions specified in the Indenture.  Alternatively, the Company may, upon the making of such deposit and the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, omit to comply with its covenants in the Indenture relating to creation of secured indebtedness (Section 4.05), sale and lease-back transactions (Section 4.06), and transactions involving a merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation or a sale, conveyance or lease of the property of the Company substantially as an entirety to any other corporation or entity (Article Eleven), and such omission shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable as registered Securities without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000.  At the office or agency to be maintained by the Company in Chicago, Illinois, New York, New York or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Securities may be exchanged by the Holder thereof without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in respect thereof, for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of Securities of other authorized denominations.
Subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers Certificate and herein, this Security is transferable and the registration of the transfer hereof may be effected by the registered Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon due presentment for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in Chicago, Illinois, New York, New York or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, but only in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers Certificate and herein, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto.  Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by any person), for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a condition of and part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

This Security may be redeemed at the Companys option, in whole or in part, on any date that is prior to March 15, 2041 at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed on the date of redemption or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 25 basis points, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.  At any time on or after March 15, 2041, the Company may also redeem some or all of this Security at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a date of redemption will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered holder hereof as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date according to this Security and the Indenture.  The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are obtained, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
Primary Treasury Dealer means a primary United States government securities dealer in the United States.
Reference Treasury Dealer means (i) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) (in any case not less than two) selected by the Company.
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Notice of a redemption will be mailed to holders of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.  On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price.  If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Securities of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Securities may not be redeemed before September 15, 2041 (herein referred to as the Stated Maturity) and shall not be entitled to any sinking, purchase or analogous fund, nor shall the Company be obligated to redeem or purchase the Securities at the option of any Holder thereof.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures which, if they pertain specifically to the Securities, may add any provisions to or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities or of any supplemental indenture relating to the Securities or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the Stated Maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the currency in which any Security is payable, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture relating to the Securities, without the consent of the Holders of all Securities then outstanding.
The Company may terminate all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture as it relates to the Securities, with certain limited exceptions described in the Indenture, by (i) irrevocably depositing in trust with the Trustee money or Government Obligations (or any combination thereof) sufficient to pay principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities at Stated Maturity and (ii) complying with certain other conditions specified in the Indenture.  Alternatively, the Company may, upon the making of such deposit and the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, omit to comply with its covenants in the Indenture relating to creation of secured indebtedness (Section 4.05), sale and lease-back transactions (Section 4.06), and transactions involving a merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation or a sale, conveyance or lease of the property of the Company substantially as an entirety to any other corporation or entity (Article Eleven), and such omission shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable as registered Securities without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000.  At the office or agency to be maintained by the Company in Chicago, Illinois, New York, New York or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Securities may be exchanged by the Holder thereof without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in respect thereof, for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of Securities of other authorized denominations.
Subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers Certificate and herein, this Security is transferable and the registration of the transfer hereof may be effected by the registered Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon due presentment for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in Chicago, Illinois, New York, New York or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, but only in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers Certificate and herein, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto.  Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by any person), for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a condition of and part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Indenture and this Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.

Issuer Information
(b)           Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any duly documented losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.
 
 
(c)           If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the ) shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the ) in writing; the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 in such proceeding that the Indemnifying Person may designate and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and reasonable and documented expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by the Initial Purchasers, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than forty five (45) calendar days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or was threatened to be made a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

(d)           If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)           The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section (5) are several and not joint.
pro

(f)           The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g)           The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
