Exhibit 99.1

Exhibit 99.2
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer; or (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the RSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (3) withholding in shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the RSUs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company and/or the Employer will satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding in shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the RSUs, unless such withholding method is not permissible under applicable law, in which case you may elect to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by one of the other methods identified above.
To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer; or (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon vesting/settlement of the PRSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (3) withholding in shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the PRSUs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company and/or the Employer will satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding in shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the PRSUs, unless such withholding method is not permissible under applicable law, in which case you may elect to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by one of the other methods identified above.
