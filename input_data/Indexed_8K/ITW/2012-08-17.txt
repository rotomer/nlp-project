Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As of August 15, 2012, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the ) and its newly-formed subsidiaries, ITW DS Investments Inc. () and Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (), entered into an Investment Agreement (the ) with CD&R Wimbledon Holdings III, L.P. (), a newly-formed investment vehicle owned by affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, related to the acquisition by Investor of a majority interest in the Companys Decorative Surfaces business. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company will contribute the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces business to Wilsonart in exchange for payments totaling $1.05 billion and a continued equity interest in the business.  Investor will contribute $395 million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly-issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units issued by Wilsonart (the ).  The Preferred Units to be sold to Investor will initially represent approximately 51% of the total outstanding equity (on an as-converted basis) of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement (the ).  The Company currently indirectly owns all of the common units of Wilsonart, a limited liability holding company formed to hold the Companys Decorative Surfaces business following the Closing.  After Closing, the Company will continue to indirectly own common units of Wilsonart, which will represent approximately 49% of Wilsonarts total outstanding equity (on an as-converted basis). The Company will then cease to consolidate the results of the Decorative Surfaces business within its financial statements and will report its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting.

Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, it is anticipated that Wilsonart (or a subsidiary of Wilsonart) will incur new third-party indebtedness of approximately $725 million through a combination of borrowings from term loans under a new secured credit agreement and the issuance of new senior unsecured notes (or bridge financing). The secured credit agreement will also contain a $175 million revolving credit facility to fund future cash needs of Wilsonart.  The proceeds paid to the Company at Closing are subject to customary adjustments between Seller and Wilsonart based upon the amount of cash, third-party indebtedness and net operating assets of Wilsonart and its subsidiaries at Closing relative to a target amount.
 
Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012, and is subject to certain customary conditions, including: (i) there not having occurred a Material Adverse Effect on the Decorative Surfaces business since August 15, 2012; (ii) all applicable waiting periods and clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and foreign antitrust laws shall have unconditionally expired, been terminated or obtained; and (iii) completion of a marketing period in connection with the new third-party financing arranged by Investor for the transaction.  Approval of the Companys stockholders is not required in connection with the Investment.
 
The Preferred Units to be purchased by Investor pursuant to the Investment Agreement will rank senior to Wilsonarts common units as to dividends and liquidation preference.  The Preferred Units will have an initial liquidation preference of $395 million and entitle the holder to a dividend at a rate of 10.00% per annum on the liquidation preference, compounding quarterly and payable in cash or in additional Preferred Units at the option of Wilsonart.  In the event the amount of  dividends paid in additional Units exceeds certain thresholds, the dividends may accrue at a rate of 12.00% per annum on the liquidation preference, compounding quarterly.  Dividend payments will be eliminated for any prospective period if Wilsonart achieves certain earnings thresholds for three consecutive twelve-month periods.  Each Preferred Unit generally votes on an as-converted basis, and is convertible at any time.  The holders of Preferred Units have certain special consent rights and the Preferred Units may not be redeemed without holder consent.
 
The Investment Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, Seller and Investor.  The Investment Agreement contains customary termination rights for both the Company and Investor and provides that, upon the termination of the Investment Agreement under specific circumstances relating to a breach of the Investment Agreement by Investor or where the new third-party debt financing to be incurred in connection with the transaction is unavailable at the closing of the investment, Investor will be obligated to pay the Company a termination fee of $63 million.  Each of the Company, Seller, Investor and Wilsonart has agreed to provide indemnification for certain breaches of the Investment Agreement and in respect of specified liabilities.
 
Under the Investment Agreement, the Company has agreed not to compete with Wilsonart and its business following the Closing until two years after Seller owns less than 50% of the equity owned by Seller as of the Closing.  The non-competition provision is subject to certain customary exceptions.
 
In connection with the Investment, at Closing, Investor and Seller will enter into a limited liability company agreement, pursuant to which Seller will be entitled to appoint three of Wilsonarts eight board members.  Four of the remaining directors will be designated by Investor, with the chief executive officer of Wilsonart serving as the eighth director.  Prior to an initial public offering, so long as either the Seller or Investor and their respective affiliates own at least 25% of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart, the consent of such party will be needed for certain significant company actions, including liquidation and dissolution, issuance of certain equity, incurrence of significant indebtedness and the acquisition or disposal of a material amount of assets (subject to specified dollar thresholds).  The limited liability company agreement and related agreements will provide customary registration rights to each of Seller and Investor and will include certain restrictions on the ability of each of Seller and Investor to transfer their respective equity interests in Wilsonart; however, neither Seller nor Investor will be bound by any minimum holding period for the equity of Wilsonart.  So long as Investor and its affiliates hold more than 50% of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart, if they propose to sell all of their equity of Wilsonart to an unaffiliated third party, they may require the participation of all other equity holders in such transaction provided that the proceeds of such transaction are shared by all equity holders (including Investor and its affiliates) pro rata, on an as-converted basis.  Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if either Investor or Seller proposes to sell all or part of its equity units in Wilsonart, the other party will have a right of first refusal to purchase such units or to participate in such sale.  Seller and Investor also have preemptive rights to purchase their pro rata portion of any new units proposed to be issued by Wilsonart in the future.
 
Under limited circumstances, after the earlier of the third anniversary of the closing of the Investment or such time as the Preferred Units cease to accrue dividends, either Seller or Investor, so long as they and their permitted affiliate transferees own at least 25% of the outstanding equity of Wilsonart, shall have the right to cause the initial public offering () of Wilsonart.  In the event that either Seller or any of its permitted transferees initiates an IPO, Investor has a right to purchase the units held by Seller or its transferees, as applicable, and its affiliates for a purchase price based on a valuation of such units undertaken by three independent investment banks applying certain agreed upon valuation principles.

Investor agrees that the Preferred Units may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and such Laws.  Investor is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Preferred Units for an indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and (either alone or together with its representatives) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

Exhibit 99.1
 
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS(August 16, 2012)Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to divest a 51 percent stake in its Decorative Surfaces segment, consisting of Wilsonart and related international businesses, to a fund managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R).  Through a combination of CD&Rs equity investment of $395 million and borrowing by the new company, ITW will receive cash proceeds of approximately $1.05 billion at closing and will retain a 49 percent equity interest in the business. ITW intends to utilize a majority of after-tax transaction proceeds to repurchase shares to help offset associated earnings dilution.
The Wilsonart, Resopal and Arborite brands were acquired in 1999 by ITW as part of the Premark International transaction. In 2011, the Decorative Surfaces segment had revenues of $1.1 billion and operating margins of 12 percent. Located in North America, Europe and Asia, the Decorative Surfaces segment manufactures and distributes a variety of laminate and work surface products for the construction market including commercial, residential and renovation applications. Products include decorative laminate, solid surface, adhesives and custom edging. The business will become a new, independent company operating as Wilsonart International Holdings, LLC (Wilsonart).
 The Decorative Surfaces segment has a variety of premium brands and is a valuable asset. The transaction with CD&R creates an opportunity for the business to fully leverage the depth and breadth of its decorative surfacing products and technologies as well as their unique design and full-service capabilities, said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. For ITW, the transaction will allow us to focus more resources on our core platforms as well as retain a share in the value of the business as global construction end markets improve over the coming years.
We believe this transaction creates a very strong foundation for Wilsonart to deliver continued industry-leading performance and are pleased to have ITW as our partner as we work with the Wilsonart management team to further build the value of the business, said CD&R Partner Nathan K. Sleeper.
Paul Pressler, a CD&R operating partner, will assume the role of interim chief executive officer of Wilsonart upon the close of the transaction.
Wilsonart is extremely well-positioned for future growth, said Mr. Pressler. We look forward to working with the management team to expand globally, invest in industry-leading innovation, service and distribution capabilities, and provide rewarding career opportunities for employees.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, and will be subject to regulatory reviews. The Decorative Surfaces segment results will continue to be reported in ITWs operating income for the third quarter of 2012. Based on the expected completion date, the company is maintaining its third quarter 2012 income per share from continuing operations guidance range of $1.03 to $1.11. Upon completion of the transaction, ITWs ownership interest in the decorative surfaces businesses will be reported using the equity method of accounting and ITW will adjust its full-year forecast accordingly.
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding income per share from continuing operations and use of proceeds from the announced transaction.  These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.  Such factors include failure to obtain regulatory approvals or to satisfy other conditions of the transaction, unanticipated expenses related to the transaction, unexpected issues that may result from ITWs continued ownership of a minority interest in the transaction, and other factors contained in ITWs 2011 Form 10-K.
Celebrating its 100-year anniversary in 2012, ITW is a Fortune 150 global diversified industrial manufacturer of value-added consumables and specialty equipment with related service businesses. The Company focuses on profitable growth and strong returns across worldwide platforms and businesses. The businesses serve local customers and markets around the globe, with a significant presence in developed as well as emerging markets. ITWs revenues totaled $17.8 billion in 2011, with more than half of the revenues generated outside of the United States.
