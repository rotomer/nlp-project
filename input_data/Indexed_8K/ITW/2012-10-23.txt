Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 23, 2012, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company) announced its 2012 third quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Companys presentation from the third quarter conference call held on October 23, 2012 is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free operating cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and in the conference call presentation furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A reconciliation of ROIC is included in the conference call presentation furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. A reconciliation of total debt to EBITDA is included in the conference call presentation furnished as Exhibit 99.2.

ITW's 2012 Third Quarter Diluted Income Per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.12 Increases 12 Percent Versus Prior-Year Period; Excluding Impact of Divestiture Gains, EPS Totals $1.09; Operating Margins of 16.9 Percent Improve 130 Basis Points; Company Repurchases $416 Million of Shares in Third Quarter and $1.4 Billion of Shares Year to Date
GLENVIEW, ILLINOIS-October 23, 2012-Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported third quarter 2012 diluted income per share from continuing operations of $1.12, a 12 percent increase versus the 2011 third quarter. Excluding the impact of divestiture gains in the third quarter, diluted income per share from continuing operations totaled $1.09. While third quarter total revenues and organic revenues were lower than anticipated due to the negative impact of currency translation and slowing demand in a variety of international end markets, operating margins of 16.9 percent outperformed expectations and reflected improvement across all segments.
Third quarter 2012 financial and operating highlights versus the prior-year period included:
*Total revenues of $4.501 billion decreased 1.7 percent. Notably, currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 4.1 percent largely based on a weaker Euro versus last year. Organic or base revenues grew 0.9 percent, with North American organic revenues increasing 3.9 percent and international organic revenues declining 2.7 percent. European and Asia Pacific organic revenues decreased 3.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.4 percent to revenues.
*Operating income of $763 million increased 6.8 percent. Operating margins of 16.9 percent improved 130 basis points due to favorable raw material price/cost trends as well as effective management of overhead costs within the businesses.
*Total revenues for the Power Systems and Electronics segment increased 4.6 percent. Segment organic revenues grew 4.5 percent due to contributions from both the electronics and welding businesses. Total organic revenues for electronics grew 10.5 percent due to strong contributions from the electronic assembly businesses. Organic revenues for worldwide welding increased 1.9 percent, with North American welding growing 4.6 percent and international welding decreasing 5.6 percent. Segment operating margins of 22.0 percent improved 220 basis points.
*The Company returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via share repurchases of $416 million and dividends paid of $169 million.
Even with end markets slowing in a number of international geographies, we were pleased by the consistent level of end market demand in North America, said E. Scott Santi, president and acting chief executive officer. From a profitability standpoint, we continued to focus on our differentiated 80/20 business process and, as a result, we produced very strong operating margin gains in the quarter. We also continued to return significant levels of cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
Looking ahead, the Company believes international end markets will continue to be sluggish and the impact of currency translation will be modestly negative in the 2012 fourth quarter. As a result, we now expect full-year total revenue growth to be in a range of 0 percent to 1 percent. Full-year diluted income per share from continuing operations is forecasted to be in a range of $4.06 to $4.14. For the 2012 fourth quarter, the Company is forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $0.86 to $0.94 and total revenues to decline in a range of 1 percent to 4 percent. The Company expects the previously announced Decorative Surfaces divestiture transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Both the full year and fourth quarter forecasts exclude two months of operating contributions from the Decorative Surfaces segment, gains and expenses related to the transaction, as well as the impact from the 49 percent ongoing equity interest in the new Decorative Surfaces entity.
