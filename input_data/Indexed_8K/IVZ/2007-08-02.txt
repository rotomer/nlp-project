During the quarter, we completed our evaluation of the assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the purchase of WL Ross & Co., which closed in October 2006. As a result of this evaluation, $100.0 million initially included in goodwill has been reclassified to intangible assets associated with post acquisition employment arrangements, to be amortized over a period of approximately five years. Non-cash amortization of $15.0 million has been recorded during the quarter (representing three cumulative quarters of amortization).
Capital Management
Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of June 30, 2007 was $330.8 million compared to $515.1 million as of March 31, 2007 and $483.1 million as of December 31, 2006.
On January 15, 2007, the company repaid $300.0 million of 5.9% senior notes. On April 17, 2007, the company issued $300.0 million five-year 5.625% senior notes. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to quarter end, Standard & Poor's affirmed our BBB+ debt rating and removed their negative outlook.
Since the Board's approval of a stock repurchase plan in June, the company has purchased 2.8 million ordinary shares at a cost of $36.8 million. These purchases are reflected as an increase in Treasury shares on the balance sheet at June 30, 2007.
The Board has declared an interim dividend of $0.082 per share, a 6.5% increase over the prior year (2006: $0.077 per share). The ex-dividend date for the dividend will be September 19, 2007. The interim dividend will be paid on October 25, 2007, to shareholders on the register on September 21, 2007, the record date, which will also be the date upon which the foreign exchange rate will be established for payment to shareholders who receive their dividends in sterling.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT TO INVESCO PLC
Introduction
We have been instructed by the company to review the financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2007 which comprises consolidated financial statements including the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 8. We have read the other information contained in the interim report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial information.
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4 "Review of interim financial information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority which require that the accounting policies and presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where any changes, and the reasons for them, are disclosed.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4 "Review of interim financial information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review consists principally of making enquiries of group management and applying analytical procedures to the financial information and underlying financial data, and based thereon, assessing whether the accounting policies and presentation have been consistently applied, unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and transactions. It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the financial information.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial information as presented for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
