Regulatory Developments
This earnings release includes financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, with reconciliation to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). Prior to July 2007, Invesco was a "foreign private issuer" for purposes of the filing and disclosure requirements under the U.S. federal securities laws. As a foreign private issuer, Invesco prepared its financial statements in accordance with IFRS, with an annual reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. Since Invesco no longer qualifies as a foreign private issuer, Invesco is required to present its financial statements in SEC periodic reports in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Like this earnings release, the financial statements to be included in Invesco's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 will be prepared in accordance with IFRS, consistent with Invesco's past periodic reports, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2006, and will include a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. The SEC staff has informed Invesco that it will not object to this presentation for purposes of the Form 10-Q. Invesco will begin presenting its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Also as a result of no longer qualifying as a foreign private issuer, Invesco is now subject to more extensive SEC filing requirements in the U.S. in addition to the existing requirements of the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom. Invesco, as previously announced, therefore intends to move its primary listing from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange and relocate its domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda. An Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders will convene on November 14, 2007, to allow shareholders to approve the change in domicile and the move of the primary listing of Invesco shares from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange. The company estimates that the one-time costs associated with this transition will be approximately $12 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures, industry or market conditions, assets under management, acquisition activities and the effect of completed acquisitions, debt levels and the ability to obtain additional financing or make payments on our debt, regulatory developments, demand for and pricing of our products and other aspects of our business or general economic conditions. In addition, when used in this release, words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "projects" and future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "could," "should," and "would" and any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although we make these statements based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from our expectations. We caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following is a summary of material adjustments to equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, which would be required if U.S. GAAP had been applied instead of IFRS.
13
 
a: Retirement benefit plans
Under IFRS, amounts recognized as a net liability for defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical obligations include the actuarially-determined defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of plan assets, less the unrecognized net actuarial losses, plus the credit to prior service costs recognized during the year. Under U.S. GAAP, pursuant to the company's adoption of FAS 158 in 2006, amounts recognized as a net liability on the balance sheet include only the actuarially-determined defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets (the funded status of the plans). Under U.S. GAAP, the unrecognized net actuarial losses and the credit to prior service costs are recorded directly to other comprehensive income. Additionally, upon transition to IFRS at January 1, 2004, the company's cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses were reset to zero and accordingly are building up again only from the IFRS transition date. The combination of these items results in a greater IFRS balance sheet provision for defined benefit pension and post retirement medical plans than under U.S. GAAP. Since the cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses for the company are greater under U.S. GAAP than under IFRS, this results in greater amortization costs under U.S. GAAP.
b: Redundancy and Reorganizations
Certain amounts provided relating to redundancy and reorganization initiatives under IFRS must be expensed over the period of the related initiative under U.S. GAAP.
c: Acquisition Accounting
The company transitioned from U.K. GAAP to IFRS at January 1, 2004. Prior to this date, the U.K. GAAP treatment of goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1998 was to eliminate it directly against reserves. These amounts remain in reserves under IFRS. Goodwill arising in 1998 and after was capitalized and amortized through the transition date to IFRS.
Under U.S. GAAP, the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets ceased at January 1, 2002, and the balances are carried forward at cost less provision for impairment in value. There is therefore a two-year period (2002 and 2003) under which the goodwill balances were amortized, while the U.S. GAAP balances were not.
Contingent consideration payable related to acquisitions is not recorded under U.S. GAAP until the applicable conditions have been satisfied. Discounting charges related to the contingent consideration that are recorded in interest expense are similarly not recorded under U.S. GAAP.
14
 
d: Taxation
Tax expense under U.S. GAAP has been adjusted to reflect the redundancy and reorganization differences (Note b), the additional retirement benefit plan cost (Note a), and the reduction in interest expense (Note c).
Deferred tax assets have been reduced to reflect the remaining redundancy and reorganization differences (Note b), the cumulative decrease in the retirement benefit plan cost (Note a), the cumulative decrease in interest expense (Note c), and share based payments excluding the mark-to-market tax valuation applied under IFRS.
The implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007 increased the company's tax contingencies liability and reduced opening U.S. GAAP retained earnings by $12.6 million. There were no material increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits during the nine month period ended September 30, 2007. Additional interest in the amount of $2.4 million has been included in the taxation net income reconciling item from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, resulting in a $15.0 million decrease from IFRS shareholders' equity to arrive at U.S. GAAP shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2007. Based on information currently available, the company does not anticipate any material changes in the liability within the next twelve months.
e. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
Compliance with FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51," (FIN 46R) would result in a number of investment funds being consolidated into the company's income statement and balance sheet under U.S. GAAP that are not consolidated under IFRS. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the main impact of consolidating these investment funds would be to increase investment income by $158.5 million (nine months ended September 30, 2006: $111.6 million) offset by a similar increase in profit attributable to minority interests. Consolidation also increases our investments as at September 30, 2007 by $1,395.6 million (December 31, 2006: $1,461.3 million) again offset by a similar increase in equity attributable to minority interests. Consolidation of these investment funds would not have a material impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent as reported in the income statement nor the equity attributable to equity holders of the parent reported in the balance sheet.
f. Interim Dividend
Interim dividends are recognized when paid under IFRS but are accrued when declared under U.S. GAAP.
