Companys predecessor, Invesco PLC, for
the
fiscal years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2006
were audited
by
Ernst & Young LLP, a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of England and Wales and member of the global Ernst & Young organization operating in the United Kingdom
("Ernst & Young LLP (UK)).
The
independent registered public accounting firm has changed
from Ernst & Young LLP (UK) to Ernst & Young LLP (US) as a result of the

resigned

on the financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the same periods and subsequent interim periods, there were no disagreements between the Company and Ernst & Young LLP (UK) on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP (UK), would have been referred to in their reports on the financial statements of the Company for such periods.
The Company has requested Ernst & Young LLP (UK) to furnish it a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of that letter, dated
April
4, 2008,
is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 8-K/A (Amendment No. 1).
