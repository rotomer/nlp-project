Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $470.3 billion. Average assets under management during the first quarter of 2008 decreased by 6.5% to $476.6 billion, from $509.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline in average assets under management was largely driven by the downturn in global equity markets during the first quarter of 2008. As a result of lower equity assets under management (as a percentage of total assets under management), coupled with the growth in our money market assets under management, we would expect to report a net revenue yield (including performance fees) for the first quarter of 2008, slightly lower than that reported for the first quarter of 2007.
