$155.2
million
in the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39

Work over the last two years to transform Invesco into an integrated worldwide investment manager with distinctive investment capabilities supported by a global operating platform continues to strengthen our competitive position, said Invesco President and CEO Martin L. Flanagan. While the market environment remains volatile, confidence in our companys ability to build
long-term

share
repurchase
program of up to $1.5 billion.
 
Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at March 31, 2008 were $470.3 billion (December 31, 2007: $500.1 billion; March 31, 2007: $471.2 billion). Average AUM during the first quarter
of 2008
were $476.6 billion, compared to $509.9 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2007. The decline in average AUM was largely driven by the downturn in global equity markets during the first quarter of 2008. Average AUM during the first quarter of 2007 were $466.9
billion.
Total
net
in
flows were $1.2
billion for the first quarter

2007: net inflows of $3.5 billion) offset by long-term net outflows of $8.4
billion (fourth quarter
2007: net outflows of $5.0 billion). Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.

General and administrative costs
decreased
34.2% to $68.4
million for the

%
for the
first
quarter of 2008
(fourth

34.5
%) as a result of
decreasing

This release may include statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the United States securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures,
 industry or market conditions, assets under management, acquisition activities and the effect of completed acquisitions, debt levels and the ability to obtain additional financing or make payments on our debt, regulatory developments, demand for and pricing of our products and other aspects of our business or general economic conditions.
In addition, when used in this
release, words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "projects" and future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "could," "should," and "would" and any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.   Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. In connection with any forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the areas of risk described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K
and
any
subsequent Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You may obtain these reports from the SECs Web site at
www.sec.gov
.  We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any of the information in this or any other public disclosure if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The following is a reconciliation of operating revenues, operating income
 and
operating margin
on a U.S. GAAP basis to
net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin.
*     
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues.
**     
Net operating margin is equal
to net operating income divided by net revenues.
(1)     
Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are additional meaningful measures to evaluate our operating performance. The most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues, operating income and operating margin. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory
expenses
from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution, service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties, which essentially are a share of the related revenues.  Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution
expenses,
from
joint venture
investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating
income
in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide
useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its growing
joint venture investment
to the operations of the business.
Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
