Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at June 30, 2008 were $461.3 billion (March 31, 2008: $470.3 billion). Average AUM during the second quarter of 2008 were $482.6 billion, compared to $476.6 billion for the first quarter of 2008. The decline in quarter end AUM was largely driven by the downturn in global equity markets during the second quarter of 2008.
 
Total net outflows were $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2008, as compared to total net inflows of $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2008. These net outflows comprised $6.2 billion in long-term net outflows (first quarter 2008: net outflows of $8.4 billion) offset by money market net inflows of $4.7 billion (first quarter 2008: net inflows of $9.6 billion). Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.

Employee compensation costs increased 3.7% to $282.9 million for the second quarter of 2008 from $272.8 million for the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to annual salary increases and amortization of share-based compensation, both effective March 1. Employee compensation costs decreased 2.1% from $288.9 million for the second quarter of 2007, driven by a decrease in accruals for variable compensation.

This release, and comments made by management in the associated conference call today, may include statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the United States securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, earnings, liquidity, cash flow and capital expenditures, industry or market conditions, assets under management, acquisition activities and the effect of completed acquisitions, debt levels and the ability to obtain additional financing or make payments on our debt, regulatory developments, demand for and pricing of our products and other aspects of our business or general economic conditions. In addition, when used in this  release, words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "projects" and future or conditional verbs such as "will," "may," "could," "should," and "would" and any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. In connection with any forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the areas of risk described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You may obtain these reports from the SECs Web site at
www.sec.gov
.  We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any of the information in this or any other public disclosure if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

through to external parties, which essentially are a share of the related revenues.  Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture investment to the operations of the business. Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
