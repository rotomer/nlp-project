Operating expenses for the fourth quarter included $21.1 million ($14.2 million after tax) in costs related to savings initiatives of $16.0 million (third quarter: $0 million) and charges of $5.1 million related to vacating leased property (third quarter: credit of $3.3 million, $2.4 credit after tax). These items combined to reduce net operating margin by 4.4% (third quarter: increase by 0.5%). Non-operating items for the fourth quarter included write-downs of $14.2 million ($13.8 million after tax) related to the companys investments in certain collateralized loan obligations and other seed money (third quarter: $9.4 million, $9.2 million after tax) and $7.7 million ($5.5 million after tax) related to unrealized foreign exchange losses (third quarter: $2.1 million, $1.5 million after tax). These charges had a combined effect of reducing our diluted earnings per share by $0.09 (third quarter: $0.02).
 
Assuming a continuation of year-end 2008 market and foreign exchange levels, Invesco expects to decrease 2009 total operating expenses by 17.6% to $2,110 million from $2,560 million in 2008.
 
Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2008 were $357.2 billion (September 30, 2008: $409.6 billion). The decline in AUM during the fourth quarter was due to reduced market values, the impact of less favorable foreign exchange rates, and total net outflows (long-term net flows plus net flows in institutional money market funds). Average AUM during the fourth quarter were $356.8 billion, compared to $448.3 billion for the third quarter.
 
Market declines led to a $33.7 billion reduction in AUM during the fourth quarter compared to a reduction of $29.6 billion in the third quarter. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $16.7 billion reduction in AUM during the fourth quarter compared to a reduction of $11.0 billion in the third quarter.

The level of total net outflows improved by $9.1 billion to $2.0 billion for the fourth quarter from $11.1 billion in the third quarter. These net outflows comprised $4.4 billion in long-term net outflows (third quarter: net outflows of $3.0 billion) offset by institutional money market net inflows of $2.4 billion (third quarter: net outflows of $8.1 billion).  Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
 
Earnings Summary
 
Operating revenues decreased 23.3% to $634.4 million in the fourth quarter (from $827.2 million in the third quarter), consistent with the decline in average AUM during the period. Operating revenues for the fourth quarter included performance fees of $23.8 million generated mainly in our quantitative strategies business and in the UK (third quarter: $18.1 million).Net revenues were $481.9 million for the fourth quarter (third quarter: $618.0 million). See the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information on page 8 for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
 
Employee compensation costs decreased 10.6% to $236.0 million for the fourth quarter from $264.1 million for the third quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of reductions in share-based compensation and pension costs, offset by bonus costs associated with improved investment performance and performance fee revenues. In addition, compensation costs include $12.1 million of the $16.0 million related to savings initiatives incurred during the fourth quarter.
 
Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs decreased 26.4% to $162.6 million for the fourth quarter from $220.9 million for the third quarter, consistent with the decline in investment management and service and distribution fees.
 
Marketing expenses decreased by 10.1% to $31.3 million for the fourth quarter from $34.8 million for the third quarter due to lower marketing support payments.
 
Property, office and technology costs increased 14.9% to $58.0 million for the fourth quarter from $50.5 million for the third quarter primarily due to costs related to vacating leased property totaling $5.1 million. The third quarter included a reduction in property, office and technology costs of $3.3 million due to a downward adjustment in rent costs for sublet office property.
 
General and administrative costs increased 0.5% to $62.0 million for the fourth quarter from $61.7 million for the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter costs are $3.9 million of the $16.0 million related to savings initiatives.
 
The effective tax rate, after minority interests, increased to 52.9% for the fourth quarter from 27.2% for the third quarter. The increase is largely the result of the investment write-downs that occurred in zero or low-tax rate jurisdictions, which provided no associated tax benefits. The third quarter included the release of $9.9 million of our FIN 48 income tax reserve.

Schedule of Non-GAAP Information
(Unaudited, in millions)
 
The following is a reconciliation of operating revenues, operating income and operating margin on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin.

from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution, service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties, which essentially are a share of the related revenues.  Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
