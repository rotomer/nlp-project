Atlanta, April 23, 2009
--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) reported net income of $30.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 (quarter ended December 31, 2008: $31.9 million). Diluted earnings per share were $0.08 for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2008: $0.08). Operating income was $61.8 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2008: $84.5 million).
 
In spite of volatile markets, strong growth in our exchange-traded funds, U.K. business and cash management helped Invesco achieve positive long-term and total flows during the quarter, said Martin L. Flanagan, president and CEO. We remain focused on executing our multi-year plan and leveraging our strong investment performance to improve our competitive position within the investment management industry.
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at March 31, 2009, were $348.2 billion (December 31, 2008: $357.2 billion). The decline in AUM during the first quarter was due to reduced market values and the impact of less favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by net inflows in long-term AUM and institutional money market funds. Average AUM during the first quarter were $351.0 billion, compared to $356.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Market declines led to a $16.3 billion reduction in AUM during the first quarter, compared to a reduction of $33.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $2.0 billion reduction in AUM during the first quarter, compared to a reduction of $16.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Total net inflows were $9.3 billion for the first quarter, compared to $2.0 billion net outflows in the fourth quarter of 2008. Long-term net inflows were $0.7 billion for the first quarter, compared to $4.4 billion net outflows in the fourth quarter of 2008. Institutional money market net inflows were $8.6 billion for the first quarter, compared to $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
 
Earnings Summary
 
Operating revenues decreased 13.5% to $548.6 million in the first quarter from $634.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, as market values of equity AUM, which generally have higher fee rates than other asset classes, declined. Additionally, performance fees in the first quarter were $10.9 million, a decrease of 54.2% (fourth quarter 2008: $23.8 million). The first quarter performance fees were generated primarily in the U.K. Other revenues in the first quarter decreased 60.3% to $12.2 million from $30.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting primarily from a reduction in transaction commissions within our private equity business. Net revenues were $410.0 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2008: $481.9 million). See the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information on page 6 for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
 
Operating expenses decreased 11.5% to $486.8 million in the first quarter from $549.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in operating expenses in the first quarter, including transition expenses and an insurance recovery, was consistent with our previously announced expense guidance.
 
Employee compensation expenses were $235.8 million in the first quarter, compared to $236.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. First-quarter compensation expenses included an increase in payroll taxes of $8.8 million, resulting from the seasonal timing of these taxes in the U.S. First-quarter compensation expenses also included $13.0 million related to savings initiatives (fourth quarter 2008: $12.1 million).

Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased 8.9% to $148.2 million in the first quarter from $162.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, consistent with the decline in investment management and service and distribution fees.
 
Marketing expenses decreased by 14.1% to $26.9 million in the first quarter from $31.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to lower advertising and sales-related travel.
 
Property, office and technology expenses decreased 20.9% to $45.9 million in the first quarter from $58.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to effective cost containment measures together with the cost incurred related to vacating leased property of $5.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
General and administrative expenses decreased 51.6% to $30.0 million in the first quarter from $62.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The first-quarter expenses included a $9.5 million insurance recovery related to the market-timing regulatory settlement. Included in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $3.9 million in expenses related to savings initiatives.
 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates declined to $2.5 million in the first quarter from $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to net losses of $3.9 million in our partnership investments (fourth quarter 2008: net gains of $3.3 million).
 
The net loss of $4.2 million in other gains and losses in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2008: net loss of $21.9 million) included $6.6 million in unrealized investment write-downs (fourth quarter 2008: $14.2 million) partly offset by realized investment gains and foreign exchange gains totalling $2.4 million (fourth quarter 2008: foreign exchange losses of $7.7 million).
 
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 39.8% for the first quarter from 52.9% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease was largely the result of fewer investment write-downs in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 that occurred in zero or low-tax rate jurisdictions, which provided no associated tax benefits.
 
Capital Management
 
During the first quarter, the company repaid a net $4.5 million on its credit facility (fourth quarter 2008: net repayments of $160.0 million), resulting in a $7.5 million balance at March 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: $12.0 million). The company had cash and cash equivalents of $333.1 million at March 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: $585.2 million).
 
On April 22, 2009, the company declared a first-quarter cash dividend of 10.25 cents per share to holders of our common stock, a 2.5% increase over the fourth quarter 2008 dividend of 10 cents per share. The dividend is payable on June 3, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2009.
