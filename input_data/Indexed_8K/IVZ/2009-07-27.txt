Atlanta, July 27, 2009
--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) reported net income of $75.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 (quarter ended March 31, 2009: $30.7 million). Diluted earnings per share were $0.18 for the second quarter (first quarter 2009: $0.08). Operating income was $110.4 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2009: $61.8 million).
 
During the second quarter, Invescos continued focus on disciplined management helped strengthen long-term flows, operating income and margins in an improving market environment, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and CEO. "We demonstrated our financial flexibility by raising $460 million of new equity, which will help further enhance our competitive position and support our continued growth over the long term."
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at June 30, 2009 were $388.7 billion (March 31, 2009: $348.2 billion). The increase in AUM during the second quarter was due to increased market values, a favorable movement in foreign exchange rates, and net inflows in long-term and institutional money market funds. Average AUM during the second quarter were $376.5 billion, compared to $351.0 billion for the first quarter.
 
Market gains led to a $24.8 billion increase in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a reduction of $16.3 billion in the first quarter. Foreign exchange rate movements led to $11.0 billion increase in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a reduction of $2.0 billion in the first quarter.
 
Total net inflows were $4.7 billion for the second quarter, compared to $9.3 billion net inflows in the first quarter. Long-term net inflows were $3.0 billion for the second quarter, compared to $0.7 billion net inflows in the first quarter. Institutional money market net inflows were $1.7 billion for the second quarter, compared to $8.6 billion for the first quarter. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
 
Earnings Summary
 
Operating revenues increased by $76.5 million (13.9%) to $625.1 million in the second quarter, from $548.6 million in the first quarter, as a result of favorable changes in the mix of asset classes, an overall increase in average AUM, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes ($25.8 million). Performance fees in the second quarter were $8.0 million, compared to $10.9 million in the first quarter. Other revenues in the second quarter grew by $2.9 million (23.8%) to $15.1 million, from $12.2 million in the first quarter, due to increased transaction commissions within our private equity group. Net revenues increased by $59.9 million (14.6%) to $469.9 million in the second quarter (first quarter: $410.0 million). See the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information on page 8 for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
 
Operating expenses increased by $27.9 million (5.7%) to $514.7 million in the second quarter, from $486.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher market values and foreign exchange rate changes. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased operating expenses by $18.8 million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The company continued to apply cost containment measures consistent with our previously announced expense guidance.
 
Employee compensation expenses decreased by $6.8 million (2.9%) to $229.0 million in the second quarter, from $235.8 million in the first quarter. Second-quarter compensation expenses included a reduction of $8.4 million in U.S. payroll taxes compared to the first quarter, resulting from the seasonal timing of these taxes. Second quarter compensation expenses also included $4.3 million related to savings initiatives (first quarter: $13.0 million). These expense reductions were offset by

foreign exchange rate changes that increased compensation expenses by $6.4 million, together with increased sales commissions and other variable compensation.
 
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $18.1 million (12.2%) to $166.3 million in the second quarter, from $148.2 million in the first quarter, consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fees.
 
Marketing expenses decreased by $3.0 million (11.2%) to $23.9 million in the second quarter, from $26.9 million in the first quarter, due to lower levels of advertising.
 
Property, office and technology expenses increased by $2.7 million (5.9%) to $48.6 million in the second quarter, from $45.9 million in the first quarter, primarily due to $1.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes.
 
General and administrative expenses increased by $16.9 million (56.3%) to $46.9 million in the second quarter, from $30.0 million in the first quarter. Of this increase $1.3 million was due to foreign exchange rate changes. Included in the first quarter was a $9.5 million insurance recovery. The remaining increase is primarily due to seasonally higher fund expenses and additional legal expenses related to product launches.
 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $7.5 million in the second quarter, from $2.5 million in the first quarter. In the second quarter performance in our Great Wall joint venture improved while the first quarter included a loss of $3.9 million in our partnership investments.
 
The net gains of $10.0 million in other gains and losses in the second quarter (first quarter: net loss of $4.2 million) includes a gain on the completion of our recent debt tender offer together with foreign exchange gains.
 
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 32.2% for the second quarter, from 39.8% for the first quarter. The first quarter tax rate was unusually high due to investment write-downs that occurred in zero or low-tax rate jurisdictions, which provided no associated tax benefit.

On May 26, 2009, the company issued 32.9 million new common shares, generating gross proceeds of $460.5 million.The company raised these funds for general corporate purposes, including new product initiatives, potential acquisitions and repayment of long-term indebtedness.

There was no balance on the new facility as at June 30, 2009.
