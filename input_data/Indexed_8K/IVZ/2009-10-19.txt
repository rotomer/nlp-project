                                                                                                               1555 Peachtree Street, N.E.
                                                                                                               Atlanta, GA 30309

We are excited to expand the depth and breadth of our investment strategies, which will enable us to offer our clients a truly comprehensive range of investment capabilities through an expanded set of investment vehicles, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and CEO. This combination of talented teams from both organizations will enhance Invescos ability to deliver meaningful solutions to our retail and institutional clients around the world, and better position Invesco for long-term success.
 
This complementary combination fully meets Invescos previously stated acquisition criteria, and we believe strongly benefits our clients and shareholders, said Loren Starr, chief financial officer of Invesco. We expect that this transaction will be approximately 11% accretive in the first 12 months after close and have an IRR of approximately 30%.
 
At closing, Invesco will have approximately 700 investment professionals, with a meaningful presence in all major markets around the world.
 
Terms of the transaction
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Invesco would acquire Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments in exchange for $1.5 billion, comprising $500 million in cash and 44.1 million shares representing $1 billion in Invesco equity.
 
The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in mid-2010, subject to customary regulatory, client and fund shareholder approvals.
