Atlanta, October 20, 2009
--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) reported net income of $105.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 (the quarter ended June 30, 2009: $75.7 million). Diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the third quarter (second quarter 2009: $0.18). Operating income was $151.6 million for the third quarter (second quarter 2009: $110.4 million).
 
As the markets continue to recover, the success of Invescos disciplined response to last falls challenging markets is demonstrated by our higher operating income and solid margin improvement, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and CEO. This strong competitive position, built on the progress we have made over the last four years in unlocking the tremendous potential of our global organization, set the foundation for yesterdays exciting announcement that Invesco will acquire Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at September 30, 2009 were $416.9 billion (June 30, 2009: $388.7 billion). The increase in AUM during the third quarter was largely due to increased market values, together with the impact of slightly more favorable foreign exchange rates. Average AUM during the third quarter were $406.9 billion, compared to $376.5 billion for the second quarter.
 
Market increases led to a $27.4 billion increase in AUM during the third quarter, compared to a $24.8 billion increase in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $0.8 billion increase in AUM during the third quarter, compared to an increase of $11.0 billion in the second quarter.
 
Long-term net inflows were $2.6 billion for the third quarter, compared to $3.0 billion net inflows in the second quarter. Institutional money market net outflows were $2.6 billion for the third quarter, compared to $1.7 billion net inflows for the second quarter. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
 
Earnings Summary
 
Operating revenues increased by $80.7 million (12.9%) to $705.8 in the third quarter, from $625.1 million in the second quarter, as a result of an overall increase in average AUM, favorable changes in the mix of asset classes, and the impact of average foreign exchange rate changes. The changes in foreign exchange rates added $13.3 million to operating revenues compared to the second quarter. Performance fees in the third quarter were $4.3 million, compared to $8.0 million in the second quarter. Other revenues in the third quarter grew by $4.3 million (28.5%) to $19.4 million, from $15.1 million in the second quarter, including increased transaction commissions within our real estate group. Net revenues increased by $64.9 million (13.8%) to $534.8 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $469.9 million). See the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information on page 7 for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
 
Operating expenses increased by $39.5 million (7.7%) to $554.2 million in the third quarter, from $514.7 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher market values on distribution related expenses and foreign exchange rate changes. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased operating expenses by $9.4 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
 
Employee compensation expenses increased by $9.9 million (4.3%) to $238.9 million in the third quarter, from $229.0 million in the second quarter.

Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $17.2 million (10.3%) to $183.5 million in the third quarter, from $166.3 million in the second quarter, moving in line with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fees.
 
Marketing expenses increased by $3.8 million (15.9%) to $27.7 million in the third quarter, from $23.9 million in the second quarter, mainly due to higher marketing support payments.

General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million (12.4%) to $41.1 million in the third quarter, from $46.9 million in the second quarter. The second quarter included seasonally higher fund expenses and additional legal expenses related to product launches.

The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 29.3% for the third quarter from 32.2% for the second quarter principally due to the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions.
