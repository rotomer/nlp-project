Our commitment to investment excellence continued to yield strong, long-term investment performance for our clients and contributed to another quarter of positive fund flows, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and CEO. Since our announcement in October, weve made steady progress toward closing our acquisition of Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments, which will enable us to expand the depth and breadth of investment capabilities we deliver to clients.
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
Assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2009 were $423.1 billion (September 30, 2009: $416.9 billion). The increase during the fourth quarter was largely due to increased market values and net inflows in long-term AUM, partially offset by net outflows in money market funds. Average AUM during the fourth quarter were $420.3 billion, compared to $406.9 billion for the third quarter.
Market increases led to a $10.2 billion increase in AUM during the fourth quarter, compared to a $27.4 billion increase in the third quarter. Long-term net inflows were $2.6 billion for both the fourth quarter and the third quarter. Institutional money market net outflows were $7.7 billion for the fourth quarter, compared to $2.6 billion net outflows for the third quarter. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
Earnings Summary
Operating revenues increased by $42.0 million (6.0%) to $747.8 in the fourth quarter, from $705.8 million in the third quarter, as a result of an overall increase in average AUM together with a favorable change in the mix of asset classes.

Operating expenses increased by $33.1 million (6.0%) to $587.3 million in the fourth quarter, from $554.2 million in the third quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher market values on distribution-related expenses and $9.8 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the fourth quarter related to the acquisition of the Morgan Stanley retail asset management business (third quarter: $1.0 million).
