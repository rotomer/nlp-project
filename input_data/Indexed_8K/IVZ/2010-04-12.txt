Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $419.6 billion.  Average assets under management during the first quarter of 2010 were $417.6 billion, a 0.6% decrease from the fourth quarter 2009.  Long-term net inflows continued to improve quarter over quarter, which were offset by outflows from institutional money markets as well as by the significant depreciation of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar.  In addition, the total net revenue yield was slightly lower than that reported for the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of lower performance fees and transaction fees, as well as the day count impact in the first quarter of 2010.
