Atlanta, April 28, 2010
 
Invescos ability to provide strong, long-term investment performance to our clients contributed to the continued trend of positive long-term net flows for the firm, said Martin L. Flanagan, president and chief executive officer.  We are making steady progress toward closing our combination with Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments, which we anticipate will take place on  June 1.  We have been working hard to ensure that clients and shareholders will begin receiving the benefits of the combination from Day 1 of the close.  These will include an expanded, comprehensive array of investment capabilities and a significantly enhanced U.S. market presence.

Assets Under Management
 
Assets under management (AUM) at March 31, 2010, were $419.6 billion (December 31, 2009: $423.1 billion). The decline in AUM during the first quarter was due to the impact of less favorable foreign exchange rates and net outflows in institutional money market funds, partially offset by net inflows in long-term AUM and market gains. Average AUM during the first quarter was $417.6 billion, compared to $420.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $4.4 billion reduction in AUM, compared to a $1.1 billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. Institutional money market net outflows were $10.6 billion for the first quarter and $7.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. Long-term net inflows were $3.7 billion for the first quarter, compared to $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. Market gains led to a $7.8 billion increase in AUM during the first quarter, compared to a $10.2 billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
 
Earnings Summary
 
As previously indicated, the company has taken steps to provide investors with greater insight into our business, for example by disclosing AUM on a monthly basis. With the adoption of FASB Statement No. 167 on January 1, 2010, which resulted in the consolidation of certain collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and the pending acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, for which the company is incurring transition and integration charges, the company believes that the additional disclosure of adjusted non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our press release on March 12, 2010, will provide further transparency into the business and allow more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. The company is therefore presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this relea se.
 
U.S. GAAP Earnings
 
Operating revenues decreased 3.8% to $719.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, from $747.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating expenses declined by 0.9% to $582.2 million in the first quarter, from $587.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating expenses included $17.2 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the first quarter related to the pending acquisition of the Morgan Stanley retail asset management business (fourth quarter 2009: $9.8 million). As previously announced, these costs in aggregate are currently expected to be less than $175 million and will be realized in 2010 and 2011. The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, increased to 34.5% for the first quarter from 30.3% for the fourth quarter of 2009primarily due to changes in forecasted profit mix and foreign exchange rates.
 
 
The adoption of FASB Statement No. 167 during the first quarter resulted in the consolidation of certain CLOs with total assets of $5.8 billion.
The consolidation of our investment products, including the CLOs, reduced first quarter operating revenues by $10.4 million, reflecting the elimination of investment management fees, increased operating expenses by $3.2 million, and added interest income of $52.5 million, interest expense of $20.8 million and net investment gains of $103.1 million to the U.S. GAAP results. The impact of these adjustments was offset by a $119.4 million gain attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities. In accordance with the standard, comparative periods have not been restated for the adoption of FASB Statement No. 167.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Earnings
 
This section discusses the companys first quarter 2010 and fourth quarter 2009 non-GAAP financial results. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to the non-GAAP items on pages 7 to 11 of this release.
 
Net revenues decreased 3.8% to $544.4 million in the first quarter, from $565.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenues were reduced by $7.0 million due to exchange rate changes.
 
Investment management fees, as adjusted, decreased 1.7% to $617.6 million in the first quarter from $628.4 million in the fourth quarter with lower average AUM. The foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced investment management fees by $10.0 million as the British Pound weakened against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by a stronger Canadian Dollar. In addition, since retail management fees are accrued on a daily basis, the two fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 also reduced revenues.
 
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, increased $1.1 million to $112.5 million in the first quarter, from $111.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter 2009 figures were adversely impacted by having reached certain full year fund expense recovery limits. Performance fees in the first quarter were $1.4 million, a decrease of 79.4% (fourth quarter 2009: $6.8 million). Other revenues, as adjusted, in the first quarter decreased 36.9% to $11.3 million, from $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting primarily from lower transaction commissions within our real estate business. Net revenue is calculated after deducting third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, of $198.4 million in the first quarter, compared to $198.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Total operating expenses, as adjusted, decreased 4.4% to $361.4 million in the first quarter from $377.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating expenses, as adjusted, declined by $5.6 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
 
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, decreased by $10.5 million (4.3%) to $234.1 million in the first quarter, from $244.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2009 included a $4.1 million increase in pension costs related to annual actuarial valuation updates and a $4.3 million increase in payroll taxes associated with the vesting of share-based awards. Foreign exchange rate changes reduced first quarter compensation expenses by $3.5 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Seasonally higher U.S. payroll taxes in the first quarter were offset by lower variable compensation expenses.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Marketing expenses, as adjusted, decreased by 8.1% to $28.4 million in the first quarter, from $30.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, mainly due to a reduction in sponsorship and client events, and foreign exchange rate changes.
 
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, decreased 2.5% to $54.1 million in the first quarter, from $55.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, largely driven by foreign exchange rate changes.
 
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, decreased 4.5% to $44.8 million in the first quarter, from $46.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2009 had included higher seasonal fund related expenses and professional expenses due to new product introductions.
 
The effective tax rate increased to 28.7% for the first quarter, from 26.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to changes in forecasted profit mix and foreign exchange rates.
 
Capital Management
 
Cash and cash equivalents were $597.0 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $762.0 million at December 31, 2009. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents reflects the timing of staff annual bonus payments. Long-term debt remains unchanged from December 31, 2009, at $745.7 million as of March 31, 2010, with the credit facility remaining undrawn.
 
On April 27, 2010, the company declared a first-quarter cash dividend of 11 cents per share to holders of our common shares. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 24, 2010.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 7 to 9. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release issued by the company on March 12, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
 
 
Acquisition related adjustments include the transaction and integration charges of $17.2 million for the first quarter 2010 (fourth quarter 2009: $9.8 million, first quarter 2009: $0.0 million). Taxation on this amount, calculated at the applicable tax rate for the tax deductible portion of the charges, is $1.9 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $1.7 million, first quarter 2009: $0.0 million) giving a net adjustment of $15.3 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $8.1 million, first quarter 2009: $0.0 million).
 
Adjustments also include intangible amortization of $3.1 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $3.2 million; first quarter 2009: $3.1 million) and the amortization of prepaid compensation of $5.0 million (same for all quarters presented) related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. Taxation of $0.1 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $0.1 million; first quarter 2009: $0.0 million ) is recorded on a small portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit, giving a net adjustment of $3.0 million for the first quarter  (fourth quarter 2009: $3.1 million; first quarter 2009: $3.1 million).
 
Adjustments for deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles that are amortized for tax purposes were $3.6 million in the first quarter (same in all quarters presented).
 
 
Management fees earned by the company from consolidated investment products were $10.6 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $2.1 million, first quarter 2009: $3.0 million) while other revenues of $0.2 million were recorded by the consolidated investment products in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2009: $0.2 million, first quarter 2009: $1.4 million). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back while the other revenues are excluded. Similarly the consolidated investment products expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an increase of $1.6 million in net income at tributable to common shareholders in our first quarter U.S. GAAP earnings. The above adjustments remove this impact.

This adjustment relates to non-equity deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. These investments are held to economically hedge the exposure to market movements. The appreciation of the compensation liability was $1.9 million in the first quarter with an investment gain of $2.4 million on the assets held to economically hedge the compensation liability. This additional compensation expense and the investment gain are adjusted in arriving at the Non-GAAP information and, net of applicable taxation of $0.2 million, result in a net income adjustment of $0.3 million.
 
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted cash operating margin is equal to adjusted cash operating income divided by net revenues.
 
 
Adjusted cash EPS is equal to adjusted cash net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (as used for diluted EPS).
