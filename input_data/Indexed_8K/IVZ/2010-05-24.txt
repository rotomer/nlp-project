Credit Agreement
 
On May 24, 2010, Invesco Ltd. (the Company), its direct subsidiary Invesco Holding Company Limited (IHCL), its indirect subsidiary IVZ, Inc. (IVZ; together with IHCL, collectively, the Borrowers) entered into a three-year unsecured $1.25 billion revolving credit facility agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon, SunTrust Bank, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, HSBC Bank USA, National Association and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agents.  The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and cer tain of its subsidiaries.
 
The Credit Agreement replaces an existing $500 million Credit Agreement, dated as of June 9, 2009 (the Prior Credit Agreement) entered into by the Company and IVZ.  The Prior Credit Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 9, 2012 but was terminated concurrently with entry into the new credit facility.  Neither the Company nor IVZ incurred any early termination fees in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.  At the time of termination, there were no loans outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement.
 
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are repayable at maturity on May 23, 2013.  The proceeds of the Credit Agreement are to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful purposes, to finance acquisitions and to repurchase equity and debt of the Company and its subsidiaries on certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) LIBOR for specified interest periods or (ii) a floating base rate (based upon the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%), plus, in either case, an applicable margin determined with reference to IVZ's or IHCLs credit ratings and specified credit default spreads.  Based on current credit ratings of IHCL and such credit default spreads, the applicable margin for LIBOR-based loans would be 1.075% and for base rate loans would be 0.075%.  In addition, IVZ is required to pay the lenders a facility fee on the aggregate commitments of the lenders (whether or not used) at a rate per annum which is based on IVZ's or IHCLs credit ratings.  ; Based on current credit ratings of IHCL, the annual facility fee will be equal to 0.30%.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants on the Company and its subsidiaries.  Restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement include prohibitions on creating, incurring or assuming liens; entering into merger arrangements; selling, leasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of assets; making a material change in the nature of the business; making a significant accounting policy change in certain situations; entering into transactions with affiliates; and incurring indebtedness through the non-guarantor subsidiaries.  Many of these restrictions are subject, however, to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions.  Financial covenants under the Credit Agreement include (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not greater than 3.25 :1.00 through December 31, 2011 and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter and (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration or increase in amounts due, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control, certain judgments, ERISA matters, cross-default to other debt agreements, governmental action prohibiting or restricting the Company or its subsidiaries in a manner that has a material adverse effect and failure of certain guaranty obligations.
 
 
 
 
 
The lenders (and their respective affiliates) may have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, leasing, foreign exchange, trust or other advisory services to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  These parties may have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation for these services.

The Credit Agreement will be so filed in order to provide investors with information regarding its terms.
