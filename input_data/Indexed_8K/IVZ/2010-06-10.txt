May assets under management do not include the assets of Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business as the close occurred on June 1, 2010.
Atlanta, June 9, 2010 ---
Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $430.0 billion, a decrease of 5.9% month over month. Given the increased volatility in financial markets, we experienced long-term net outflows largely in the lower fee ETF and Passive category.  Further, during the month depreciating global currencies against the US Dollar contributed approximately $6 billion to the overall decline in assets under management month over month.
Preliminary average assets under management Q2 quarter to date were $448.6 billion.
(a) Preliminary  subject to adjustment.
(b) Preliminary - ending money market AUM includes $65.4 billion in institutional money market AUM and $3.8 billion in retail money market AUM.
