June assets under management include assets acquired from Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business.  As of June 1, 2010, the closing date of the transaction, $114.6 billion in AUM was acquired.
Atlanta, July 12, 2010 ---
Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $557.7 billion, an increase of 24.1% month over month. Continued declines in financial markets during the month of June reduced assets but were partially offset by favorable movements in exchange rates (which added $2.2 billion of AUM during the month).  Net flows during the month were strongly positive and driven largely by the addition of a lower fee institutional passive mandate in Japan, related to the recent acquisition.  Preliminary average assets under management Q2 quarter to date were $480.5 billion, up 6.9% when compared to Q1 2010 average assets of $449.6 billion.
 
(a) Preliminary  subject to adjustment.
(b) Preliminary - ending money market AUM includes $68.1 billion in institutional money market AUM and $4.4 billion in retail money market AUM.
