--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 for the second quarter of 2010 (first quarter 2010: $0.27). Adjusted net income was $125.4 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $120.0 million). On a U.S. GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.09 for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $0.21), and net income attributable to common shareholders was $40.8 million (first quarter 2010: $95.0 million). The results for the second quarter of 2010 include one month of activity for the acquired Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, which closed on June 1, 2010 (the acquired business). On a U.S. GAAP basis, second quarter earnings includes $79.3 million of transaction and integration charges ( first quarter 2010: $17.2 million) related to the acquired business.
Atlanta, July 27, 2010
The successful June 1 close of Invescos acquisition of Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments, marks a key milestone for the long-term success of our company by expanding the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities and significant resources we will bring to the marketplace for the benefit of our clients, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and chief executive officer. In spite of volatile markets during the quarter, investment performance remains strong as we work to deliver the tremendous value of our new combination to our clients around the world.
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
Total assets under management (AUM) at June 30, 2010, were $557.7 billion (March 31, 2010: $457.7 billion), an increase of $100.0 billion. The acquired business added $114.6 billion of AUM on June 1, 2010. Long-term net inflows were $13.9 billion for the second quarter, compared to $3.6 billion for the first quarter of 2010, and included net long-term inflows of ETF, UIT and Passive AUM of $14.7 billion and other net long-term outflows of $0.8 billion. The passive AUM net inflows included a $15.8 billion institutional passive mandate sourced in Japan, a direct consequence, post-closing, of the acquired business.
Market gains and losses led to a $24.2 billion reduction in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a $9.7 billion increase in the first quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $3.4 billion reduction in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a $4.5 billion reduction in the first quarter of 2010. Institutional money market net outflows were $0.9 billion for the second quarter compared to $10.6 billion for the first quarter of 2010.
Average AUM during the second quarter was $480.5 billion, compared to $449.6 billion for the first quarter of 2010. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our press release on March 12, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Prior to this release, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share were described as "adjusted cash operating income," "adjusted cash operating margin," "adjusted cash net income," and "adjusted cash earnings per share", respectively. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting. Effective June 30, 2010, the company has removed "c ash" from the names of these measures to emphasize that these measures are performance measures and not liquidity measures.
U.S. GAAP Earnings
Operating revenues increased 9.4% to $787.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, from $719.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. Operating expenses increased by 22.9% to $715.6 million in the second quarter, from $582.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Operating expenses included $79.3 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the second quarter related to the acquired business (first quarter: $17.2 million). General and administrative expenses in the second quarter included $8.9 million representing fund reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations ($6.0 million net of tax and reducing diluted EPS by $0.01).
 
 
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, increased to 47.4% for the second quarter from 34.5% for the first quarter primarily due to the increase in non-deductible transaction and integration charges related to the acquired business.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the companys second quarter 2010 and first quarter 2010 non-GAAP financial results. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to the non-GAAP items on pages 8 to 10 of this release.
The results for the second quarter include the results of the acquired business from the closing date of June 1, 2010. The following table provides an analysis of the estimated impact of the acquired business on the second quarter operating results.
The integration of the acquired business into the existing Invesco business is now largely complete, and as a result, management does not expect to be able to provide similarly segregated information for future periods.
Net revenues increased by $44.6 million (8.2%) to $589.0 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $544.4 million in the first quarter. The acquired business added $48.0 million to net revenues in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes reduced second quarter net revenues by $5.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2010.

Investment management fees, as adjusted, increased by $35.4 million (5.7%) to $653.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, from $617.6 million in the first quarter. The acquired business contributed an increase of $36.3 million.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, increased $26.9 million (23.9%) to $139.4 million in the second quarter, from $112.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, with the acquired business accounting for $25.2 million of the increase. Performance fees in the second quarter were $3.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter. Other revenues, as adjusted, in the second quarter increased by $5.1 million (45.1%) to $16.4 million, from $11.3 million in the first quarter, with the acquired business contributing $5.5 million to the increase.
Net revenue is calculated after deducting third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, of $223.3 million in the second quarter, compared to $198.4 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase of $24.9 million includes $19.0 million from the acquired business together with additional distribution expenses from new product launches and growth in average AUM outside the U.S.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted, increased by $38.9 million (10.8%) to $400.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $361.4 million in the first quarter. The acquired business added $29.4 million to operating expenses, as adjusted, while foreign exchange rate changes reduced operating expenses, as adjusted, by $3.9 million when compared to the first quarter.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, increased by $26.0 million (11.1%) to $260.1 million in the second quarter, from $234.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. 580 new staff joined the company on June 1, 2010, associated with the acquired business and their expenses are included for one month of the quarter. The acquired business accounted for $16.2 million of the quarter on quarter increase in employee compensation expenses, as adjusted. Share-based and deferred cash compensation expenses increased by $6.0 million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to the full quarter additional expense impact of new share and deferred awards issued at the end of February 2010. The second quarter also included severance costs of $4.8 million and an increase in staff bonus expense, partly offset by lower payroll taxes, when compared to the first quarter.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted, increased by $7.1 million (25.0%) to $35.5 million in the second quarter, from $28.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, with the acquired business adding $5.9 million of expense.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, increased $2.3 million (4.3%) to $56.4 million in the second quarter, from $54.1 million in the first quarter, largely driven by the additional office space associated with the acquired business which contributed $3.0 million of additional expense in the second quarter.

General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, increased $3.5 million (7.8%) to $48.3 million in the second quarter, from $44.8 million in the first quarter with the acquired business adding $4.3 million to this expense line.
The effective tax rate increased to 29.3% for the second quarter, from 28.7% for the first quarter primarily due to changes in forecasted profit mix and foreign exchange rates.
Capital Management
On May 24, 2010, the company entered into a three-year unsecured $1.25 billion revolving credit facility to replace the previously undrawn $500.0 million facility held since June 9, 2009.
The closing of the Morgan Stanley retail asset management acquisition on June 1, 2010, resulted in the payments of cash consideration of $770.0 million and the issuance of 30.9 million new common shares and common share equivalents. The acquired business had cash and cash equivalent balances of $57.8 million on June 1, 2010.
Cash and cash equivalents were $555.6 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $597.0 million at March 31, 2010. Long-term debt was $1,395.7 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $745.7 million at March 31, 2010, resulting from a $650.0 million draw from the credit facility.
Today the company is declaring a second-quarter cash dividend of 11 cents per share to holders of our common shares and common share equivalents. The dividend is payable on September 9, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2010.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 8 through 10. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release issued by the company on March 12, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
The company presents the following non-GAAP measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted earnings per share). Prior to June 30, 2010, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share were described as "adjusted cash operating income," "adjusted cash operating margin," "adjusted cash net income," and "adjusted cash earnings per share", respectively. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting. Effective June 3 0, 2010, the company removed "cash" from the names of these measures to emphasize that these measures are performance measures and not liquidity measures.
 
Acquisition related adjustments include transaction and integration charges of $79.3 million for the second quarter 2010 (first quarter 2010: $17.2 million, second quarter 2009: none). Taxation on this amount, calculated at the applicable tax rates for the tax deductible portion of the charges, is $14.8 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $1.9 million, second quarter 2009: none) giving a net adjustment of $64.5 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $15.3 million, second quarter 2009: none). This equates to $0.14 of EPS in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $0.03, second quarter 2009: none)
Transaction and integration charges incurred during the second quarter include $18.5 million of staff costs (first quarter 2010: $0.7 million, second quarter 2009: none), including $14.5 million of severance costs (first quarter 2010 and second quarter 2009: none); $6.1 million for the proxy solicitation of fund investors to approve a change in fund advisor (first quarter 2010: $10.2 million, second quarter 2009: none), $27.5 million for transition of the Van Kampen funds to Invescos platform and governance structure (first quarter 2010 and second quarter 2009: none), $4.7 million related to office space including onerous lease charges associated with vacating office space in Houston as we amalgamate operations (first quarter 2010: $0.8 million, second quarter 2009: none), $5.4 million of sales and marketing costs as we print re-br anded fund prospectuses (first quarter 2010: $0.1 million, second quarter 2009: none), $12.8 million of professional services, principally legal, consultancy and insurance (first quarter 2010: $4.6 million, second quarter 2009: none), and $4.3 million in technology contractor and travel costs (first quarter 2010: $0.8 million, second quarter: none). As previously announced, these costs in aggregate are currently expected to be less than $175 million and include $10.8 million incurred in 2009 with the remainder being incurred in 2010 and 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11
 
 
 
Acquisition related adjustments also include intangible amortization of $5.2 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $3.1 million; second quarter 2009: $3.1 million) and the amortization of prepaid compensation of $5.0 million (same for all quarters presented) related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. Taxation of $0.6 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $0.1 million, second quarter 2009: $0.1 million) is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit, giving a net adjustment of $4.6 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $3.0 million, second quarter 2009: $3.0 million).
Adjustments for deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles that are amortized for tax purposes were $4.2 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010 and second quarter 2009: $3.6 million).
Management fees earned by the company from consolidated investment products were $12.3 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $10.6 million, second quarter 2009: $1.0 million) while other revenues of $0.0 million were recorded by the consolidated investment products in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $0.2 million, second quarter 2009: $0.8 million). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back while the other revenues are excluded. Similarly, the consolidated investment products expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. Interest income of consolidated investment products was $53.1 million in the second quart er (first quarter 2010: $52.5 million, second quarter 2009: none), interest expense was $25.6 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $20.8 million, second quarter 2009: none) and net investment gains were $187.2 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $103.1 million gains, second quarter 2009: $48.4 million losses). The impact of these adjustments was offset by a $197.3 million gain attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities (first quarter 2010: $119.4 million gain, second quarter 2009: $47.7 million loss). The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an increase of $2.2 million in net income attributable to common shareholders in our second quarter U.S. GAAP earnings (first quarter 2010: $1.6 million increase, second quarter 2009: no impact). The above adjustments remove this impact.
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated from January 1, 2010, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 167 Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) and in accordance with the standard, 2009 comparative periods have not been restated.

This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. These investments are held to economically hedge the exposure to market movements. The depreciation of the compensation liability was $2.1 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $1.9 million appreciation) with an investment loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: $2.4 million gain) on the assets held to economically hedge the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment gains and losses are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of applicable taxation of $1.2 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2010: benefit of $0.2 million), result in a net income addition of $2.5 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2010: deduction of $0.3 million) .
4.      Other Reconciling Items
Included within general and administrative expenses is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The companys income tax provision includes tax benefits of $2.9 million relating to this charge. The net of tax charge of $6.0 million is equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.01. Due to the unique character and magnitude of this charge, its impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (as used for diluted EPS).

These products previously were not included in the company's reported AUM, because the company does not receive investment management fees from these assets. These assets are marketed as Invesco products, and to include them as part of our AUM better represents the full size and capabilities of Invesco. Additionally, the company may receive performance, service, distribution, or transaction revenues from these assets. The inclusion of these assets as AUM changed previously reported AUM, gross and net revenue calculations on AUM and gross and net revenue calculations on AUM before performance fees. Additionally, as a result of the acquired business, the company now manages UIT products, which are now categorized in this passive asset group, and for which we earn revenues related to transactional sales charges from the sale of these products and income  from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer prices of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products.

Note:  AUM measured in the one-, three-, and five-year peer group rankings represents 60%, 60%, and 58% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one-, three-, and five-year basis represents 72%, 71%, and 65% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of 6/30/10. Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each funds market (Lipper, Morningstar, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each GIPS composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes Invesco PowerShares, W.L. Ross & Co., Invesco Private Capital, non-discretionary direct real estate products and CLOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different.
