Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $604.5 billion, an increase of 5.4% month over month.  The month over month increase in AUM was driven primarily by positive returns from global financial markets and strengthening foreign currencies against the USD. The benefit from stronger foreign currency against the USD resulted in an increase of $4.5 billion of AUM in the month.  Additionally, net long-term flows were positive during the month and driven by ETF, UIT and Passive assets. Average assets for Q3 2010 were $583.3 billion.
