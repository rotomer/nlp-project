--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 for the third quarter of 2010 (second quarter 2010: $0.27). Adjusted net income was $185.0 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $125.4 million). On a U.S. GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.32 for the third quarter (second quarter: $0.09), and net income attributable to common shareholders was $154.7 million (second quarter: $40.8 million). The third quarter results reflect three months of activity for the acquired Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, which closed June 1, 2010 (the acquired business). On a U.S. GAAP basis, third quarter earnings includes $26.8 million of transaction and integration charges (second quarter: $79.3 millio n) related to the acquired business.
Atlanta, October 25, 2010
Driven by consistent, long-term investment performance, we continue to see strong momentum in our business during the first full quarter after our combination with Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, said Martin L. Flanagan, Invesco president and chief executive officer.  By successfully managing the pre-close integration process, we were able to begin delivering the tremendous value of the combined organization for clients from day one.
 
 
 
 
Assets Under Management
Total assets under management (AUM) at September 30, 2010, were $604.5 billion (June 30, 2010: $557.7 billion), an increase of $46.8 billion during the third quarter. Long-term net inflows were $4.9 billion for the third quarter, compared to $13.9 billion for the second quarter, and included $1.3 billion of net inflows in AUM excluding ETF, UIT and passive investments, compared to a second quarter net outflow of $0.8 billion. Net long-term inflows of ETF, UIT and Passive AUM of $3.6 billion compared to second quarter inflows of $14.7 billion, the second quarter including a $15.8 billion institutional passive mandate sourced in Japan.
Market gains and losses led to a $34.4 billion increase in AUM during the third quarter, compared to a $24.2 billion reduction in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rate movements led to an $8.2 billion increase in AUM during the third quarter, compared to a $3.4 billion reduction in the second quarter. Institutional money market net outflows were $2.4 billion for the third quarter, compared to $0.9 billion net outflows for the second quarter.
Average AUM during the third quarter were $583.3 billion, compared to $480.5 billion for the second quarter. The acquired business added $114.6 billion of AUM on June 1, 2010. During the third quarter, the acquisition of Australian equities manager, Concord Capital, added $3.1 billion of AUM offset by $1.4 billion disposition arising from the sale of Echo Point Investment Management. Further analysis of AUM is included in the supplemental schedules to this release.
Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the companys third quarter 2010 and second quarter 2010 non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages 7 to 9 of this release.
The third quarter results include the acquired business for the full quarter. The second quarter included the results of the acquired business from the closing date of June 1, 2010. As discussed in the second quarter release the integration of the acquired business into the existing Invesco business is largely complete and segregated expense information for each component is no longer available. Prior to any significant product mergers, revenues associated with the acquired business can be separately identified and, as a result, the impact on the quarter can be estimated.

Net revenues increased by $118.1 million (20.1%) to $707.1 million in the third quarter from $589.0 million in the second quarter. The acquired business accounted for an estimated $96 million of the quarter over quarter increase. Foreign exchange rate changes increased third quarter net revenues by $8.1 million when compared to the second quarter. The remaining increase was largely attributable to market gains and net sales in the underlying AUM.
Investment management fees, as adjusted, increased by $95.7 million (14.7%) to $748.7 million in the third quarter from $653.0 million in the second quarter. The acquired business contributed an estimated increase of $74 million. Foreign exchange rate changes increased third quarter management fees by $11.0 million when compared to second quarter.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, increased $52.2 million (37.4%) to $191.6 million in the third quarter, from $139.4 million in the second quarter, with the acquired business accounting for an estimated $50 million of the increase. Performance fees in the third quarter were $2.5 million compared to $3.5 million in the second quarter. Other revenues, as adjusted, in the third quarter increased by $16.9 million (103.0%) to $33.3 million, from $16.4 million in the second quarter, with the acquired business contributing an estimated $14 million to the increase.
Net revenue is calculated after deducting third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, of $269.0 million in the third quarter, compared to $223.3 million in the second quarter. The increase of $45.7 million includes an estimated $42 million from the acquired business and foreign exchange rate changes increased the third quarter third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by $3.9 million.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted, increased by $61.0 million (15.2%) to $461.3 million in the third quarter from $400.3 million in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating expenses, as adjusted, by $5.4 million when compared to the second quarter, with the remaining increase of $55.6 million the result largely of an additional two months of the acquired business expenses.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, increased by $37.6 million (14.5%) to $297.7 million in the third quarter, from $260.1 million in the second quarter. The acquired business accounted for the majority of the quarter on quarter increase in employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, together with some increases in variable compensation, principally bonus and sales commission. Foreign exchange rate changes increased third quarter employee compensation expenses by $3.7 million when compared to second quarter. The third quarter also included severance costs of $3.4 million compared to $4.8 million in the second quarter.

Marketing expenses, as adjusted, increased by $9.6 million (27.0%) to $45.1 million in the third quarter, from $35.5 million in the second quarter of 2010, the increase largely related to the acquired business.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, increased $7.8 million (13.8%) to $64.2 million in the third quarter, from $56.4 million in the second quarter, again largely driven by the additional office space associated with the acquired business with foreign exchange rate changes adding $0.8 million when compared to second quarter.
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, increased $6.0 million (12.4%) to $54.3 million in the third quarter, from $48.3 million in the second quarter, again largely linked to the acquired business with foreign exchange rate changes adding $0.7 million when compared to second quarter.
The effective tax rate decreased to 23.1% for the third quarter, from 29.3% for the second quarter primarily due to the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions, and the inclusion of a full quarter of the acquired business tax amortization benefit.
U.S. GAAP Earnings
Operating revenues increased 21.1% to $953.1 million in the third quarter from $787.0 million in the second quarter. Operating expenses increased by 7.6% to $770.2 million in the third quarter, from $715.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Operating expenses included $26.8 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the third quarter related to the acquired business (second quarter: $79.3 million). Operating expenses in the second quarter included $8.9 million representing fund reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations.
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 26.1% for the third quarter from 47.4% for the second quarter primarily due to the reduction in non-deductible transaction and integration charges related to the acquired business and the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions.
Capital Management
Cash and cash equivalents were $664.1 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $555.6 million at June 30, 2010. Long-term debt was $1,394.2 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $1,395.7 million at June 30, 2010, with a balance of $648.5 million draw on the credit facility at September 30, 2010 (June 30: $650.0 million).
During the third quarter, the company resumed purchases related to the share repurchase program authorized in April 2008, purchasing $127.7 million, representing 6.4 million shares at an average share price of $19.82.
In October, the company became one of only four asset managers to earn a strong enterprise risk management rating from Standard & Poors.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 7 through 9. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in our Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments include transaction and integration charges of $26.8 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $79.3 million, third quarter 2009: $1.0 million). The taxation effect of this amount, calculated at the applicable tax rates for the tax deductible portion of the charges, is $9.0 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $14.8 million, third quarter 2009: $0.2 million) giving a net adjustment of $17.8 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $64.5 million, third quarter 2009: $0.8 million). This equates to $0.04 of EPS in the third quarter (second quarter: $0.14, third quarter 2009: none)
Transaction and integration charges incurred during the third quarter include $7.5 million of staff costs (second quarter: $18.5 million, third quarter 2009: none), $6.3 million of technology contractor and related costs (second quarter: $4.3 million, third quarter 2009: none), and $13.0 million of professional services, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance (second quarter: $18.9 million, third quarter 2009: none).
Acquisition related adjustments also include intangible amortization of $9.4 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $5.2 million; third quarter 2009: $3.2 million) and the amortization of prepaid compensation of $5.0 million (same for all quarters presented) related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. Taxation of $1.0 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $0.6 million, third quarter 2009: $0.1 million) is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit, giving a net adjustment of $13.4 million for the third quarter (second quarter: $9.6 million, third quarter 2009: $8.1 million).
Adjustments for deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles that are amortized for tax purposes were $6.6 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $4.2 million, third quarter 2009: $3.6 million).
Management fees earned by the company from consolidated investment products were $10.5 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $12.3 million, third quarter 2009: $1.9 million) while other revenues of $0.1 million were recorded by the consolidated investment products in the third quarter (second quarter: $0.0 million, third quarter 2009: $0.4 million reduction). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back while the other revenues are excluded. Similarly, the consolidated investment

products expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. Interest income of consolidated investment products was $70.3 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $53.1 million, third quarter 2009: none), interest expense was $35.6 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $25.6 million, third quarter 2009: none) and net investment losses were $148.3 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $187.2 million gains, third quarter 2009: $2.1 million gains). The impact of these adjustments was offset by a $127.5 million loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities (second quarter: $197.3 million gain, third quarter 2009: $0.8 million loss). The consolidat ion of the investment products resulted in an increase of $1.8 million in net income attributable to common shareholders in our third quarter U.S. GAAP earnings (second quarter: $2.2 million increase, third quarter 2009: no impact). The above adjustments remove this impact.
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810 Consolidation and in accordance with the standard, 2009 comparative periods have not been restated.
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. These investments are held to hedge the economic exposure to market movements. The appreciation of the compensation liability was $4.0 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $2.1 million depreciation) with an investment gain and interest and dividend income of $12.1 million in the third quarter (second quarter: $5.8 million loss) on the assets held to hedge the economic compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment gains and losses are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation change of $2.4 million in the third quarter (second quarter: credit of $1.2 million), result in a net income deduction of $5.7 million for the third quarter (second quarter: addition of $2.5 million).
4.      Other Reconciling Items
Included within the second quarter 2010 general and administrative expenses is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The companys income tax provision includes tax benefits of $2.9 million relating to this charge. The net of tax charge of $6.0 million is equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.01. Due to the unique character and magnitude of this charge, its impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.

Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (as used for diluted EPS).

These products previously were not included in the company's reported AUM, because the company does not receive investment management fees from these assets. These assets are marketed as Invesco products, and to include them as part of our AUM better represents the full size and capabilities of Invesco. Additionally, the company may receive performance, service, distribution, and/or transaction revenues from these assets. The inclusion of these assets as AUM changed previously reported AUM, gross and net revenue calculations on AUM and gross and net revenue calculations on AUM before performance fees. Additionally, as a result of the acquired business, the company now manages UIT products, which are now categorized in this passive asset group, and for which we earn revenues related to transactional sales charges from the sale of these products and income from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer prices of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products.
