[Invesco Distributor letterhead]
November 10, 2010
Dear Shareholder,
On June 1, Invesco completed its acquisition of Morgan Stanleys retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments.
The combination of Invesco and Van Kampen/Morgan Stanley retail expanded the depth and breadth of investment capabilities we offer investors and significantly enhanced our U.S. market presence.  The Invesco and Van Kampen/Morgan Stanley retail investment capabilities were highly complementary, which enabled us to provide a more balanced product offering to investors.  As a result of the combination, Invesco gained investment talent for a number of investment strategies, including U.S. Value Equity, U.S. Small Cap Growth Equity, Tax-Free Municipals, Bank Loans and others.  With this enhanced expertise and a comprehensive range of diverse investment capabilities, we believe Invesco is better positioned than ever to meet the needs of investors across the globe.
As we have communicated publicly, we are reviewing the full Invesco product line and making decisions that will sharpen our offering to investors.  A key goal of this effort is to reduce overlap and enhance efficiency across the product line for the benefit of fund shareholders.
As the next step in the process of integrating the combined business, the Invesco Funds Board of Trustees has approved a realignment of our U.S. mutual fund product line, pending shareholder approval.  When completed, the proposed realignment will:
 
As an investment-led organization, Invesco is dedicated to achieving strong, long-term investment performance on behalf of our shareholders and ensuring that our actions are guided by our clients first culture.  To achieve this, our approach for realigning the funds favors those funds whose investment teams will be managing the fund on a go-forward basis and which have in place the longest tenured track record that is most representative of the teams investment process.
An important consideration in our realignment efforts was to ensure that fund expenses on the resulting mutual fund product line remain competitive and that we seek ways to continue managing overall expenses for the benefit of shareholders.  We are pleased to report that, through the realignment, most shareholders will experience a reduction in the total expense ratio for their funds and, in aggregate, shareholders will receive an estimated $78 million in benefits over the next two years through fee reductions, contractual expense limitations and certain one-time cost savings.  In those limited instances where management fee expenses are estimated to increase, Invesco will cap expenses on the acquiring fund at the lowest total expense ratio cap of any approved fund in each proposed transaction.

You will find additional information regarding the proposed changes by visiting invesco.com/us. We anticipate the realignment process will take from 6-9 months to complete as each of the proposed transactions must receive the required regulatory and fund shareholder approvals.  Some important milestones in this process include:
 
We believe these changes will enhance our offering and better enable Invesco to deliver strong, consistent investment results to investors over the long term.  We will continue to communicate with you as we work to ensure a smooth transition for those funds impacted by these changes.  Should you have questions in the meantime, please call Invesco at 800-959-4246or visit invesco.com/us.  We value our relationship with you and remain dedicated to helping investors achieve their financial objectives.
