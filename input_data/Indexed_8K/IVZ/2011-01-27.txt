Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting.

Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the companys fourth quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter 2010 non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages 9 to 13 of this release.
Net revenues increased by $54.6 million (7.7%) to $761.7 million in the fourth quarter from $707.1 million in the third quarter. The increase was principally due to increases in investment management fees and performance fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased fourth quarter net revenues by $5.3 million when compared to the third quarter.
Investment management fees, as adjusted, increased $50.4 million (6.7%) to $799.1 million in the fourth quarter from $748.7 million in the third quarter with the increase correlating to the 5.6% increase in average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes increased fourth quarter management fees by $6.8 million when compared to third quarter.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, increased $10.4 million (5.4%) to $202.0 million in the fourth quarter from $191.6 million in the third quarter, the increase similarly correlating to the increase in average AUM.
Performance fees in the fourth quarter were $18.7 million compared to $2.5 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter fees were largely earned by the Private Wealth Management and European Real Estate teams. Other revenues, as adjusted, in the fourth quarter increased $1.3 million (3.9%) to $34.6 million from $33.3 million in the third quarter.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were $292.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $269.0 million in the third quarter. The increase of $23.7 million (8.8%) primarily reflects the increase in investment management fees and service distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased the fourth quarter third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by $2.5 million.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted, increased by $20.2 million (4.4%) to $481.5 million in the fourth quarter from $461.3 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating expenses, as adjusted, by $4.0 million when compared to the third quarter.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, increased by $7.4 million (2.5%) to $305.1 million in the fourth quarter from $297.7 million in the third quarter. The increase is primarily in variable compensation, including bonuses linked to the fourth quarter performance fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased fourth quarter employee compensation expenses by $2.7 million when compared to third quarter.

Marketing expenses, as adjusted, increased by $6.8 million (15.1%) to $51.9 million in the fourth quarter from $45.1 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in marketing expenses reflects increased marketing activities in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, increased $2.1 million (3.3%) to $66.3 million in the fourth quarter from $64.2 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes added $0.5 million to these expenses when compared to third quarter.
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, increased $3.9 million (7.2%) to $58.2 million in the fourth quarter from $54.3 million in the third quarter. The increase in these expenses reflects a general increase in business activities during the fourth quarter.
Non-operating other income and expenses included additional gains from partnership and seed money investments in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter. The effective tax rate increased to 26.0% for the fourth quarter from 23.1% for the third quarter as the third quarter included the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions. The increase was lower than anticipated due to adjustments to tax positions to reflect actual tax returns filed.
U.S. GAAP Earnings
Operating revenues increased 7.9% to $1,028.5 million in the fourth quarter from $953.1 million in the third quarter. Operating expenses increased by 7.7% to $829.8 million in the fourth quarter from $770.2 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Operating expenses included $26.7 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $26.8 million).
Included within general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 is a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Assessments were levied upon all Financial Services Authority (FSA)-registered investment management companies in proportion to their "eligible income" (as defined by the FSA) to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms. The net of tax charge of $11.0 million in the fourth quarter is equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.02. Due to the unique character and magnitude of this charge, its impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 24.1% for the fourth quarter from 26.1% for the third quarter primarily due to a reduction in non-deductible transaction and integration charges when compared to previous estimates.

Capital Management
Cash and cash equivalents were $740.5 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $664.1 million at September 30, 2010. Long-term debt was $1,315.7 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $1,394.2 million at September 30, 2010, the reduction reflecting payments of $78.5 million against the credit facility. The credit facility balance was $570.0 million at December 31, 2010 (September 30: $648.5 million).
During the fourth quarter, the company made share repurchases of $64.5 million, representing 2.9 million shares at an average share price of $21.99 (third quarter: $127.7 million, representing 6.4 million shares at an average share price of $19.82).
Today the company is declaring a fourth-quarter cash dividend of 11 cents per share to holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on March 9, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 23, 2011.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 9 through 13. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in our Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. and all related tax effects. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810 Consolidation and in accordance with the standard, 2009 comparative periods have not been restated.
Management fees earned by the company from consolidated investment products were $11.9 million in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $10.5 million, fourth quarter 2009: $2.1 million, 2010: $45.3 million, 2009: $8.0 million). There were no other revenues recorded by the consolidated investment products in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $0.1 million, fourth quarter 2009: $0.2 million, 2010: $0.3 million, 2009: $2.0 million). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back while the other revenues are excluded. Similarly, the consolidated investment products expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the inves tment products resulted in an increase of $1.2 million in net income attributable to common shareholders in our fourth quarter U.S. GAAP earnings (third quarter: $1.8 million increase, fourth quarter 2009: none, 2010: $6.8 million increase, 2009: none). The above adjustments remove this impact.

This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. These investments are held to hedge the economic exposure to market movements. The appreciation of the compensation liability was $5.5 million in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $4.0 million appreciation, 2010:$9.3 million) with an investment gain and interest and dividend income of $8.2 million in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $12.1 million gain, 2010: $16.9 million) on the assets held to hedge the economic compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment gains and losses are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter (third quarter: $2.4 million, 2010: $2.3 million), result in a net income deduction of $1.8 millio n for the fourth quarter (third quarter: $5.7 million, 2010: $5.3 million).
4.      Other Reconciling Items
Included within general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 is a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Assessments were levied upon all Financial Services Authority (FSA)-registered investment management companies in proportion to their "eligible income" (as defined by the FSA) to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms. Included within general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2010 is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The companys income tax provision includes tax benefits of $4.3 million in the fourth qua rter and $2.9 million in the second quarter relating to these charges. The net of tax charges of $11.0 million in the fourth quarter and $6.0 million in the second quarter is equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.02 and $0.01 in the respective periods. Due to the unique character and magnitude of these charges, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (as used for diluted EPS).

These products previously were not included in the company's reported AUM, because the company does not receive investment management fees from these assets. These assets are marketed as Invesco products, and to include them as part of our AUM better represents the full size and capabilities of Invesco. Additionally, the company may receive performance, service, distribution, and/or transaction revenues from these assets. The inclusion of these assets as AUM changed previously reported AUM, gross and net revenue calculations on AUM and gross and net revenue calculations on AUM before performance fees. Additionally, as a result of the acquired business, the company now manages UIT products, which are now categorized in this passive asset group, and for which we earn revenues related to transactional sales charges from the sale of these products and income from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer prices of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products.
