Earnings Summary
 
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
 
Non-GAAP Earnings
 
This section discusses the companys first quarter 2011 compared to the fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages 8 through 12 of this release.
 
Net revenues decreased by $9.9 million (1.3%) to $751.8 million in the first quarter from $761.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in performance fees earned in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter net revenues by $6.6 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.

Investment management fees, as adjusted, increased $17.0 million (2.1%) to $816.1 million in the first quarter from $799.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter management fees by $9.1 million when compared to fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in management fees correlates with higher average AUM, although the two fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter reduced retail management fees. The first quarter management fees from our alternative asset class were reduced by $7.5 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 as a large fund became substantially invested.
 
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, decreased $3.3 million (1.6%) to $198.7 million in the first quarter from $202.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease included a $2.0 million reduction in 12b-1 distribution fees, a result of fewer B-share class sales and continued conversion of B-share fee structures to class A-shares.
 
Performance fees in the first quarter were $3.8 million compared to $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Other revenues, as adjusted, in the first quarter decreased $1.9 million (5.5%) to $32.7 million from $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were $299.5 million in the first quarter compared to $292.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase of $6.8 million (2.3%) is consistent with the growth in average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes increased the first quarter third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by $3.6 million.
 
Total operating expenses, as adjusted, decreased by $1.8 million (0.4%) to $479.7 million in the first quarter from $481.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating expenses, as adjusted, by $5.4 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, decreased by $5.4 million (1.8%) to $299.7 million in the first quarter from $305.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Base salary increases, seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher severance costs were offset by reduced share-based and bonus expenses, including reduced bonus expenses associated with performance fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter employee compensation expenses by $3.5 million when compared to fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Marketing expenses, as adjusted, increased by $1.9 million (3.7%) to $53.8 million in the first quarter from $51.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in marketing expenses reflects increased advertising in the U.S. during the first quarter.
 
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, decreased $1.7 million (2.6%) to $64.6 million in the first quarter from $66.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Additional property costs associated with the opening of our Hyderabad office during the first quarter were offset by reduced outsourced administration costs.

General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, increased $3.4 million (5.8%) to $61.6 million in the first quarter from $58.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange rate changes added $1.0 million to these expenses when compared to fourth quarter of 2010 and greater UK irrecoverable VAT expense contributed to the remaining increase.
 
Non-operating other income and expenses included reduced gains from partnership and seed money investments in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Investment gains realized on seed investments during the first quarter were $3.2 million compared to fourth quarter of 2010 gains of $6.2 million. The effective tax rate increased to 27.6% for the first quarter from 26.0% for the fourth quarter of 2010 as the fourth quarter included certain beneficial adjustments to tax positions to reflect actual tax returns filed.
 
U.S. GAAP Earnings
 
Operating revenues decreased 0.1% to $1,027.3 million in the first quarter from $1,028.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating expenses decreased by 3.4% to $801.6 million in the first quarter from $829.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Operating expenses included $7.9 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $26.7 million). Included within general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 was a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
 
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, increased to 29.9% for the first quarter from 24.1% for the fourth quarter of 2010 as the fourth quarter included higher tax deductible transaction and integration charges when compared to previous estimates.
 
Capital Management
 
Cash and cash equivalents were $471.9 million at March 31, 2011 compared to $740.5 million at December 31, 2010.

The staff annual cash bonus payments were also funded during the first quarter and occurred in conjunction with new share-based awards that will vest over four years.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 8 through 10. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
 
 
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. and all related tax effects. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
 
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of additional guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 Consolidation.
 
Management fees earned by the company from consolidated investment products were $11.1 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $11.9 million; first quarter 2010: $10.6 million). There were no other revenues recorded by the consolidated investment products in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: none; first quarter 2010: $0.2 million). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back while the other revenues are excluded. Similarly, the consolidated investment products expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an increase of $9.6 million in net income attributable to common shareholders in our first quarter U.S. GAAP earnings (fourth quarter 2010: $1.2 million increase; first quarter 2010: $1.6 million increase). The above adjustments remove this impact.
 
 
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
 
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. These investments are held to hedge the economic exposure to market movements. The appreciation of the compensation liability was $4.1 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $5.5 million appreciation; first quarter 2010:$1.9 million appreciation) with an investment gain and interest and dividend income of $5.2 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $8.2 million gain; first quarter 2010: $2.4 million gain) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of $0.4 million in the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $0.9 million; first quarter 2010: $0.2 million), result in a net income deduction of $0.7 million for the first quarter (fourth quarter 2010: $1.8 million deduction; first quarter 2010: $0.3 million deduction).
 
4.      Other Reconciling Items
 
Included within general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 was a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. An additional $0.4 million charge has been recorded in the first quarter of 2011 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. Assessments were levied upon all Financial Services Authority (FSA)-registered investment management companies in proportion to their "eligible income" (as defined by the FSA) to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms. The companys income tax provision includes tax benefits of $0.1 million in the first quarter and $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 relating to this charge. The net of tax charges of $11.0 million in the fourth quarter were equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.02. Due to the unique character and magnitude of these charges, the impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
 
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
 
 
Adjusted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (as used for diluted EPS).
