Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $661.4 billion, a decrease of 1.1% month over month. The decrease resulted from the combined effects of net outflows principally in the PowerShares QQQ ETFs, negative markets returns and negative foreign exchange. The PowerShares QQQ ETF outflows were partly offset with modestly positive inflows in AUM excluding ETF, UIT and Passive.  FX decreased AUM by $2.5 billion during the month.  Total average assets for the quarter through May 31 were $655.5 billion and average assets excluding ETF, UIT and Passive for the quarter through May 31 were $561.4 billion.
