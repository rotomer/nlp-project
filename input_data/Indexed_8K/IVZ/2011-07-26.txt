---
Atlanta, July 26, 2011
Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2011.
 
Invescos strong, long-term investment performance contributed to positive net inflows of $7.3 billion and strong operating results for the quarter, said Martin L. Flanagan, president and chief executive officer. Reflecting confidence in our business, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for $280 million.

Assets Under Management
Total assets under management (AUM) at June 30, 2011 were $653.7 billion (March 31, 2011: $641.9 billion), an increase of $11.8 billion during the second quarter. Total net inflows were $7.3 billion for the second quarter as detailed below:
Net market gains led to a $3.2 billion increase in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a $12.9 billion increase in the first quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $1.3 billion increase in AUM during the second quarter, compared to a $3.3 billion increase in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Average AUM during the second quarter were $652.8 billion, compared to $630.2 billion for the first quarter of 2011, a 3.6% increase.
 
Earnings Summary
 
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
European Infrastructure
The company is undertaking a broad, transformational initiative to build on its strong position in the European market and to position the business for competitive success in light of significant regulatory changes. This initiative is designed to enhance the European business product platform, better leverage our cross-border distribution efforts, and align our European infrastructure in advance of new regulation. Combined, we believe these forward looking steps will enhance our ability to deliver Invescos comprehensive global investment capabilities to European clients and further strengthen the firms competitive position in this region.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, the company incurred $5.8 million of costs directly related to the implementation of this initiative and will incur total implementation costs of up to $40 million by the projected completion date of December 2012. The $40 million estimate is based on the expected cost to outsource our European transfer agency and on our plans to make certain structural changes to our product and distribution platforms. This initiative is expected to generate material ongoing cost savings that will more than fully offset the implementation

expense within a three year time frame after completion. These implementation costs will be included within the respective expense line items in the U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statement and will be excluded in arriving at non-GAAP earnings information.
Marketing Support Expense Presentation Change
As described in our press release on July 12, 2011, this earnings release reflects the change in presentation of marketing support expenses from marketing expenses to third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses. The change is intended to provide investors with improved disclosure of third-party distribution and discretionary marketing expenses and to allow for better comparison with similar methods of presentation used by peer investment managers.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the companys second quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2011 non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages 8 through 13 of this release.
 
Net revenues increased by $26.9 million (3.7%) to $751.2 million in the second quarter from $724.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was principally due to increases in investment management fees earned in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased second quarter net revenues by $5.4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2011.
 
Investment management fees, as adjusted, increased $28.2 million (3.5%) to $844.3 million in the second quarter from $816.1 million in the first quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange rate changes increased second quarter management fees by $7.3 million when compared to first quarter of 2011. The increase in management fees correlates with higher average AUM.
 
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted, increased $7.5 million (3.8%) to $206.2 million in the second quarter from $198.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, also correlating with higher average AUM in the second quarter.
 
Performance fees, as adjusted, in the second quarter were $7.6 million compared to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter performance fees were earned in the U.K. and in the U.S. private equity business. Other revenues, as adjusted, in the second quarter were $32.2 million compared to $32.7 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were $339.1 million in the second quarter compared to $327.0 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase of $12.1 million (3.7%) primarily reflects the increase in investment management fees and service and distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased the second quarter third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by $2.6 million.

Total operating expenses, as adjusted, increased by $14.2 million (3.1%) to $466.4 million in the second quarter from $452.2 million in the first quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating expenses, as adjusted, by $4.6 million when compared to the first quarter of 2011.
 
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted, increased by $11.2 million (3.7%) to $310.9 million in the second quarter from $299.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter included a full quarter of the annual base salary increases and share-based awards, both granted late in the first quarter. The second quarter also includes a full quarter of the Hyderabad staff costs that had previously been part of outsourced administration costs, within property, office, and technology expenses. Increased variable compensation expenses also contributed to the increase which was partly offset by reduced payroll taxes. Foreign exchange rate changes increased second quarter employee compensation expenses by $3.3 million when compared to first quarter of 2011.
 
Marketing expenses, as adjusted, increased by $0.4 million (1.5%) to $26.7 million in the second quarter from $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. Additional sales literature costs were partly offset by reduced advertising expenditure.
 
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted, decreased $2.1 million (3.3%) to $62.5 million in the second quarter from $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. This was primarily due to the decline in outsourced administration costs as we internalized our Hyderabad operations during the first quarter.
 
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted, increased $4.7 million (7.6%) to $66.3 million in the second quarter from $61.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter included an increase in staff recruitment and travel costs. Foreign exchange rate changes added $0.5 million to these expenses when compared to first quarter of 2011.
 
Non-operating other income and expenses included increased equity in earnings from partnership investments in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter. The effective tax rate decreased to 26.0% for the second quarter from 27.6% for the first quarter of 2011.
U.S. GAAP Earnings
Operating revenues increased 4.2% to $1,070.0 million in the second quarter from $1,027.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. Operating expenses increased by 4.4% to $837.0 million in the second quarter from $801.6 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Operating expenses included $11.3 million of transaction and integration charges incurred in the second quarter compared to $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2011. Operating expenses also included $5.8 million of European infrastructure expenses for the second quarter as discussed above.

The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, decreased to 29.2% for the second quarter from 29.9% for the first quarter of 2011.
Capital Management

Total debt was $1,583.7 million at June 30, 2011 compared to $1,332.7 million at March 31, 2011. The credit facility balance was $838.0 million at June 30, 2011 compared to $587.0 million at March 31, 2011.
 
During the second quarter, the company made share repurchases of $279.9 million, representing 11.3 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.69 (first quarter 2011: $53.1 million, representing 2.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $25.58).
 
In June the company amended and restated the existing $1.25 billion Credit Agreement to extend the term of the facility to five years maturing on June 3, 2016.
 
Today the company is announcing a second-quarter cash dividend of 12.25 cents per share to holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on September 8, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2011.

The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages 8 through 10. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. and all related tax effects. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
 
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of additional guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 Consolidation.
 
Management fees earned by the company but which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products were $12.2 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2011: $11.1 million; second quarter 2010: $12.3 million). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management fees are added back into net revenues. Similarly, the consolidated investment products operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an increase of $5.2 million in net income attributable to common shareholders in our first quarter U.S. GAAP earnings (first quarter 2011: $9.6 million increase; second quarter 2010: $2.2 million increase). The above adjustments remove this impact.
 
 
 
 
 
11
 
 
 
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market appreciation of the compensation liability was $2.5 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2011: $4.1 million appreciation; second quarter 2010:$2.1 million depreciation) with an investment gain and interest and dividend income of $4.5 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2011: $5.2 million gain; second quarter 2010: $5.8 million loss) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of $0.5 million in the second quarter (first quarter 2011: $0.4 million; second quarter 2010: $1.2 million), result in a net income deduction of $1.5 million for the second quarter (first quarter 2011: $0.7 million deduction; second quarter 2010: $2.5 million addition).
 
4.      European Infrastructure
 
As described on page 2, expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. For the second quarter of 2011, this adjustment includes $3.1 million in compensation expenses, primarily due to severance costs, $2.5 million in general and administrative costs, primarily related to consulting services and $0.2 million of technology costs. The companys income tax provision included tax benefits of $0.6 million in the second quarter 2011 relating to this charge. Due to the projected magnitude and nature of the implementation costs, the impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
 
5.      Other reconciling items
 
Included within general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2011 was an additional charge of $0.4 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Assessments were levied upon all Financial Services Authority (FSA)-registered investment management companies in proportion to their eligible income (as defined by the FSA) to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms. The companys income tax provision included tax benefits of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2011 relating to this charge.
 
Included within the second quarter 2010 general and administrative expenses was a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The companys income tax provision includes tax benefits of $2.9 million relating to this charge. The net of tax charge of $6.0 million is equivalent to a reduction in diluted EPS of $0.01. Due to the unique character and magnitude of these charges in current and prior periods, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.

Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
 
 
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
