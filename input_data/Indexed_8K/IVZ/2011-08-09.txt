Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $652.8 billion, a decrease of 0.1% month over month. The decrease largely resulted from a decrease in Institutional money market and the effects of negative market returns. FX increased AUM by $3.2 billion during the month. Long-term net flows, excluding ETF, UIT, and Passive AUM, were modestly positive for the month. Total average assets for the quarter through July 31 were $658.3 billion and average assets excluding ETF, UIT and Passive for the quarter through July 31 were $564.7 billion.
