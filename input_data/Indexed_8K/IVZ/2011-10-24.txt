Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the company's third quarter 2011 compared to the second quarter 2011 non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages
6
through
10
of this release.
Net revenues
decreased
by
$45.1 million
(
6.0%
) to
$706.1 million
in the third quarter from
$751.2 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. The decrease was principally due to decreases in investment management fees earned in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
third quarter
net revenues by
$4.3 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2011
.
Investment management fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$40.2 million
(
4.8%
) to
$804.1 million
in the
third quarter
from
$844.3 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
third quarter
management fees by
$6.1 million
when compared to
second quarter 2011
. The decrease in management fees correlates with lower average AUM, the change in AUM asset class mix as equity market values reduced during the third quarter, and fee waivers associated with the U.S. mutual fund product realignment.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$17.1 million
(
8.3%
) to
$189.1 million
in the
third quarter
from
$206.2 million
in the
second quarter 2011
, also correlating with lower average AUM and reduced transfer agency fees linked to the U.S. mutual fund product realignment.
Performance fees, as adjusted, in the
third quarter
were
$3.0 million
compared to
$7.6 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. Other revenues, as adjusted, decreased by
$5.5 million
in the
third quarter
to
$26.7 million
compared to
$32.2 million
in the
second quarter 2011
, principally due to reduced front-end fees and lower unit investment trust (UIT) sponsor revenues.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were
$316.8 million
in the
third quarter
compared to
$339.1 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. The
decrease
of
$22.3 million
(
6.6%
) primarily reflects the decrease in investment management fees and service and distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
the
third quarter
third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by
$2.5 million
.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$16.0 million
(
3.4%
) to
$450.4 million
in the
third quarter
from
$466.4 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
operating expenses, as adjusted, by
$2.4 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2011
.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$4.6 million
(
1.5%
) to
$306.3 million
in the
third quarter
from
$310.9 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
third quarter
employee compensation expenses by
$1.5 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2011
.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$2.3 million
(
8.6%
) to
$24.4 million
in the
third quarter
from
$26.7 million
in the
second quarter 2011
due to a reduced sponsorship expenditure associated with the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium and reduced advertising.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted,
increased
$0.3 million
(
0.5%
) to
$62.8 million
in the
third quarter
from
$62.5 million
in the
second quarter 2011
.
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
$9.4 million
(
14.2%
) to
$56.9 million
in the
third quarter
from
$66.3 million
in the
second quarter 2011
. The
third quarter
included lower travel, recruitment, and professional services expenses when compared to the second quarter.
Non-operating other income and expenses included reduced equity in earnings from partnership investments and realized gains from seed investments in the
third quarter
when compared to the second quarter. The effective tax rate
decreased
to
22.5%
for the
third quarter
from
26.0%
for the
second quarter 2011
primarily due to the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions.
U.S. GAAP Earnings

6.7%
to
$997.8 million
in the
third quarter
from
$1,070.0 million

second quarter 2011
. Operating expenses also included $5.3 million of European infrastructure expenses for the third quarter compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter 2011.
Included within marketing expenses in the third quarter 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium.
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests,
decreased
to
26.2%
for the
third quarter
from
29.2%
for the
second quarter 2011
primarily due to the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions.

Invesco Ltd.
Notes to the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statements to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statement Information
The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages
6
through
8
. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. and all related tax effects. Additionally, acquisition-related reconciling items include changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, which is offset in the period by increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of additional guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 Consolidation.
Management and performance fees earned by the company but which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products were
$12.3 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2011
:
$12.2 million
;
third quarter 2010
:
$10.5 million
). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management and performance fees are added back into net revenues. Similarly, the consolidated investment products' operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an
increase
of
$3.5 million
in net income attributable to common shareholders in our
third quarter
U.S. GAAP earnings (
second quarter 2011
:
$5.2 million
increase
;
third quarter 2010
:
$1.8 million
increase
). The above adjustments remove this impact.
9
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market
depreciation
of the compensation liability was
$6.3 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2011
:
$2.5 million
appreciation
;
third quarter 2010
:
$4.0 million
appreciation
) with an investment
loss
, net of interest and dividend income, of
$17.6 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2011
:
$4.5 million
gain
;
third quarter 2010
:
$12.1 million
gain
) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation credit of
$3.4 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2011
:
$0.5 million
charge;
third quarter 2010
:
$2.4 million
charge), result in a net income
addition
of
$7.9 million
for the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2011
:
$1.5 million
deduction
;
third quarter 2010
:
$5.7 million
deduction
).
As announced earlier this year, the company is outsourcing its European transfer agency and is making certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. Expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. For the
third quarter 2011
, this adjustment includes $3.3 million in compensation expenses (
second quarter 2011
: $3.1 million), primarily due to severance costs, $1.3 million in general and administrative costs (
second quarter 2011
: $2.5 million), primarily related to consulting services and $0.7 million of technology costs (
second quarter 2011
: $0.2 million). The company's income tax provision included tax benefits of $0.5 million in the
third quarter 2011
(
second quarter 2011
: $0.6 million benefit) relating to this charge. Due to the projected magnitude and nature of the implementation costs, the impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
Included within marketing expenses in the third quarter 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium that occurred during the third quarter. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $4.0 million in the third quarter 2011 relating to the credit. Due to the unique character and magnitude of this credit, its impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

(a)
    
The beginning balances were adjusted to reflect certain asset reclassifications.
(b)
    
Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the third quarter for our JVs in China was
$3.3 billion
(second quarter 2011: $3.5 billion; third quarter 2010: $3.4 billion). For year to date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the nine months of 2011 for our JVs in China was
$3.4 billion
(nine months of 2010:
$3.6 billion
). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. The company evaluates net revenue yield instead. See the Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP information on pages
6
through
10
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(c)
    
Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages
6
through
10
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(d)    The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, real estate, commodities, currencies, financial structures, Global Macro, REITS, private capital, and Risk Premia Capture.
(e)    Ending Money Market AUM includes
$69.1 billion
in institutional money market AUM and
$4.5 billion
in retail money market AUM.
(f)    As a result of fund mergers in the second quarter of 2011, the market gains and losses / reinvestment line includes
$0.9 bi
llion transferred from the balanced to the equity asset class.
(g)    The company acquired $114.6 billion in AUM at June 1, 2010 as part of the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. Other acquisitions in the year added $1.7 billion of AUM, net of minor dispositions related to the integration of the acquired business.
