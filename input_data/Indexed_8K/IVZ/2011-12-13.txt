Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $622.4 billion, a decrease of 2.1% month over month. The decrease was largely the result of negative market returns and unfavorable foreign exchange. FX decreased AUM by $2.9 billion in the month. Active long-term net flows were slightly negative for the month. Total average assets for the quarter through November 30 were $621.7 billion and average active assets for the quarter through November 30 were $528.9 billion.
