Joint and Several Liability
Borrowers Liabilities
Section 2.20(d)
 
(a)
 
The guaranty of each Borrower hereunder shall be a continuing guaranty relating to any Borrowers Liabilities, including those arising under successive transactions which shall either continue Obligations or from time to time renew any Obligations after such Obligations shall have been satisfied.  Any payment by any Borrower shall not reduce the Borrowers maximum obligation hereunder. The guaranty of each Borrower hereunder is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.
 
(b)
 
The Obligations of each Borrower are independent, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against one Borrower whether action is brought against any other Borrower or whether any other Borrower is joined in any such action or actions; and each Borrower waives the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder.
 
(c)
 
Each Borrower agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility to inquire into the apportionment, allocation or disposition of the proceeds of any Credit Extension as between the Borrowers, and acknowledges that its liability hereunder shall not be reduced or diminished by such Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Borrower giving or receiving of notices and other communications, making requests for, or effecting conversions or continuations of, Loans or Letters of Credit, executing and delivering certificates, or receiving or allocating disbursements from the Lenders.  Each Borrower acknowledges that the handling of any Advances, Letters of Credit or other Obligations made hereunder or under any other Loan Document on a joint borrowing basis as set forth in this Agreement is solely an accommodation to the Borrowers and is done at their request.  Each Borrower agrees that no Lender nor the Administrative Agent nor the L/C Issuer shall incur any liability to such Borrower as a result of such accommodation.
 
 
 
53
 
 
(d)
 
Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that the request for any joint handling of any Advances, Letters of Credit or other Obligations made hereunder or under any other Loan Document was made because the Borrowers are engaged in related operations and are interdependent.  Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the availability of each Advance, Letter of Credit or other Obligation because the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the functions of the Borrowers as a group.
 
(e)
 
Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that (i) it has established adequate means of obtaining from any other Borrower on a continuing basis financial and other information pertaining to the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of any other Borrower and its respective property, and (ii) it now is and hereafter will be completely familiar with the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of any other Borrower, and its property.  Each Borrower hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent to disclose to such Borrower any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of any other Borrower, or the property of any other Borrower, whether now or hereafter known by the Administrative Agent or any Lender during the term of this Agreement.
 
(f)
 
Each Borrower expressly waives any right to require the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to marshal assets in favor of any Borrower or any other Person or to proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person or any collateral provided by any other Borrower or any other Person, and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may proceed against any Borrower and/or collateral in such order as they shall determine in their sole and absolute discretion.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may file a separate action or actions against any Borrower, whether action is brought or prosecuted with respect to any other security or against any other Person, or whether any other Person is joined in any such action or actions.  Each Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and any other Borrower may deal with each other in connection with the Obligations, the Borrowers Liabilities or otherwise, or alter any contracts or agreements now or hereafter existing between any of them, in any manner whatsoever, all without in any way altering or affecting the obligations of such Borrower under the Loan Documents.
 
(g)
 
Each Borrower expressly waives any and all defenses now or hereafter arising or asserted by reason of (i) any disability or other defense of any other Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person with respect to any Obligations, (ii) the unenforceability or invalidity as to any other Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person of the Obligations, (iii) the unenforceability or invalidity of any security or guaranty for the Obligations or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Obligations, (iv) the cessation for any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person (other than by reason of the full payment and performance of all Obligations), (v) to the extent permitted by law, any failure of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to give notice of sale or other disposition to any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person or any defect in any notice that may be
 
 
 
54
 
 
given in connection with any sale or disposition, (vi) to the extent permitted by law, any failure of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to comply with applicable laws in connection with the sale or other disposition of any collateral or other security for any Obligation, including without limitation any failure of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to conduct a commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of any collateral or other security for any obligation, (vii) any act or omission of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that directly or indirectly results in or aids the discharge or release of any Borrower or any Guarantor or the Obligations or any other security or guaranty therefor by operation of law or otherwise, (viii) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a suretys or guarantors obligation in proportion to the principal obligation, (ix) any failure of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any other Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person, (x) the election by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in any bankruptcy proceeding of any other Borrower or any Guarantor, of the application or non-application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, (xi) any extension of credit or the grant of any Lien under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in connection with the bankruptcy of any other Borrower or any Guarantor, (xii) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or (xiii) any agreement or stipulation with any other Borrower or any Guarantor with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding of any Person.
 
(h)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere contained herein or in any other Loan Document to which any Borrower is a party, each Borrower hereby waives, so long as any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, any Advance or other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit or other L/C Obligation shall remain outstanding, with respect to any other Borrower and its successors and assigns (including any surety) and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, to reimbursement, to exoneration, to contribution, to setoff or to any other rights that could accrue to a surety against a principal, to a guarantor against a maker, to an accommodation party against the party accommodated, or to a holder or transferee against a maker and which any Borrower may have or hereafter acquire against any other Borrower or any other Person in connection with or as a result of the execution, delivery and/or performance of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  Each Borrower agrees that, so long as any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, any Advance or other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit or other L/C Obligation shall remain outstanding, it shall not have or assert any such rights against any other Borrower or its successors and assigns or any other party (including any surety), either directly or as an attempted setoff to any action commenced against any Borrower by any other Borrower (as borrower or in any other capacity) or any other party.  Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall not limit or otherwise affect Borrowers liability hereunder, under any other Loan Document to which any Borrower is a party, or the enforceability hereof or thereof.
 
(i)
 
Any obligations of any Borrower or any Guarantor to any other Borrower, now or hereafter existing, including but not limited to any obligations to any Borrower or any Guarantor as subrogee of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or resulting from any Borrowers performance under this guaranty, are hereby subordinated to the Borrowers Liabilities.  Such obligations of any Borrower or a Guarantor to any other Borrower, if the Administrative Agent so requests, shall be enforced, and performance received by such Borrower or such Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on account of the Obligations of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of any Borrower under the other provisions of the guaranty contained herein.

(j)
 
Each Borrower irrevocably appoints IVZ(or, in the event IVZ is no longer a Borrower hereunder pursuant to (and in accordance with) , such other Person appointed by the Borrowers in a Notice of Borrower Assumption delivered pursuant to , or in the event that there is only one Borrower hereunder, such Borrower, the "") as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of all notices (including any Notice of Borrowing) and any Issuer Document, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Advances made by the Lenders to any Borrower hereunder, and (iv) for receiving service of process.  Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by any or each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Borrower Agent, whether or not any Borrower joins therein.  Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication received from the Borrower Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to have been received from each Borrower (to the extent delivery by such Borrower is required by or appropriate under the terms of this Agreement).  Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication required to be delivered by any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer to any Borrower, or the Borrowers collectively, shall be deemed to have been so delivered if delivered to the Borrower Agent, and any proceeds of any Advances made by the Lenders to be made available to any Borrower shall be deemed to have been made available to such Borrower if made available to the Borrower Agent.
