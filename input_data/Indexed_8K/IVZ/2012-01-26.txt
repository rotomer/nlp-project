Invesco's efforts to provide strong, long-term investment performance to our clients contributed to the third year of long-term organic growth for the firm in spite of volatile markets, particularly during the final quarter of 2011, said Martin L.

Our efforts to enhance our business over the past year have positioned us to provide solid results in volatile markets and even stronger results should the markets further strengthen in 2012.

Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in the most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.

Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the company's
fourth quarter 2011
compared to the
third quarter 2011
non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages
8
through
15
of this release.
Net revenues
increased
by
$10.7 million
(
1.5%
) to
$716.8 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$706.1 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The increase was principally due to increases in performance fees and other revenue earned in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, offset by decreases in management fees and service distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
fourth quarter
net revenues by
$6.1 million
when compared to the
third quarter 2011
.
Investment management fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$33.3 million
(
4.1%
) to
$770.8 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$804.1 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The decrease in management fees correlates with lower average AUM. Additionally, the average AUM reduction was weighted towards the higher fee-earning equity asset class. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
fourth quarter
management fees by
$7.7 million
when compared to
third quarter 2011
.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$8.0 million
(
4.2%
) to
$181.1 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$189.1 million
in the
third quarter 2011
, also correlating with lower average AUM.
Performance fees, as adjusted, in the
fourth quarter
were
$24.0 million
compared to
$3.0 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The fourth quarter fees were earned by the private wealth management and real estate teams. Other revenues, as adjusted,
increased
by
$18.2 million
in the
fourth quarter
to
$44.9 million
compared to
$26.7 million
in the
third quarter 2011
, principally due to transaction fees related to private equity and real estate activities.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were
$304.0 million
in the
fourth quarter
compared to
$316.8 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The
decrease
of
$12.8 million
(
4.0%
) primarily reflects the decrease in investment management fees and service and distribution fees, partially offset by an increase in distribution fees payable to third-parties linked to earned real estate performance fee and transaction fee revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
the
fourth quarter
third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by
$2.6 million
.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$10.1 million
(
2.2%
) to
$460.5 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$450.4 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
operating expenses, as adjusted, by
$4.2 million
when compared to the
third quarter 2011
.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$6.0 million
(
2.0%
) to
$312.3 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$306.3 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The increase is primarily in variable compensation, particularly bonuses linked to fourth quarter performance fees and transaction fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
fourth quarter
employee compensation expenses by
$2.7 million
when compared to the
third quarter 2011
.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$2.3 million
(
9.4%
) to
$22.1 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$24.4 million
in the
third quarter 2011
.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
$0.9 million
(
1.4%
) to
$61.9 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$62.8 million
in the
third quarter 2011
.
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted,
increased
$7.3 million
(
12.8%
) to
$64.2 million
in the
3
fourth quarter
from
$56.9 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. Approximately half of the increase is attributable to an elevated level of business activities in the fourth quarter, with the remaining increase resulting from unusual items.
Non-operating other income and expenses, as adjusted, included reduced equity in earnings from partnership investments and reduced gains from seed investments in the
fourth quarter
when compared to the third quarter. The effective tax rate
increased
to
22.9%
for the
fourth quarter
from
22.5%
for the
third quarter 2011
. The third quarter tax rate benefited from the release of a provision made for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, the fourth quarter rate was lower than anticipated due to adjustments to tax positions to reflect actual tax returns filed.
U.S. GAAP Earnings
Operating revenues
decreased
0.1%
to
$997.1 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$997.8 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. Operating expenses
increased
by
2.0%
to
$785.5 million
in the
fourth quarter
from
$770.0 million
in the
third quarter 2011
.
Operating expenses included
$5.5 million
of transaction and integration charges incurred in the
fourth quarter
compared to
$4.7 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. Operating expenses also included $7.7 million of European infrastructure expenses for the fourth quarter compared to $5.3 million for the third quarter. Fourth quarter non-operating other income and expenses includes a $45.0 million credit related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Legal fees associated with this litigation were $3.6 million and are included within operating expenses.
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests,
increased
to
27.3%
for the
fourth quarter
from
26.2%
for the
third quarter 2011
due to the same factors discussed above.
Capital Management
Cash and cash equivalents were
$727.4 million
at
December 31, 2011
compared to $757.0 million at
September 30, 2011
. Total debt was
$1,284.7 million
at
December 31, 2011
compared to $1,389.7 million at
September 30, 2011
, the reduction reflecting repayment of $105.0 million of the credit facility. The credit facility balance was
$539.0 million
at
December 31, 2011
compared to $644.0 million at
September 30, 2011
.

Invesco Ltd.
Notes to the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statements to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statement Information
The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages
8
through
12
. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the October 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. and all related tax effects. Additionally, acquisition-related reconciling items include changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, which are offset in the period by increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
2. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, which are all closely linked to the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM but vary extensively by geography due to differences in distribution channels.  The non-GAAP presentation nets these costs against revenues to arrive at net revenues, which serves to reflect these costs as revenue sharing activities and to remove distortions caused by differing distribution channel fees.
3. Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments
The company has two joint ventures in China.  Enhancing operations in China is one effort that the
13
company believes could improve its competitive position over time.  U.S. GAAP requires classification of the pre-tax joint venture income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.  The non-GAAP adjustment proportionately consolidates these joint ventures, serving to illustrate the contribution of these joint ventures to the operations of the business.
Certain collateralized loan obligation products were consolidated on January 1, 2010, upon adoption of additional guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 Consolidation.
Management and performance fees earned by the company which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products were
$11.7 million
in the
fourth quarter
(
third quarter 2011
:
$12.3 million
;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$11.9 million
; 2011:
$47.3 million
; 2010:
$45.3 million
). There were no other revenues recorded by the consolidated investment products for the year (2010:
$0.3 million
). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management and performance fees are added back into net revenues while other revenues are excluded. Similarly, the consolidated investment products' operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an
increase
of
$1.9 million
in net income attributable to common shareholders in the
fourth quarter
U.S. GAAP earnings (
third quarter 2011
:
$3.5 million
;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$1.2 million
; 2011:
$20.2 million
; 2010:
$6.8 million
). The above adjustments remove this impact.
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market
appreciation
of the compensation liability was
$5.5 million
in the
fourth quarter
(
third quarter 2011
:
$6.3 million
depreciation
;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$5.5 million
appreciation
; 2011:
$5.8 million
appreciation; 2010:
$9.3 million
appreciation) with an investment
gain
, net of interest and dividend income, of
$10.1 million
in the
fourth quarter
(
third quarter 2011
:
$17.6 million
loss
;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$8.2 million
gain
; 2011: $2.2 million gain; 2010: $16.9 million gain) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of
$1.4 million
in the
fourth quarter
(
third quarter 2011
:
$3.4 million
credit;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$0.9 million
charge; 2011: $1.1 million credit; 2010: $2.3 million charge), result in a net income
deduction
of
$3.2 million
for the
fourth quarter
(
third quarter 2011
:
$7.9 million
addition
;
fourth quarter 2010
:
$1.8 million
deduction
; 2011: $2.5 million addition; 2010: $5.3 million deduction).
14
relating to this charge (
third quarter 2011
: $0.5 million; 2011: $1.9 million; 2010: none).
Due to the unique character and magnitude of these items, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

(a)
    
The beginning balances were adjusted to reflect certain asset reclassifications.
(b)
    
Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the
fourth quarter
for our JVs in China was
$3.1 billion
(
third quarter
2011: $3.3 billion;
fourth quarter
2010: $3.6 billion). For year to date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the
twelve months
of 2011 for our JVs in China was
$3.3 billion
(
twelve months
of 2010:
$3.6 billion
). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. The company evaluates net revenue yield instead. See the Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP information on pages
8
through
15
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(c)
    
Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages

(d)    The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, real estate, commodities, currencies, financial structures, Global Macro, REITS, private capital, and Risk Premia Capture.
(e)    Ending Money Market AUM includes
$69.4 billion
in institutional money market AUM and
$4.6 billion
in retail money market AUM.
(f)    As a result of fund mergers in the second quarter of 2011, the market gains and losses / reinvestment line includes $0.9 billion transferred from the balanced to the equity asset class.
(g)    The company acquired $114.6 billion in AUM at June 1, 2010 as part of the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. Other acquisitions during 2010 added $6.9 billion of AUM, net of minor dispositions related to the integration of the acquired business.
