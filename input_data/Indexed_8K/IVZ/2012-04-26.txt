Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the company's
first quarter 2012
compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages
7
through
12
of this release.
Net revenues
increased
by
$19.5 million
(
2.7%
) to
$736.3 million
in the
first quarter
from
$716.8 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. The change was principally due to increases in investment management fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
net revenues by
$2.0 million
when compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
.
Investment management fees, as adjusted,
increased
$41.3 million
(
5.4%
) to
$812.1 million
in the
first quarter
from
$770.8 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. The increase correlates with the higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
management fees by
$2.9 million
when compared to
fourth quarter 2011
.
2
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted,
increased
$7.9 million
(
4.4%
) to
$189.0 million
in the
first quarter
from
$181.1 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
, also reflecting the higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
management fees by
$0.4 million
when compared to
fourth quarter 2011
.
Performance fees, as adjusted, were
$21.2 million
in the
first quarter
compared to
$24.0 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. The first quarter fees were generated from certain investment trusts in the UK and real estate portfolios. Other revenues, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$11.8 million
(
26.3%
) in the
first quarter
to
$33.1 million
compared to
$44.9 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
principally due to lower transaction fees related to private equity and real estate activities.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were
$319.1 million
in the
first quarter
compared to
$304.0 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. The
increase
of
$15.1 million
(
5.0%
) primarily reflects the increase in investment management fees and service and distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
the
first quarter
third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by
$1.2 million
.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$6.6 million
(
1.4%
) to
$467.1 million
in the
first quarter
from
$460.5 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
operating expenses, as adjusted, by
$1.4 million
when compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
.
Employee compensation expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$0.7 million
(
0.2%
) to
$313.0 million
in the
first quarter
from
$312.3 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
. Seasonally higher payroll tax costs and retirement costs were offset by reduced variable compensation costs when compared to the fourth quarter 2011. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
employee compensation expenses by
$0.8 million
when compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$4.9 million
(
22.2%
) to
$27.0 million
in the
first quarter
from
$22.1 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
principally due to increased advertising spend in the UK and US. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
marketing expenses by
$0.1 million
when compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
.
Property, office and technology expenses, as adjusted,
increased
$4.4 million
(
7.1%
) to
$66.3 million
in the
first quarter
from
$61.9 million
in the
fourth quarter 2011
reflecting higher property lease expenses and continued investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
first quarter
property, office and technology expenses by
$0.3 million
when compared to the
fourth quarter 2011
.
General and administrative expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
$3.4 million
(

increased
to
25.1%
for the
first quarter
from
22.9%
for the
fourth quarter 2011
. The fourth quarter tax rate was lower than anticipated due to adjustments to tax positions to reflect actual tax returns filed.

Invesco Ltd.
Notes to the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statements to Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Income Statement Information
The following are notes to the reconciliations presented on pages
7
through
9
. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization (including any increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets), changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, and all related tax effects. Additionally, in the first quarter an acquisition related loan note gain of $3.5 million, recorded in other gains and losses, has been reclassified into equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to reflect the hedging purpose of the note. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
2. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, which are all closely linked to the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM but vary extensively by geography due to differences in distribution channels.  The non-GAAP presentation nets these costs against revenues to arrive at net revenues, which serves to reflect these costs as revenue sharing activities and to remove distortions caused by differing distribution channel fees.
3. Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments
The company has two joint ventures in China.  Enhancing operations in China is one effort that the company believes could improve its competitive position over time.  U.S. GAAP requires classification of
10
the pre-tax joint venture income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.  The non-GAAP adjustment proportionately consolidates these joint ventures, serving to illustrate the contribution of these joint ventures to the operations of the business.
Management and performance fees earned by the company, which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products, were
$10.4 million
in the
first quarter
(
fourth quarter 2011
:
$11.7 million
;
first quarter 2011
:
$11.1 million
). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management and performance fees are added back into net revenues. Similarly, the consolidated investment products' operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in an
increase
of
$4.2 million
in net income attributable to common shareholders in the
first quarter
U.S. GAAP earnings (
fourth quarter 2011
:
$1.9 million
;
first quarter 2011
:
$9.6 million
). The above adjustments remove this impact.
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market
appreciation
of the compensation liability was
$6.5 million
in the
first quarter
(
fourth quarter 2011
:
$5.5 million
appreciation
;
first quarter 2011
:
$4.1 million
appreciation
) with an investment
gain
, inclusive of interest and dividend income, of
$13.6 million
in the
first quarter
(
fourth quarter 2011
:
$10.1 million
gain
;
first quarter 2011
:
$5.2 million
gain
) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of
$2.0 million
in the
first quarter
(
fourth quarter 2011
:
$1.4 million
charge;
first quarter 2011
:
$0.4 million
charge), result in a net income
deduction
of
$5.1 million
for the
first quarter
(
fourth quarter 2011
:
$3.2 million
deduction
;
first quarter 2011
:
$0.7 million
deduction
).
11
Due to the unique character and magnitude of these items, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Footnotes to the Assets Under Management Tables
(a)
    
Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in the
first quarter
for our JVs in China was
$3.0 billion
(
fourth quarter
2011: $3.1 billion;
first quarter
2011: $3.5 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. The company evaluates net revenue yield instead. See the Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP information on pages
7
through
12
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(b)
    
Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages
7
through
12
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(c)    The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, Asian direct real estate, commodities, currencies, European direct real estate, financial structures, Global REITS, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, Risk Premia Capture, U.S.direct real estate, and U.S. REITS.
(d)    Ending Money Market AUM includes
$70.5 billion
in institutional money market AUM and
$4.0 billion
in retail money market AUM.
(e)    Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, non-fee earning leverage, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.
