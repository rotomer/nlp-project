Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $668.4 billion, a decrease of 0.7% month over month. During the month, the positive impact from foreign exchange of $2.3 billion was offset by total net outflows and market depreciation.  Total net long-term outflows were largely due to outflows of $2.6 billion in the Invesco PowerShares QQQ and a previously reported $0.9 billion active fixed income outflow from the UK. Total average assets for the quarter through April were $667.3 billion and average active assets for the quarter through April 30 were $556.3 billion.
