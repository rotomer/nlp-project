Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $632.1 billion, a decrease of 5.4% month over month. The decrease was largely the result of negative market returns and unfavorable foreign exchange.  FX decreased AUM by $7.1 billion in the month.   During the month, total net-long term flows were negative, driven largely by Passive outflows from the Powershares DB and Powershares QQQ products as well as a Stable Value client termination reported in Active fixed income.  Total average assets for the quarter through May 31 were $658.0 billion, and average active assets for the quarter through May 31 were $549.5 billion.
