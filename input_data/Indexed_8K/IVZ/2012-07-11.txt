Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management of $646.6 billion, an increase of 2.3% month over month. The increase was largely the result of positive market returns, foreign exchange, and long-term net inflows. For the month, FX increased AUM by $2.3 billion while active net-long term flows were flat. Preliminary total average assets for the quarter through June 30 were $651.2 billion, and preliminary average active assets for the quarter through June 30 were $542.9 billion.
Additionally, in the month of June the company completed the fund raising related to WLR Recovery Fund V. The customary revenue catch up payment resulting from the closure will be immaterial to the income statement for the quarter.
