Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the company's
second quarter 2012
compared to the
first quarter 2012
non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages
7
through
12
of this release.
Net revenues
decreased
by
$24.2 million
(
3.3%
) to
$712.1 million
in the
second quarter
from
$736.3 million
in the
first quarter 2012
. The change was principally due to decreases in investment management fees, performance fees and other revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
second quarter
net revenues by
$3.0 million
when compared to the
first quarter 2012
.
Investment management fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$10.0 million
(
1.2%
) to
$802.1 million
in the
second quarter
from
$812.1 million
in the
first quarter 2012
. The decrease is in line with the lower average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
second quarter
management fees by
$4.1 million
when compared to
first quarter 2012
.
2
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted,
decreased
$1.9 million
(
1.0%
) to
$187.1 million
in the
second quarter
from
$189.0 million
in the
first quarter 2012
, also reflecting the lower average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
second quarter
service and distribution fees by
$0.4 million
when compared to
first quarter 2012
.
Performance fees, as adjusted, were
$15.5 million
in the
second quarter
compared to
$21.2 million
in the
first quarter 2012
. The second quarter fees were generated principally from bank loan products. Other revenues, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$7.1 million
(
21.5%
) in the
second quarter
to
$26.0 million
, compared to
$33.1 million
in the
first quarter 2012
, principally due to lower transaction fees from real estate fund activities and reduced unit investment trust business sales.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were
$318.6 million
in the
second quarter
compared to
$319.1 million
in the
first quarter 2012
. Foreign exchange rate changes

the
second quarter
third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by
$1.6 million

in the
second quarter
from
$313.0 million
in the
first quarter 2012
. The first quarter included seasonally higher payroll tax costs and retirement costs that decreased in the second quarter. This expense reduction was partly offset by a full quarter of the annual salary increases and share-based awards, both effective from March 1. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
second quarter
employee compensation expenses by
$1.3 million
when compared to the
first quarter 2012
.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$0.2 million
(
0.7%
) to

in the
second quarter
from

in the
first quarter 2012
. Foreign exchange rate changes
decreased
second quarter
marketing expenses by
$0.2 million
when compared to the
first quarter 2012
.

(
2.3%
) to

first quarter 2012
. The second quarter included an increase in expenses associated with higher levels of regulatory compliance. Foreign exchange rate changes

.
Non-operating other income and expenses, as adjusted, included a 17.0% improvement in equity in earnings from partnership investments, increasing from $4.7 million in the first quarter 2012 to $5.5 million in the second quarter. Other gains and losses, net in the second quarter was a loss of $1.7 million and included a write down of $0.9 million on seed investments and foreign exchange losses on inter-group loans. The first quarter gain of $2.4 million included realized seed investments gains. The effective tax rate
decreased
to
24.5%
for the
second quarter
from
25.1%
for the
first quarter 2012
.
3
U.S. GAAP Earnings

Operating expenses also included $5.8 million of European infrastructure transformational initiative expenses for the second quarter compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter.
The effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests,
increased
to
28.8%
for the
second quarter
from
27.5%
for the
first quarter 2012
.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement Presentation
The company is presenting both a U.S. GAAP balance sheet and a balance sheet excluding consolidated investment products ("CIP"), along with a U.S. GAAP statement of cash flows and a statement of cash flows excluding consolidated investment products in this release. The financial statements excluding consolidated investment products are non-GAAP presentations. Balance sheet and cash flow statements before and after the consolidation of investment products are reconciled on pages 15 and
18
, respectively.
The company believes that, by excluding the consolidation of investment products, the non-GAAP balance sheet and statement of cash flows provide a more representative presentation of our financial risks and the company's cash and debt positions, allowing more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP presentations to evaluate the business and the presentations are consistent with internal management reporting. As demonstrated by the selected balance sheet data that follows, inclusion of the long-term debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures, such as debt-to-equity ratios, causes the company to appear to be far more indebted than is the case.
4
Balance Sheets and Capital Management
Selected balance sheet information is reflected in the table below:
As of June 30, 2012, the company's cash and cash equivalents were
$718.4 million
with total debt of
$1,341.6 million
. The credit facility balance was $811.0 million at
June 30, 2012
, compared to $580.0 million at
March 31, 2012
and $539.0 million at December 31, 2011.
During the second quarter the company repaid the $215.1 million of outstanding 5.625% Senior Notes, funding the repayment from the credit facility and existing cash balances. During the second quarter, the company also repurchased $75.0 million of its stock, representing 3.2 million shares at a weighted average share price of $23.30, bringing the total June 30, 2012 year-to-date stock repurchases to $150.0 million.
Dividends paid in the second quarter were $78.0 million bringing the total June 30, 2012 year-to-date cash dividends to $133.7 million. Today the company is announcing a
second-quarter
cash dividend of 17.25 cents per share to holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on September 7, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2012.
Headcount
As of
June 30, 2012
, the company had
6,141
employees, compared to
6,153
employees as of
March 31, 2012
.

Notes
Notes 1 through 8 relate to the income statement reconciliations presented on pages
10
through
12
. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Note 9 relates to the balance sheet and cash flow statement reconciliations on pages
15
and
18
, respectively.
Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization (including any increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets), changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, and all related tax effects. Additionally, in the first quarter 2012 an acquisition related loan note gain of $3.5 million, recorded in other gains and losses, has been reclassified into equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to reflect the hedging purpose of the note. Adjustment amounts are as follows:
2. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, which are all closely linked to the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM but vary extensively by geography due to differences in distribution channels.  The non-GAAP presentation nets these costs against revenues to arrive at net revenues, which serves to reflect these costs as revenue sharing activities and to remove distortions caused by differing distribution channel fees.
3. Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments
The company has two joint ventures in China.  Enhancing operations in China is one effort that the company believes could improve its competitive position over time.  U.S. GAAP requires classification of the pre-tax
19
joint venture income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.  The non-GAAP adjustment proportionately consolidates these joint ventures, serving to illustrate the contribution of these joint ventures to the operations of the business.
Management and performance fees earned by the company, which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products, were
$10.5 million
in the
second quarter
(
first quarter 2012
:
$10.4 million
;
second quarter 2011
:
$12.2 million
). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management and performance fees are added back into net revenues. Similarly, the consolidated investment products' operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in a
decrease
of
$6.2 million
in net income attributable to common shareholders in the
second quarter
U.S. GAAP earnings (
first quarter 2012
:
$4.2 million
increase;
second quarter 2011
:
$5.2 million
increase). The above adjustments remove this impact.
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market
depreciation
of the compensation liability was
$0.2 million
in the
second quarter
(
first quarter 2012
:
$6.5 million
appreciation
;
second quarter 2011
:
$2.5 million
appreciation
) with an investment
loss
, inclusive of interest and dividend income, of
$3.8 million
in the
second quarter
(
first quarter 2012
:
$13.6 million
gain
;
second quarter 2011
:
$4.5 million
gain
) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of
$1.2 million
in the
second quarter
(
first quarter 2012
:
$2.0 million
charge;
second quarter 2011
:
$0.5 million
charge), result in a net income
addition
of
$2.4 million
for the
second quarter
(
first quarter 2012
:
$5.1 million
deduction
;
second quarter 2011
:
$1.5 million
deduction
).
Due to the unique character and magnitude of these items, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
20
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
U.S. GAAP condensed consolidating balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows reflect the consolidation of investment products, including the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances were CLO related as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. Similarly, cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products.
By deconsolidating the consolidated investment products in the condensed consolidated balance sheets excluding consolidated investment products, the assets, liabilities and equity of the consolidated investment products are removed and the company's equity interest in the investment products, accounted for as equity method and available-for-sale investments, are replaced. The company considers this a more representative presentation of the company's financial position, and calculations made therefrom, such as debt-to-equity ratios, are more meaningful excluding these balances.
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows excluding consolidated investment products present the cash flows of the company separately and before consolidation of investment products, as the cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted.

Footnotes to the Assets Under Management Tables
(a)
    
Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the
second quarter
for our JVs in China was
$3.1 billion
(
first quarter
2012: $3.0 billion;
second quarter
2011: $3.5 billion). For year to date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the first six months of 2012 for our JVs in China was
$3.0 billion
(first six months of 2011: $3.5 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. The company evaluates net revenue yield instead. See the Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP information on pages
10
through
12
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(b)
    
Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages
10
through
12
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(c)    The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, Asian direct real estate, commodities, currencies, European direct real estate, financial structures, Global REITS, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, Risk Premia Capture, U.S.direct real estate, and U.S. REITS.
(d)    Ending Money Market AUM includes
$67.0 billion
in institutional money market AUM and
$4.0 billion
in retail money market AUM.
(e)    Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, non-fee earning leverage, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.
