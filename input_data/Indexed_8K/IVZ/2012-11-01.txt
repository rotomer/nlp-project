--- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported financial results for the three months ended
September 30, 2012
.
"Invesco's continued focus on providing strong, long-term investment performance to our clients contributed to total net inflows of $11.7 billion for the quarter, one of the strongest quarterly net flows results in our history, said Martin L.

Assets Under Management
Total assets under management (AUM) at
September 30, 2012
, were
$683.0 billion
(
June 30, 2012

),
an increase
of
$36.4 billion
during the
third quarter
. Total net inflows were
$11.7 billion
for the
third quarter
as detailed below:
Net market gains led to a
$22.1 billion

, compared to a $15.5 billion decrease in the
second quarter 2012
. The third quarter included a previously disclosed disposition of $1.7 billion of AUM related to certain European collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs). Foreign exchange rate movements led to a
$4.3 billion
increase
in AUM during the
third quarter
, compared to a $2.4 billion decrease in the
second quarter 2012
.
Average AUM during the
third quarter
were $

. Further analysis is included in the supplementary schedules to this release.
Earnings Summary
The company is presenting both U.S. GAAP earnings information and non-GAAP earnings information in this release. The company believes that the additional disclosure of non-GAAP earnings, as described more fully in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, provides further transparency into the business and allows more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting.
Non-GAAP Earnings
This section discusses the company's
third quarter 2012
compared to the
second quarter 2012
non-GAAP financial results. The phrase as adjusted is used in the following earnings discussion to identify non-GAAP information, together with the non-GAAP financial measures of net revenues, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP items are reconciled to these non-GAAP items on pages
7
through
12
of this release.
Net revenues
increased
by
$22.6 million
(
3.2%
) to
$734.7 million
in the
third quarter
from
$712.1 million
in the
second quarter 2012
. The change was principally due to increases in investment management fees and service and distribution fees as a result of higher average AUM and an improved net revenue yield. These increases were partly offset by reduced performance fee revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
third quarter
net revenues by
$3.2 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2012
.
Investment management fees, as adjusted,
increased
$37.8 million
(
4.7%
) to
$839.9 million
in the
third quarter
from
$802.1 million
in the
second quarter 2012
. The increase is in line with the higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
third quarter
management fees by
$4.3 million
when
2
compared to
second quarter 2012
.
Service and distribution fees, as adjusted,
increased
$9.0 million
(
4.8%
) to
$196.1 million
in the
third quarter
from
$187.1 million
in the
second quarter 2012
, also reflecting the higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes

third quarter
service and distribution fees by
$0.4 million
when compared to
second quarter 2012
.
Performance fees, as adjusted, were
$3.4 million
in the
third quarter
compared to
$15.5 million

second quarter 2012
. Other revenues, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$1.6 million
(
6.2%
) in the
third quarter
to
$24.4 million
, compared to
$26.0 million
in the
second quarter 2012
, principally due to lower transaction fees from real estate fund activities.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, as adjusted, were
$329.1 million
in the
third quarter
compared to
$318.6 million
in the
second quarter 2012
, increasing in line with higher management fees and service and distribution fees. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
the
third quarter
third-party distribution, services and advisory expenses by
$1.7 million
.
Total operating expenses, as adjusted,
increased
by
$21.2 million
(
4.6%
) to
$484.3 million
in the
third quarter
from

in the
second quarter 2012
primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses. Foreign exchange rate changes

in the
third quarter
from
$306.5 million
in the
second quarter 2012
. The increase in the third quarter includes $12.0 million of additional variable compensation stemming from strong investment performance. This adjustment to year end award estimates includes $8.0 million that can be attributed to the first half of 2012, and $4.0 million attributable to the third quarter. In addition, compensation expenses in the third quarter included increased commissions driven by strong sales and flows, and increases in medical insurance and relocation costs. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
third quarter
employee compensation expenses by
$1.5 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2012
.
Marketing expenses, as adjusted,
decreased
by
$0.3 million
(
1.1%
) to
$26.5 million
in the
third quarter
from
$26.8 million
in the

(
2.2%
) to
$69.3 million
in the
third quarter
from
$67.8 million
in the
second quarter 2012
. The third quarter included increases in technology expenses associated with continued investment in fixed income trading, portfolio management and risk reporting systems. These increases were partly offset by reduced rent; the second quarter included a $1.7 million rent exit charge on leased space. Foreign exchange rate changes
increased
third quarter
property, office and technology expenses by
$0.2 million
when compared to the
second quarter 2012
.

decreased
$1.2 million
(
1.9%
) to
$60.8 million
in the
third quarter
from

in the
second quarter 2012
. Foreign exchange rate changes had no significant impact on
third quarter

second quarter 2012
.

3
investments of $1.6 million in the
third quarter
compared to $5.5 million in the
second quarter 2012
. Other gains and losses, net in the
third quarter
were $9.5 million reflecting realized gains on a variety of equity interests, compared to a second quarter loss of $1.7 million. The effective tax rate
increased
to
25.8%
for the
third quarter
from
24.5%
for the
second quarter 2012
.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement Presentation
The company is presenting both a U.S. GAAP balance sheet and a balance sheet excluding consolidated investment products, along with a U.S. GAAP statement of cash flows and a statement of cash flows excluding consolidated investment products in this release. The financial statements excluding consolidated investment products are non-GAAP presentations. Balance sheet and cash flow statements before and after the consolidation of investment products are reconciled on pages 15 and
18
, respectively.
The company believes that, by excluding the consolidation of investment products, the non-GAAP balance sheet and statement of cash flows provide a more representative presentation of our financial risks and the company's cash and debt positions, allowing more appropriate comparisons with our industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP presentations to evaluate the business and the presentations are consistent with internal management reporting. As demonstrated by the selected balance sheet data that follows, inclusion of the long-term debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures, such as debt-to-equity ratios, causes the company to appear to be far more indebted than is the case.
4
Balance Sheets and Capital Management
Selected balance sheet information is reflected in the table below:
As of
September 30, 2012
, the company's cash and cash equivalents were

September 30, 2012
, compared to $811.0 million at
June 30, 2012
and $539.0 million at December 31, 2011.
During the
third quarter
, the company repurchased $40.0 million of its stock, representing 1.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $22.16, bringing the total
September 30, 2012
year-to-date stock repurchases to $190.0 million.
Dividends paid in the
third quarter
were $77.8 million bringing the total
September 30, 2012
year-to-date cash dividends to $211.5 million. Today the company is announcing a
third-quarter
cash dividend of 17.25 cents per share to holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on
December 7, 2012
, to shareholders of record at the close of business on
November 19, 2012
.

Notes
Notes 1 through 8 relate to the income statement reconciliations presented on pages
10
through
12
. Further explanations of the reasons the company considers it appropriate to present these adjustments in arriving at the non-GAAP measures can be found in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Note 9 relates to the balance sheet and cash flow statement reconciliations on pages
15
and
18
, respectively.
Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Acquisition related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations, including transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization (including any increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets), changes in estimates of acquisition earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, and all related tax effects.
Included in other gains and losses, net in the third quarter of 2012 is a gain of $8.3 million related to the sale of the management contracts for certain European CLOs. To aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar disposition-related gains, this gain and the associated taxation have been excluded in arriving at the company's non-GAAP results.
Adjustment related to acquisition and disposition amounts are as follows:
2. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, which are all closely linked to the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM but vary extensively by geography due to differences in distribution channels.  The non-GAAP presentation nets these costs against revenues to arrive at net revenues, which serves to reflect these costs as revenue sharing activities and to remove distortions caused by differing distribution channel fees.
3. Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments
The company has two joint ventures in China.  Enhancing operations in China is one effort that the company believes could improve its competitive position over time.  U.S. GAAP requires classification of the pre-tax joint venture income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.  The non-GAAP adjustment
19
proportionately consolidates these joint ventures, serving to illustrate the contribution of these joint ventures to the operations of the business.
Management and performance fees earned by the company, which were eliminated from operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products, were
$11.5 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2012
:
$10.5 million
;
third quarter 2011
:
$12.3 million
). By deconsolidating these products in the non-GAAP information, the management and performance fees are added back into net revenues. Similarly, the consolidated investment products' operating expenses and impact on interest income, interest expense, gains and losses, and noncontrolling interests are removed in reconciling from the U.S. GAAP income statement to the non-GAAP information. The consolidation of the investment products resulted in a
decrease
of
$11.1 million
in net income attributable to common shareholders in the
third quarter
U.S. GAAP earnings (
second quarter 2012
:
$6.2 million
decrease;
third quarter 2011
:
$3.5 million
increase). The above adjustments remove this impact.
This adjustment relates to deferred cash compensation that is linked in value to investment products. The market
appreciation
of the compensation liability was
$4.7 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2012
:
$0.2 million
depreciation
;
third quarter 2011
:
$6.3 million
depreciation
) with an investment
gain
, inclusive of interest and dividend income, of
$11.1 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2012
:
$3.8 million
loss
;
third quarter 2011
:
$17.6 million
loss
) on the assets held to hedge economically the compensation liability. This change in compensation expense and the investment income are adjusted in arriving at the non-GAAP information and, net of the applicable taxation charge of
$1.9 million
in the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2012
:
$1.2 million
credit;
third quarter 2011
:
$3.4 million
credit), result in a net income
deduction
of
$4.5 million
for the
third quarter
(
second quarter 2012
:
$2.4 million
addition
;
third quarter 2011
:
$7.9 million
addition
).
20
company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $4.0 million in the third quarter 2011 relating to the credit. Due to the unique character and magnitude of this credit, its impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures. Due to the unique character and magnitude of these items, their impact has been excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
U.S. GAAP condensed consolidating balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows reflect the consolidation of investment products, including the adoption of guidance now encompassed in ASC Topic 810 on January 1, 2010. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances were CLO-related as of
September 30, 2012
and December 31, 2011. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. Similarly, cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products.
By deconsolidating the consolidated investment products in the condensed consolidated balance sheets excluding consolidated investment products, the assets, liabilities and equity of the consolidated investment products are removed and the company's equity interest in the investment products, accounted for as equity method and available-for-sale investments, are replaced. The company considers this a more representative presentation of the company's financial position, and calculations made therefrom, such as debt-to-equity ratios, are more meaningful excluding these balances.
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows excluding consolidated investment products present the cash flows of the company separately and before consolidation of investment products, as the cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted.

Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the
third quarter
for our JVs in China was
$2.9 billion
(
second quarter
2012: $3.1 billion;
third quarter
2011: $3.3 billion). For year to date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the nine months of 2012 for our JVs in China was
$3.0 billion
(nine months of 2011: $3.4 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. The company evaluates net revenue yield instead. See the Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP information on p
ages 10 through
12
of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(b)
    
Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages 10 through
12
of this release for a reconciliation
of operating revenues to net revenues.
(c)    The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, Asian direct real estate, commodities, currencies, European direct real estate, financial structures, Global REITS, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, Risk Premia Capture, U.S.direct real estate, and U.S. REITS.
(d)    Ending Money Market AUM includes
$69.3 billion
in institutional money market AUM and
$3.9 billion
in retail money market AUM.
(e)    Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, non-fee earning leverage, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.
