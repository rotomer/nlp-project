Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuer and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer or the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, each director of the Issuer, each officer of the Issuer who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuer and each director of a Guarantor, each officer of a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls a Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Schedule A
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(c) unless otherwise provided in any Supplemental Indenture, any Guarantor by the Company, any other Guarantor, the Trustee or any Holder shall be sufficient for any purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing, and mailed, first class postage prepaid, to such Guarantor addressed to it c/o Invesco Ltd., 1555 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30309, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or sent by facsimile to such Guarantor at (404) 962-8357 (with receipt confirmed by telephone at (404) 479-2945), or at any other address or facsimile number previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by such Guarantor.
 
The Trustee agrees to accept and act upon instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by unsecured e-mail, facsimile transmission or other similar unsecured electronic methods; provided, however, that (a) the party providing such written instructions, subsequent to such transmission of written instructions, shall provide the originally executed instructions or directions to the Trustee in a timely manner, and (b) such originally executed instructions or directions shall be signed by an authorized representative of the party providing such instructions or directions. If a party elects to give the Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, the Trustee's understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee's reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, as long as the Securities are in the form of a Global Security, notice to the Holders may be made electronically in accordance with procedures of the Depositary.
Section 1.06 Notice to Holders, Waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Any notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event to Holders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice for every purpose hereunder.
 
Section 1.07 Conflict of any Provision of Indenture with Trust Indenture Act.
If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act, or conflicts with any provision (an "incorporated provision") required by or deemed to be included in this Indenture by operation of such Trust Indenture Act sections, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control.

The Company and each Guarantor agree that any suit, action or proceeding against the Company or any Guarantor arising out of or based upon this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any State or Federal court in The City of New York, New York, and waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding. The Company and each Guarantor has appointed CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011 as its authorized agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this Indenture, any Security or the transactions contemplated herein or thereby which may be instituted in any State or Federal court in The City of New York, New York, and expressly accepts the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company and each Guarantor further agree to take any and all action as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect for a period of ten years from the date of this Indenture. If for any reason CT Corporation System shall cease to be available to act as such authorized agent for the Company and any Guarantor, the Company and each Guarantor agree to designate a new agent in the State of New York on the terms and for the purpose of this Section 1.15. The Company and each Guarantor hereby represent and warrant that the Authorized Agent has accepted such appointment and has agreed to act as said agent for service of process, and the Company and each Guarantor agree to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company.
To the extent that the Company or any Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from jurisdiction of any court or from set off or any legal process (whether service of notice, attachment in aid of or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Indenture, any Securities or the Guarantees, as applicable.
EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE GUARANTORS AND THE TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE SECURITIES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
 
Section 1.16 Currency.
(a) Each reference in this Indenture to U.S. dollars (the "relevant currency") is of the essence. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligation of the Company in respect of any amount due with respect to the Securities of any series or any other obligation under this Indenture will, notwithstanding any payment in any other currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the relevant currency that the party entitled to receive such payment may, in accordance with its normal procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other currency (after any premium and costs of exchange) on the Business Day immediately following the day on which such party receives such payment. If the amount in the relevant currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company will pay such additional amounts, in the relevant currency, as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. Any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, will continue in full force and effect.
(b) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify each Holder against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company or any of the Guarantors, for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Indenture and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in the City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such judgment or order is able to purchase U.S. dollars with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such party if such party had utilized such amount of Judgment Currency to purchase U.S. dollars as promptly as practicable upon such party's receipt thereof. The foregoing indemnity shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term "spot rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, U.S. dollars.
Section 2.01 Forms Generally.
Each Security in a series shall be in a form approved by or pursuant to a Supplemental Indenture hereto or a Board Resolution or by an Officer or Officers pursuant to authority delegated to that Officer or those Officers pursuant to a Board Resolution. If the form of the Securities of a series is not prescribed by the Supplemental Indenture relating to that series, upon or prior to the delivery to the Trustee for authentication of the first Security to be issued of that series, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, the Board Resolution by or pursuant to which such form of the Security for that series has been approved, which Board Resolution shall have
 
attached thereto a copy of the form of the Security approved, or a certificate of an Officer, attested to by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company, certifying that an Officer, acting pursuant to delegated authority from the Board of Directors, approved the form of the Securities of that series and attaching a copy of the form of the Security and a true and complete copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors delegating authority to that Officer to approve the form of Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form as permitted by Section 3.04, the form thereof also shall be established as provided in this Section 2.01.
All Securities shall have such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of the Securities. Any portion of the text of any Security may be set forth on the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on the face of the Security.
The definitive Securities of any series shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel-engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the officers of the Company executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
Section 2.02 Global Securities.
If Securities of a series are issuable in whole or in part in global form, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 (a "Global Security"), then, notwithstanding Section 3.01 and the provisions of Section 3.02, such Global Security shall represent such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified in such Global Security and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased to reflect exchanges or partial redemptions or increased to reflect the issuance of additional uncertificated Securities of that series. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities of a series represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.03. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.03, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Global Security in the manner and upon written instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 3.03 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Global Security shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 1.02.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for the Securities evidenced thereby, every Global Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form on the face thereof:
UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC"), TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC OR SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
TRANSFERS OF THIS GLOBAL SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF CEDE & CO. OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE AND TRANSFERS OF PORTIONS OF THIS GLOBAL SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.06 OF THE INDENTURE.

All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for issuances of additional Securities of such series.
If any of the terms of any series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of such series.
Section 3.02 Denominations.
The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, only in denominations of US$2,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
Section 3.03 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities of each series shall be executed on behalf of the Company by any authorized officer of the Company. The Guarantees endorsed thereon shall be executed on behalf of each Guarantor by any authorized officer of each Guarantor. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities or the Guarantees may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities and the Guarantees.
Securities or Guarantees bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company or the applicable Guarantor shall bind the Company or the Guarantor, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities directing the Trustee to authenticate the Securities and certifying that all conditions precedent to the issuance of Securities contained herein have been fully complied with, and the Trustee in accordance with such Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel of the Company that it may reasonably request in connection with such authentication of any Securities of any series. Such order shall specify the amount of Securities of such series to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities of such series.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
In case the Company, pursuant to Article VIII, shall be consolidated or merged with or into any other Person or shall convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, and the successor Person resulting from such consolidation, or surviving such merger, or into which the Company shall have been merged, or the Person which shall have received a conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition as aforesaid, shall have executed a Supplemental Indenture with the Trustee pursuant to Article VIII, any of the Securities of any series authenticated or delivered prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition may, from time to time, at the request of the successor Person, be exchanged for other Securities of such series executed in the name of the successor Person with such changes in phraseology and form as may be appropriate, but otherwise in substance of like tenor as the Securities of such series surrendered for such exchange and of like principal amount; and the Trustee, upon Company Request of the successor Person, shall authenticate and deliver Securities as specified in such request for the purpose of such exchange. If Securities of any series shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in any new name of a successor Person pursuant to this Section in exchange or substitution for or upon registration of transfer of any Securities of such series, such successor Person, at the option of the Holders but without expense to them, shall provide for the exchange of all Securities of such series at the time Outstanding for Securities of such series authenticated and delivered in such new name.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Section 3.13 duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.10 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued or sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.04 Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company and the Guarantors may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities having duly executed Guarantees endorsed thereon, which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities and Guarantees may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company and the Guarantors will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.02, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company and the Guarantors shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of such series having Guarantees duly endorsed thereon of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
Section 3.05 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency designated pursuant to Section 10.02 being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities of each series and of transfers of Securities of such series. The Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times, the Security Register shall be open to inspection by the Trustee. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as "Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 10.02, the Company and the Guarantors shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series having duly executed Guarantees for such series endorsed thereon of any authorized denomination for such series or denominations of a like aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of such series of any authorized denomination for such series and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities of any series are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities of any series and any Guarantees thereof issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company and any Guarantor, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities of such series and Guarantees thereof surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06 or 11.08 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the selection of Securities to be redeemed under Section 11.04 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfer between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
Section 3.06 Book-Entry Provisions for Restricted Global Security.
(a) Any Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of the Depositary, (ii) be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Depositary or with the Trustee, as custodian for such Depositary, and (iii) bear legends as set forth in Section 2.02.
The Depositary or its nominee shall be the Holder of the Global Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in the Securities represented by the Global Securities shall hold such interests pursuant to the procedures and practices of the Depositary. Any such owner's beneficial ownership of any such Securities will be shown only on, and the transfer of such ownership interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee. All interests in a Global Security may be subject to the procedures and requirements of the Depositary. Those interests held through Euroclear and Clearstream will be subject to the procedures and requirements of such system.
(b) Transfers of any Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in any Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.
Unless (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for a Global Security or ceases to be a "Clearing Agency" registered under the Exchange Act or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) an Event of Default has
 
occurred and is continuing with respect to a Global Security or (iii) Company determines that the Global Securities (in whole or in part) should be exchanged for definitive Securities; provided that (x) such exchange is required by (A) any applicable law or (B) any event beyond the Company's control or (y) payments of interest on any Global Security, or beneficial interest are, or would become, subject to any deduction or withholding for taxes, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to have any portions of such Global Security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the Global Security.
(c) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (b) of this Section shall be issued in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, shall be of the same series and have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear any legends required hereunder. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery the Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof. In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in the last sentence of subsection (b) of this Section 3.06, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Securities of such series in definitive form.
(d) Except as otherwise set forth in this Indenture or a Global Security, owners of beneficial interests in the Securities evidenced by a Global Security will not be entitled to any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and the Depositary or its nominee may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any such agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or its nominee or impair, as between the Depositary or its nominee and such owners of beneficial interests, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary or its nominee as Holder of any Security.
Section 3.07 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security of any series is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company and any Guarantor thereof shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of such series having a duly executed Guarantee, if applicable, endorsed thereon, of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company, any Guarantor and the Trustee (1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security of any series and (2) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of written notice to the Company, any Guarantor or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company and any Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of such series having a duly executed Guarantee, if applicable, endorsed thereon, of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security, and the Guarantee, if any, endorsed thereon, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series, and any Guarantees endorsed thereon, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.08 Payment of Interest; Rights to Interest Preserved.
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to Securities of a series, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.02 or, at the option of the Company, interest may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to 3.09 as such address appears in the Security Register; that all payments with respect to Securities of any series, the Holders of which have given wire transfer instructions to the Trustee (or other Paying Agent) by the Regular Record Date shall be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof.
provided
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date therefor shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such
 
Holder, and such defaulted interest and (to the extent lawful) interest on such defaulted interest at the rate borne by such Securities (such defaulted interest and interest thereon herein collectively called "Defaulted Interest") may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
(a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest payable on any Securities of a series to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in Section 1.06, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so given, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
(b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities of a series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.09 Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to the due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, each Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, such Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.08), interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any agent of the Company, such Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any depository, as a Holder, with respect to such Global Security or impair, as between such depository and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depository (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Security.
Section 3.10 Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures.
Section 3.11 CUSIP and CINS Numbers.
The Company in issuing any Securities may use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on such Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on such Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers in such notices of redemption.
Section 3.12 Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, interest on Securities any series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
Section 3.13 Form of Certificate of Authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for below duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Section 4.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Request (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of such series herein expressly provided for) and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series when:
(a) Either:
(i) all the Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities that have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.07 and Securities that have been subject to defeasance under Article XII) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(ii) all Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
 
 
 
 
and the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, in the case of (A), (B) or (C) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in trust for the purpose in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to such Securities of such Series to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities of such series that have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions directing the Trustee to apply the funds to the payment of the Securities of such series at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(b) the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable hereunder by the Company in respect of such series of Securities; and

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.07 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (ii) of clause (a) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last paragraph of Section 10.03 shall survive.
In the event that there are Securities of two or more series outstanding hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of a particular series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met.
Section 4.02 Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 or Article XII shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal of and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

provided

provided
(f) any Guarantee of any Security of that series is determined to be unenforceable or invalid or shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect, except as permitted by this Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture, or any Guarantor repudiates its obligations under such Guarantee; or
(g) any other event or occurrence that is designated to be an Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series in the Supplemental Indenture or Board Resolution that establishes the terms of the Securities of that series.
Section 5.02 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default (other than as specified in Section 5.01(d) or (e)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each such affected series may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Outstanding Securities of that series immediately due and payable by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders) and, upon any such declaration, all such amounts will become due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(d) or (e) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal amount of all of the Securities Outstanding of that series shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of Securities of that series.
At any time after a declaration of acceleration and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its consequences with respect to Securities of such series if:
(a) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(i) all overdue interest on and additional amounts with respect to all Outstanding Securities of that series,
 
(ii) all principal of any Outstanding Securities of that series that has become due other than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities of that series,
(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue interest, any additional amounts and overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities of that series, and
(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(b) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of or interest or any additional amounts on the Securities of that series that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.03 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company and each Guarantor, if any, covenants that if:
(a) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security of any series when such interest shall have become due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days; or
(b) default is made in the payment of the principal of any Security of any series at the Maturity thereof;
the Company and each Guarantor will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities of such series, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, and interest on any overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installment of interest, at the rate borne by such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company or any Guarantor of such Securities, as the case may be, fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company, such Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, any such Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Nothing in this Section shall be considered to require the Trustee to institute any judicial proceeding.
Section 5.04 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series (including any Guarantor) or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of such series and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities of such series allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other securities or property payable or deliverable upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07.
Nothing in this Section shall be considered to require the Trustee to take any of the actions described in this Section 5.04.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of Securities of any series any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any such Holder in any such proceeding.
 
Section 5.05 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 5.06 Application of Money Collected.
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal and interest, upon presentation of the Securities of any series and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07;
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and interest on such Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company and/or the Guarantors, as the case may be.
Section 5.07 Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Securities of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

(d) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
(e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority or more in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Securities of that series shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of that series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders of Securities of that series or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Securities of that series.
Section 5.08 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment, as provided herein (including, if applicable, Article XII) and in such Security of the principal of, and (subject to Section 3.08) interest on, such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 5.09 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture with respect to any Security of any series and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, any Guarantor of Securities of that series, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of that series shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 5.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.07, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 5.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
Section 5.12 Control by Holders.
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; that:
provided
(a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
(b) the Trustee shall have been given reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and
(c) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
Section 5.13 Waiver of Past Defaults.

(a) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security of such series, or
(b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security Outstanding of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.14 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company and each Guarantor covenant (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company and each Guarantor (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
Section 5.15 Undertaking for Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
Section 6.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

Section 12.02 Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 12.01 of the option applicable to this Section 12.02 with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities of such series on the date the conditions set forth in Section 12.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 12.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (A) and (B) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.07 and 10.03, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, and (D) this Article XII.

Upon the Company's exercise under Section 12.01 of the option applicable to this Section 12.03 with respect to the Securities of any series, each of the Company and the Guarantors shall be released from their obligations under any covenant contained in Section 8.01 and in Sections 10.05 through 10.09, inclusive, and, if specified pursuant to Section 3.01, their obligations under any other covenant, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and the Securities of such series shall thereafter be deemed not to be "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series, the Company and any Subsidiary may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01(c) with respect to Securities of such series but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
 
Section 12.04 Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

(d) In the case of an election under Section 12.02, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (i) the Holders and beneficial owners of the Securities of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance or such deposit and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case had such defeasance and deposit not occurred, and (ii) either (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the United States Internal Revenue Service, a ruling to that effect, or (B) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law;

(f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United Kingdom to the effect that (i) the Holders and beneficial owners of the Securities of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United Kingdom tax purposes either as a result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, or such deposit, and will be subject to United Kingdom tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case had such defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, and such deposit not occurred and (ii) payments under or with respect to the Securities of the applicable series and any Guarantees thereof will not become subject to withholding or deduction of United Kingdom tax either as a result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, or such deposit;
(g) If at such time the Securities of the applicable series are listed on a national securities exchange, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Securities will not be delisted as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under Section 12.02; and
(h) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the defeasance under Section 12.02 or the covenant defeasance under Section 12.03, as the case may be, have been complied with.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company and the Guarantors in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.01.
 
Section 12.05 Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 12.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 12.04 in respect of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Governmental Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 12.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series.
Anything in this Article XII to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 12.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
Section 12.06 Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 12.05 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.02 or 12.03, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 12.05;, , that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or interest on any Security of any series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Section 13.01 Unconditional Guarantee.
Subject to the provisions of this Article XIII, the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee (such guarantees to be referred to herein as "Guarantees") to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities of any series or the obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and interest on the Securities of such series shall be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption at the option of Holders pursuant to the provisions of the series of any Securities relating thereto, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, with respect to the Securities of such series and all other obligations of the Company or the Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder (including amounts due the Trustee hereunder) and all other Obligations shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of Securities of any series or any of such other Obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other Obligation of the Company to the Holders under this Indenture or under the Securities of such series, for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Securities of any applicable series shall constitute an event of default under the Guarantees, and shall entitle the Holders of Securities to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to Section 3.01, the Guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors.
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities of any series or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of Securities of such series with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Security, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. The Guarantors hereby waive the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that the Guarantees shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Securities, this Indenture and this Guarantee. This Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of such Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article XIII, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article V hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article V hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.
 
The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would otherwise have reduced the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder (whether such payment shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of the Guarantors) is rescinded or reclaimed from any of the Holders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, all such indebtedness otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors as provided herein.
Section 13.02 Limitations on Guarantees.
The obligations of the Guarantors under their Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantors (including without limitation, any other Guarantor senior debt) will result in the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law.
Section 13.03 Execution and Delivery of Guarantees.
The Guarantees set forth in Section 13.01 shall be evidenced by an endorsement, in a form approved by or pursuant to a Supplement Indenture or a Board Resolution, on each Security of a series authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. Such Guarantees shall be executed on behalf of the Guarantors by either manual of facsimile signature of an officer of each Guarantor who shall have been duly authorized to so execute by all requisite corporation action.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Security to be signed manually or by facsimile by its duly authorized officer.
 
 
 
(Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication)
This is one of the 3.125% Senior Notes due 2022 designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture (as supplemented by the within mentioned First Supplemental Indenture).
 
 
 
The Company will pay the principal of this Security on November 30, 2022.
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security on each Interest Payment Date, as set forth below, at the rate of 3.125% per annum.
Interest will be payable semiannually (to the holders of record of the Securities (or any predecessor Securities) at the close of business on the Regular Record Date) on each Interest Payment Date, commencing May 30, 2013.
Interest on this Security will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on this Security or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issue; that, if there is no existing default in the payment of interest and if this Security is authenticated between a Regular Record Date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such Interest Payment Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
provided
Under certain circumstances described in the Indenture, the Company or the Guarantors also shall pay Additional Amounts to the Holders of Securities.
The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and interest on overdue installments of interest and Additional Amounts, to the extent lawful, at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the Securities.
 
The Company will pay interest (except defaulted interest) on the principal amount of the Securities on each May 30 and November 30 to the persons who are Holders (as reflected in the Security Register at the close of business on the May 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date, whether or not such May 15 or November 15 is a Business Day), in each case, even if the Security is cancelled on registration of transfer or registration of exchange after such record date; that, with respect to the payment of principal, the Company will make payment to the Holder that surrenders this Security to any Paying Agent on or after November 30, 2022.
provided

Payment of the principal of, interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of New York (which shall be located at 101 Barclay Street, 8W, New York, NY 10286, Attention: Corporate Trust Department, unless the Company shall designate and maintain some other office or agency for such purpose), in lawful money of the United States of America, or payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security Register; that all payments to Holders who have given wire transfer instructions to the Trustee (or other Paying Agent) by the Regular Record Date for such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by such Holder. If a payment date is a date other than a Business Day at a place of payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.
provided, however,
 
Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar upon written notice thereto. The Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of them may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar. No Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar shall be located in a jurisdiction that requires payments relating to the Notes to be made subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes imposed by that jurisdiction.
 
This Security is entitled to the benefits of the Guarantee made by each of the Guarantors as described in the Indenture, pursuant to which the Guarantors have irrevocably, fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis the punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under the Indenture and this Security. A Guarantor shall be released from its Guarantee upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of November 8, 2012 as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 8, 2012 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors named therein (the "Guarantors" which term will include all successor guarantors under the Indenture) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"). Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Security and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control.
The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.
 
(a) Subject to Section 4.1 of the First Supplemental Indenture, in the event that the Company has become or would become obligated to pay any Additional Amounts as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of a Tax Jurisdiction, or any change in or amendment to the official application, administration or interpretation of these laws, regulations or published tax rulings, which change or amendment was not announced before, and becomes effective on or after, November 5, 2012 (or, in the case of any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of any jurisdiction that becomes a Tax Jurisdiction after November 5, 2012, which change or amendment was not announced before, and becomes effective on or after, the date such jurisdiction becomes a Tax Jurisdiction), then the Company may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Securities at any time at 100% of the principal amount thereof on the Redemption Date, together with accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon to but excluding the Redemption Date. Prior to the publication of the notice of redemption in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel.
(b) The Securities may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) on such Securities to be redeemed discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon to but excluding the Redemption Date; that interest installments due on an Interest Payment Date which is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to Holders who are Holders of record of such Securities as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date preceding such Interest Payment Date.
provided, however,
(c) Notice of a redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's last address as it appears in the Security Register. Securities in original denominations larger than US$2,000 may be redeemed in part in integral multiples of US$1,000. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price.
 
The Securities are in registered form without coupons, in denominations of US$2,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer or exchange of Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities selected for redemption (except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part). Also, it need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed is made.
 
As long as the Securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other exchange as meets the definition of a "recognised stock exchange" within the meaning of section 1005 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007), to the extent required by that exchange, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the New York Stock Exchange and publicize such redemption in accordance with any such requirements of such exchange.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantors or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its request. After that, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment, unless an abandoned property law designates another Person, and all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.
 
Provided other conditions in the Indenture are met, if the Company irrevocably deposits, or causes to be deposited, with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the then outstanding principal of, accrued interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities to redemption or maturity, the Company will be discharged from the Indenture and the Securities, except in certain circumstances for certain sections thereof.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding, and any existing default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding. Without notice to or the consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, make changes that comply with rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities may be listed or traded and make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.
 
The Indenture contains certain covenants, including, without limitation, covenants with respect to the merger and certain transfers of assets. Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Company must report to the Trustee on compliance with such covenants.
 
When a successor person or other entity expressly assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor person will be released from those obligations, provided other conditions in the Indenture are met.
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may declare all the Securities to be immediately due and payable. If a bankruptcy or insolvency default with respect to the Company or any Guarantor occurs and is continuing, the Securities automatically become immediately due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.
 
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may make loans to, accept deposits from, perform services for, and otherwise deal with, the Company and its Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee.
 
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian) and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to INVESCO FINANCE PLC, 1555 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite 1800, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.

The opinions rendered in paragraphs 1 and 2 below relating to the enforceability of the Indenture and the Securities are subject to the effects of: (i) bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation, conservatorship, and similar laws, and limitations imposed under judicial decisions related to or affecting creditors' right and remedies generally; (ii) general equitable principles, regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and principles limiting the availability of the remedy of specific performance; (iii) concepts of good faith, fair dealing, materiality and reasonableness; and (iv) the possible unenforceability under certain circumstances of provisions providing for indemnification or contribution that is contrary to public policy. In particular, as contemplated by these qualifications, in rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, we express no opinion as to federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers. Further, no opinion is given herein as to the enforceability of any particular provision of the Indenture or the Securities, relating to (i) waivers of rights to object to jurisdiction or venue, or consents to jurisdiction or venue, (ii) waivers of rights to (or methods of) service of process, or rights to trial by jury, or other rights or benefits bestowed by operation of law, (iii) waivers of any applicable defenses, setoffs, recoupments, or counterclaims, (iv) the grant of powers of attorney or proxies, (v) exculpation or exoneration clauses, indemnity clauses, and clauses relating to releases or waivers of unmatured claims or rights, (vi) submission to binding arbitration, or (vii) the imposition or collection or payment of any premium, liquidated damages, or other amount which may be held by any court to be a "penalty" or a "forfeiture."
Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
1. the Indenture is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantors enforceable against the Issuer and the Guarantors in accordance with its terms; and
2. the Securities are validly issued and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Issuer and the Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of New York, and the federal law of the United States, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other laws.
