No labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any or its subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent, and the Company is not aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or any subsidiary's principal suppliers, manufacturers, customers or contractors, which, in either case, may reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (v) Absence of Proceedings. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or 10
affecting the Company or any subsidiary, which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than as disclosed therein), or which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to affect the properties or assets thereof in a manner which would result in a Material Adverse Effect or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement or the Offered Securities; the aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or of which any of their respective property or assets is the subject which are not described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (w) Accuracy of Exhibits. There are no contracts or documents which are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein or to be filed as exhibits thereto which have not been so described and filed as required. (x) Possession of Licenses and Permits. The Company and its subsidiaries possess such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, "Governmental Licenses") issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them; the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except when the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result in a Material Adverse Effect. (y) Possession of Intellectual Property. The Company and its subsidiaries own or possess, or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names or other intellectual property (collectively, "Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on the business now operated by them, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to protect the interest of the Company or any of its subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy, singly or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect. 11
(z) Title to Property. The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and good title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind except such as (i) are described in the Prospectus or (ii) do not, singly or in the aggregate, materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and all of the leases and subleases material to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds properties described in the Prospectus, are in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any subsidiary has any notice of any material claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company or any subsidiary under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the rights of the Company or such subsidiary to the continued possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (aa) Investment Company Act. The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). (bb) Environmental Laws. Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and except as would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy or rule of common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof, including any judicial or administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of human health, the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, authorizations and approvals required under any applicable Environmental Laws and are each in compliance with their requirements, (iii) there are no pending or threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, demand letters, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (iv) there are no events or circumstances that might reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or any Environmental Laws. 12
(cc) Maintenance of Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act) that (A) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the filings made by the Company with the Commission which it may make under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act are being prepared, (B) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing of the Company's most recent annual report filed with the Commission and (C) are effective to perform the functions for which they were established. The accountants and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company have been advised of (x) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Company's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the accountants; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Any certificate signed by any director or officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company as to the matters covered thereby. SECTION 2. Purchase and Sale. (a) Initial Securities. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein and therein set forth. Offered Securities which are subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Delayed Delivery Offered Securities" and Offered Securities which are not subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Immediate Delivery Offered Securities". (b) Option Securities. In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company may grant, if so provided in the Terms Agreement, an option to the Underwriters named in the Terms Agreement, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to the number or principal amount of Option Securities set forth therein at the same price per security (plus, except as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement, interest, if any, accrued and unpaid from the Closing Time until the applicable Date of Delivery, and less, except as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement, an amount equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and paid or payable on the initial Offered 13
Securities but not payable on the Option Securities), as is applicable to the Offered Securities. Such option, if granted, will expire 30 days after the date of the Terms Agreement, and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time only for the purpose of covering over-allotments which may be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Offered Securities upon notice by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the number or principal amount of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities. Any such time and date of delivery (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than seven full business days and not earlier than two full business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Time, as hereinafter defined, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company. If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Securities, each of the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, will purchase the proportion of the total number or principal amount of Option Securities then being purchased that the number or principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities each such Underwriter has agreed to purchase, as set forth in the Terms Agreement, bears to the total principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives in their discretion shall make to eliminate any sales or purchases in less than authorized denominations or of a fractional number of shares, as the case may be. (c) Payment, Denominations and Registration. Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the place set forth in the Terms Agreement, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on the third business day (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10) following the date of the Terms Agreement or such other time as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company (such time and date being referred to as the "Closing Time"). Except as specified in the Terms Agreement, payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer in same day funds to the account of the Company specified in the Terms Agreement against delivery to the Underwriters for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by them (unless the Offered Securities are issuable only in the form of one or more global securities registered in the name of a depository or a nominee of a depository, in which event the Underwriters' interest in such global securities shall be noted in a manner satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel). In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Securities are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates representing, such Option Securities shall be made at such place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on each Date of Delivery as agreed by the Representatives and the Company. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request in writing at least two business days prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, which if agreed by the Representatives may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by the Representatives on or before the first business day prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. 14
(d) Delayed Delivery Contracts. (i) If authorized by the Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, with such changes therein as the Company may approve. As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to the Representatives at the Closing Time, for the account of the Underwriters, a fee equal to that percentage of the aggregate number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at the Closing Time as is specified in the Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. At the Closing Time the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate number or principal amount of Offered Securities in excess of that specified in the Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. (ii) The Representatives are to submit to the Company, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract. (iii) The number or principal amount of Offered Securities agreed to be purchased by the respective Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by the Underwriters to the Company; provided, however, that the total number or principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the total amount of the Offered Securities covered by this Agreement, less the total number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts. SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows: (a) Preparation of Prospectus Supplement. Immediately following the execution of the Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement 15
in form approved by the Representatives setting forth the principal amount of Offered Securities and their terms not otherwise specified in the Indenture, if applicable, the names of the Underwriters and the number or principal amount of the Offered Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters, the price at which the Offered Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, the selling concession and reallowance, if any, any delayed delivery arrangements, and such other information as the Representatives and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives shall reasonably request. (b) Continued Compliance With Securities Laws. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly amend the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or the 1933 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply with such requirements. (c) Rule 158. The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering each twelve month period beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Offered Securities. (d) Filing of Additional Registration Statements or Amendments. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Debt Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b)) or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise; will furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or use, as the case may be; and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters reasonably object. 16
(e) Compliance with Commission Requests and Notification of Ratings Changes. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will notify the Representatives immediately, and promptly confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (v) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and (vi) any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. (f) Delivery of Registration Statements and Prospectuses. The Company will deliver to each Underwriter one conformed copy of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) and will also deliver to the Representatives as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) as the Representatives may reasonably request. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives reasonably request. (g) Blue Sky Qualifications. The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 17
(h) Compliance with 1934 Act. The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act within the time periods prescribed by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (i) Restriction on Offers and Sales of Securities. If specified in the Terms Agreement, between the date of the Terms Agreement and 90 days after the completion of the distribution of the Offered Securities or the Closing Time, whichever is later, or such other time as is specified in the Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any securities of the Company substantially similar to the Offered Securities (other than the Offered Securities that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement or commercial paper in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise specified in the Terms Agreement). (j) Reservation of Securities. If the applicable Terms Agreement specifies that any related Underlying Securities include Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or Depositary Shares, the Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive or other similar rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue such Underlying Securities upon exercise of the related Warrants, as applicable, or upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, Senior Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as applicable. (k) Listing. The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities, prior to the Closing Time, on any national securities exchange or quotation system if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. SECTION 4. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements which the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of all of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and under the Terms Agreement, and to the following further conditions: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement. The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, has become effective under the 1933 Act and, at the Closing Time, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of counsel to the Underwriters. 18
(b) Opinions of Counsel. At the Closing Time, the Underwriters shall have received: (i) Opinion of Counsel for Company. The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Holland & Knight LLP ("H&K"), counsel to the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect as set forth below and to such further effect as counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request: (1) The Company is a corporation incorporated and validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. (2) The Company has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any. (3) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. (4) If applicable, the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Capitalization" (except for subsequent issuances, if any, pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee benefit plans referred to in the Prospectus or pursuant to the exercise of convertible securities or options referred to in the Prospectus); the shares of issued and outstanding capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; to such counsel's knowledge, none of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company was issued in violation of the preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. (5) This Agreement and the applicable Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (6) If the Offered Securities include Common Stock, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. Such Offered Securities, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration therefor specified in this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. No holder of such Offered Securities is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. The form of certificate used to evidence the Offered Securities is in due and proper form and complies 19
with all applicable statutory requirements, with any applicable requirements of the Company's charter and by-laws and with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. (7) If the Offered Securities include Preferred Stock and/or Depositary Shares, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. The applicable Preferred Stock, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration therefor, or for the related Depositary Shares, as the case may be, specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. In addition, upon deposit by the Company of any Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares with the applicable Depositary and the execution and delivery by such Depositary of the Depositary Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares, in each case pursuant to the applicable Deposit Agreement, such Depositary Shares will represent legal and valid interests in such Preferred Stock. No holder of such Preferred Stock or Depositary Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. The applicable Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights will be in full force and effect prior to the Closing Time. The form of certificate used to evidence the Preferred Stock is in due and proper form and complies with all applicable statutory requirements, with any applicable requirements of the Company's charter and by-laws and with the requirements of the exchange or system, if any, on which the Offered Securities are listed or admitted for trading, as the case may be. (8) If the Offered Securities include Depositary Shares or if Debt Securities are convertible into Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock, the applicable Deposit Agreement has been, or prior to the issuance of such Depositary Stock will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the applicable Depositary of the applicable Deposit Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Each registered holder of a Depositary Receipt under the applicable Deposit Agreement will be entitled to the proportional rights, preferences and limitations of the Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Depositary Receipt and to such other rights as are granted to such registered holder in such Deposit Agreement. 20
(9) If the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, or if Preferred Stock is, or Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock are convertible into Debt Securities, each applicable Indenture has been, or prior to the issuance of the Debt Securities thereunder will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming each applicable Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the applicable Trustee) constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Offered Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. (10) If the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, such Offered Securities, have been or as at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized for issuance, offer and sale pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contract and the Indenture against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Offered Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and each holder of Offered Securities will be entitled to the benefits of such Indenture. (11) If the Offered Securities include Warrants, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. Such Offered Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for the applicable Warrant Agreement and delivered against payment of the consideration therefor specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits provided by such Warrant Agreement and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating 21
to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (12) If the Offered Securities include Warrants, each applicable Warrant Agreement has been, or prior to the issuance of such Offered Securities will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the applicable Warrant Agent of the applicable Warrant Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (13) If the Underlying Securities related to the Offered Securities include Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, such Underlying Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company upon exercise of the Common Stock Warrants or Preferred Stock Warrants, as applicable, or upon conversion of the related Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, Senior Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as applicable. If the Underlying Securities include Common Stock or Preferred Stock, such Underlying Securities, when issued upon such exercise or conversion, as applicable, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. If the Underlying Securities include Depositary Shares, such Underlying Securities, upon deposit by the Company of the Preferred Stock represented thereby with the applicable Depositary and the execution and delivery by such Depositary of the Depositary Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares, in each case pursuant to the applicable Deposit Agreement, will represent legal and valid interests in such Preferred Stock. No holder of such Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Depositary Receipts evidencing Depository Shares is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. If the Underlying Securities related to the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, such Underlying Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized for issuance by the Company upon the exercise of the Debt Security Warrants or upon conversion of the related Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable. Such Underlying Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for in the applicable Indenture and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Debt Security Warrants or the related Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, 22
except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by requirements that a claim with respect to any Debt Securities payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. (14) The Offered Securities and each applicable Indenture, Deposit Agreement and Warrant Agreement, as of each Representation Date, and any Underlying Securities, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the related Offered Securities, will conform in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus and will be in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; and the statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities", insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions. (15) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, has been declared effective under the 1933 Act; any required filing of the Prospectuses pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission. (16) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or any information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b) or Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, as applicable, the Prospectuses, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom and other than those parts of the Registration Statement that constitute the Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (17) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectuses (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they 23
were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (18) To such counsel's knowledge and except as described in the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party, or to which the property of the Company or any subsidiary is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if applicable, or any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement, or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. (19) The information in, or incorporated by reference into, the Prospectus under the captions entitled "Facilities", "Legal Proceedings", "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" or any similar caption or captions, if applicable, and in the Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters, the Company's charter and bylaws or legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by such counsel and is correct in all material respects; and, if applicable, the opinion of the firm set forth under "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" or any similar caption, if applicable, is confirmed. (20) All descriptions in the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its subsidiaries are a party are accurate in all material respects; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects. (21) To such counsel's knowledge, no filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations, which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if applicable, or any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities. (22) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts and each applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement 24
and Deposit Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and in the Registration Statement (including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities, and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use Of Proceeds" and the issuance of any Underlying Securities) and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and under any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the Indenture do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event under or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to such counsel, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any subsidiary, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or operations. (23) The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act. (24) If the Offered Securities include Debt Securities, the applicable Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). (ii) Opinion of Local Counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman L.P. ("Jabil Circuit Cayman"). The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of local counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect as set forth below and to such further effect as counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request: 25
(1) Jabil Circuit Cayman is duly established as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands. (2) The Company, as general partner of Jabil Circuit Cayman, has corporate power and authority under Cayman Islands law to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct the business of Jabil Circuit Cayman. (3) Except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, all of the issued and outstanding partnership interests of Jabil Circuit Cayman have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and, to such counsel's knowledge, are owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. (4) None of the outstanding partnership interests of Jabil Circuit Cayman were issued in violation of the preemptive or similar rights of any of its partnership interest holders. (5) To such counsel's knowledge, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, to which Jabil Circuit Cayman is a party, or to which the property of Jabil Circuit Cayman is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). (iii) Opinion of Counsel for Underwriters. The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (5), (6) through (9), (10) through (14), (15), (16) and (24) (in each case, as applicable), of subsection (b)(i) of this Section. (iv) In giving their opinions required by subsection (b)(i) and (b)(iii), respectively, of this Section 4, Holland & Knight LLP and Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP shall each additionally state that in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus such counsel has considered the 26
information set forth therein in light of the matters required to be set forth therein, and has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, including its independent public accountants, during the course of which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Such counsel need not independently check the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise verify, and accordingly need not pass upon, and accordingly need not assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except as set forth in items (14), (19), (20) and (24) of the opinion set forth in subsection (b)(i)). Such counsel shall additionally state that, however, as a result of such consideration and participation, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (or, if an amendment to the Registration Statement or an Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, then at the time such amendment became effective or at the time of the most recent such filing, as the case may be), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the Prospectus was issued at the time any such amendment or supplement was issued, or at the Closing Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief with respect to the financial statements and other financial data contained in the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus) or those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Form T-1). (c) Officer's Certificate. At the Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the chief financial or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 are true and correct as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Company has performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the date of such certificate and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the Commission. As used in this Section 4(c), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the Offered Securities. 27
(d) Accountants' Comfort Letters. (i) On the date of the Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received a letter from KPMG LLP (and each other independent accountants with respect to financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), dated as of the date thereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

(e) Approval of Listing. At Closing Time, the Offered Securities shall have been approved for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance, on the securities exchanges, if any, specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. (f) No Objection. If the Registration Statement or an offering of Offered Securities has been filed with the NASD for review, the NASD shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements. (g) Lock-up Agreements. On the date of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received, in form and substance satisfactory to them, each lock-up agreement, if any, specified in such Terms Agreement as being required to be delivered by the persons listed therein. (h) Additional Documents. At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein and in the Terms Agreement contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives. (i) Conditions to Purchase of Option Securities. In the event that the Terms Agreement provides for Option Securities and the Underwriters exercise their option pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any portion of the Option Securities, the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and the statements in 28
any certificates furnished by the Company hereunder shall be true and correct as of each Date of Delivery, and the Underwriters shall have received: (i) Unless the Date of Delivery is the Closing Time, a certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of the Chief Executive Officer, President or a Vice President and the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer, the principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company, in their capacities as such, confirming that the certificate delivered at the Closing Time pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof remains true and correct as of such Date of Delivery. (ii) The favorable opinion of Holland & Knight LLP, counsel for the Company and local counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and otherwise substantially to the same effect as the opinions required by subsections (i) and (ii) of Section 4(b) hereof. (iii) The favorable opinion of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and otherwise to the same effect as the opinion required by subsection (iii) to Section 4(b) hereof. (iv) Unless the Date of Delivery is the Closing Time, a letter from KPMG LLP (and each other applicable independent accountants), in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and dated such Date of Delivery, substantially the same in scope and substance as the letter furnished to the Underwriters at the Closing Time pursuant to Section 4(d) hereof, except that the "specified date" in the letter shall be a date not more than three days prior to such Date of Delivery. If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 5. SECTION 5. Payment of Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (a) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, and all amendments thereto and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (b) the preparation, filing and reproduction of this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contract(s), if applicable; (c) the preparation, printing, issuance and delivery of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities, including any fees and expenses relating to the eligibility and issuance of Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities in book-entry form; 29

If this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters in accordance with the provisions of Section 9, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters. SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: 30
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, including information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b) or Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and expenses of counsel chosen by such Underwriter), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above. provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter with respect to any preliminary prospectus to the extent that the Company shall sustain the burden of proving that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Underwriter, in contravention of a requirement of applicable law, sold Offered Securities to a person to whom such Underwriter failed to send or give, at or prior to the Closing Time, a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) if (i) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof (sufficiently in advance of the Closing Time and in sufficient quantity to allow for distribution by the Closing Time) to the Underwriters and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Underwriter resulted from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from the preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) prior to 31
the Closing Time and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person and (ii) such failure to give or send such Prospectus by the Closing Time to the party or parties asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have constituted the sole defense to the claim asserted by such person. (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for the fees and expenses of counsel which the 32
indemnifying party is required to pay pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) and Section 6(b) hereof, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party as required hereunder in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. (e) For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof, including, without limitation, any copies filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total commission or underwriting discount received by each Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation 33
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Securities sold to or through each Underwriter and not joint. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person of an Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any Offered Securities. SECTION 9. Termination. (a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to 34
market the Offered Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Offered Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or in Europe, or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign currency or currencies in which the Offered Securities are denominated or payable, or (iv) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of the Terms Agreement shall have been lowered since that date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (v) there shall have come to the attention of the Representatives any facts that would cause them to reasonably believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Offered Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section 9, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the related Offered Securities. (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except to the extent provided in Section 5.

SECTION 10. Default. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or a Date of Delivery to purchase the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms 35
herein set forth. If, however, during such 24 hours the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Securities, then: (a) if the amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement or, with respect to any Date of Delivery which occurs after the Closing Time, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Option Securities to be purchased and sold on such Date of Delivery shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement or, in the case of a Date of Delivery which is after the Closing Time, which does not result in a termination of the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities, as the case may be, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10. SECTION 11. Notices.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company and any agent of the Trustee or the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act shall be valid or effective if made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date. (2) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing referred to in this Section 1.4 may be proved in any reasonable manner; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (a) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (b) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, (c) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (d) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by the Person so executing such instrument or writing and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Company and the Trustee deem sufficient. 15
(5) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of any Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may at its option (but is not obligated to), by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Securities entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of Registered Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders of Registered Securities shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. (6) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such Act is made upon such Security. Section 1.5. Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder or the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or (2) the Company by the Trustee or any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to the attention of its Treasurer at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company. Section 1.6. Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, (1) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Registered Securities if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Registered Security affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice; and 16
(2) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Bearer Securities, if any, if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and, if such Securities are then listed on any stock exchange outside the United States, in an Authorized Newspaper in such city as the Company shall advise the Trustee that such stock exchange so requires, on a Business Day at least twice, the first such publication to be not earlier than the earliest date and the second such publication not later than the latest date prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Registered Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given or provided. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification shall be made by overnight courier. In case by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice mailed to Holders of Registered Securities as provided above. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. Section 1.7. Language of Notices. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that, if the Company so elects, any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.

Securities not denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in such denominations as are established with respect to such Securities in or pursuant to this Indenture. Section 3.3. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its President, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. Coupons shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer or one of the Vice Presidents of the Company. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities or any Coupons appertaining thereto may be manual or facsimile. Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons or did not hold such offices at the date of original issuance of such Securities or Coupons. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company, to the Trustee for authentication and, provided that the Board Resolution and Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture or indentures with respect to such Securities referred to in Section 3.1 and a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities have been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order and subject to the provisions hereof and of such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, or make available for delivery, such Securities. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities and any Coupons 25
appertaining thereto, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Sections 315(a) through 315(d) of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, (1) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that: (a) the form or forms and terms of such Securities and Coupons, if any, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (b) all conditions precedent to the authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, have been complied with and that such Securities and Coupons, when completed by appropriate insertions and attested by duly authorized officers of the Company, delivered by duly authorized officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication pursuant to this Indenture, and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and will entitle the Holders thereof to the benefits of this Indenture; such Opinion of Counsel need express no opinion as to the availability of equitable remedies; (c) all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities and Coupons, if any, have been complied with; (d) this Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and (e) the Indenture and or Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and (assuming this Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee) constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgement in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and (2) an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution, authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, have been complied with and that, to the best knowledge of the Persons executing such certificate, no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time would become, an Event of Default with respect to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing. 26
If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such opinion and certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series. After any such first delivery, any separate written request by an Authorized Officer of the Company that the Trustee authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue will be deemed to be a certification by the Company that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to authentication and delivery of such Securities continue to have been complied with. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate or to cause an Authenticating Agent to authenticate any Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken. Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security and any Bearer Security in global form shall be dated as of the date specified in or pursuant to this Indenture. No Security or Coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for in Section 2.2 or 6.11 executed by or on behalf of the Trustee or by the Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. Such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Except as permitted by Section 3.6 or 3.7, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons appertaining thereto then matured have been detached and cancelled. Section 3.4. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and deliver to the Trustee and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner provided in Section 3.3, temporary Securities in lieu thereof which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Such temporary Securities may be in global form. Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of the same series and containing terms and provisions that are identical to those of any temporary Securities, such temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at an Office or Agency for such Securities, without charge to any Holder thereof. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or 27
more temporary Securities (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and containing identical terms and provisions; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security, except as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in or pursuant to this Indenture. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to a temporary global Security, until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series. Section 3.5. Registration, Transfer and Exchange. With respect to the Registered Securities of each series, if any, the Company shall cause to be kept a register (each such register being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") at an Office or Agency for such series in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Registered Securities of such series and of transfers of the Registered Securities of such series. Such Office or Agency shall be the "Security Registrar" for that series of Securities. Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities, the Trustee shall be the initial Security Registrar for each series of Securities. The Company shall have the right to remove and replace from time to time the Security Registrar for any series of Securities; provided that no such removal or replacement shall be effective until a successor Security Registrar with respect to such series of Securities shall have been appointed by the Company and shall have accepted such appointment by the Company. In the event that the Trustee shall not be or shall cease to be Security Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register for such series at all reasonable times. There shall be only one Security Register for each series of Securities. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any Office or Agency for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions. At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered 28
Securities of such series containing identical terms, denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture and in the same aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such series located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such Office or Agency for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series and like tenor after the close of business at such Office or Agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Bearer Securities upon such terms and conditions as may be provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to such series. Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange as contemplated by the immediately preceding two paragraphs, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any global Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities only if (i) the Depository is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that such global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. If the beneficial owners of interests in a global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities as the result of 29
an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in such form and denominations as are required by or pursuant to this Indenture, and of the same series, containing identical terms and in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such global Security shall be surrendered from time to time by the U.S. Depository or such other Depository as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, and in accordance with instructions given to the Trustee and the U.S. Depository or such other Depository, as the case may be (which instructions shall be in writing but need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate or be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive Securities as described above without charge. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for each portion of such surrendered global Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such global Security to be exchanged, which (unless such Securities are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof, but subject to the satisfaction of any certification or other requirements to the issuance of Bearer Securities; provided, however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of the same series to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and provided, further, that (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such global Security shall be returned by the Trustee to such Depository or the U.S. Depository, as the case may be, or such other Depository or U.S. Depository referred to above in accordance with the instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a global Security after the close of business at the Office or Agency for such Security where such exchange occurs on or after (i) any Regular Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related proposed date for payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such global Security shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and entitling the Holders thereof to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 30
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such Security duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of any notice of redemption of Securities of like tenor and the same series under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such selection, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except, to the extent provided with respect to such Bearer Security, that such Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of like tenor and the same series, provided that such Registered Security shall be immediately surrendered for redemption with written instruction for payment consistent with the provisions of this Indenture or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which, in accordance with its terms, has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid. Section 3.6. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.6, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security. If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains with all appurtenant Coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen, a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains. 31
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6, in case any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or Coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, be payable only at an Office or Agency for such Securities located outside the United States and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on Bearer Securities and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 3.6, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security, with any Coupons appertaining thereto issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains shall constitute a separate obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and Coupons appertaining thereto or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series and any Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section 3.6, as amended or supplemented pursuant to this Indenture with respect to particular Securities or generally, shall be exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons. Section 3.7. Payment of Interest and Certain Additional Amounts; Rights to Interest and Certain Additional Amounts Preserved. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, and are punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, but shall not be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Registered Security (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be 32
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed by the Company in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on such Registered Security, the Special Record Date therefor and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Person entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. The Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after notification to the Trustee of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall in the name and at the expense of the Company cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holder of such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee shall, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of any particular series pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, at the option of the Company, interest on Registered Securities that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in the United States. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. In the case of any Registered Security of any series that is convertible into shares of Common Stock or exchangeable for other securities, which Registered Security is converted or exchanged after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Registered Security with respect to which the Stated Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such 33
conversion or exchange, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Registered Security (or one or more predecessor Registered Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Registered Security which is converted or exchanged, interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion or exchange of such Registered Security shall not be payable. Section 3.8. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered in the Security Register as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, any premium and (subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.7) interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Registered Security shall be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security or the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or Coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Security or Coupon shall be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. No Holder of any beneficial interest in any global Security held on its behalf by a Depository shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such global Security, and such Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Section 3.9. Cancellation. All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer, exchange or conversion or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and Coupons, as well as Securities and Coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose, shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or pursuant to this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and Coupons held by the 34
Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its customary manner, unless by a Company Order the Company directs their return to it. Section 3.10. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or in any Security, interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Section 3.11. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing Securities may obtain CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use) or other identifying numbers, and, if so obtained, the Trustee shall use such numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or other identifying numbers. ARTICLE 4 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE Section 4.1. Satisfaction and Discharge. Upon the direction of the Company by a Company Order, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Order and any Coupons appertaining thereto, and the Trustee, on receipt of a Company Order, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series, when (1) either (a) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered and all Coupons appertaining thereto (other than (i) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such series surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities of such series and maturing after such exchange whose surrender is not required or has been waived as provided in Section 3.5, (ii) Securities and Coupons of such series which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6, (iii) Coupons appertaining to Securities of such series called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date whose surrender has been waived as provided in Section 11.6, and (iv) Securities and Coupons of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Securities of such series and, in the case of (i) or (ii) below, any Coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation 35
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Company, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose, money in the Currency in which such Securities are payable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Maturity thereof, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with. In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of such series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any series of Securities, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.6 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series under Sections 3.5, 3.6, 4.3, 10.2 and 10.3, with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 10.4 (but only to the extent that the Additional Amounts payable with respect to such Securities exceed the amount deposited in respect of such Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 4.1(1)(b)), and with respect to any rights to convert or exchange such Securities into Common Stock or other securities shall survive. Section 4.2. Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. (1) Unless pursuant to Section 3.1, either or both of (i) defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under clause (2) of this Section 4.2 shall not be applicable with respect to the Securities of such series or (ii) covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under clause (3) of this Section 4.2 shall not be applicable with respect to the Securities of such series, then such provisions, together with the other provisions of this Section 4.2 (with 36
such modifications thereto as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to any Securities), shall be applicable to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have Section 4.2(2) or Section 4.2(3) be applied to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Section 4.2. (2) Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section 4.2(2) with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of clause (5) of this Section 4.2 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 and as more fully set forth in such clause, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on, and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto when such payments are due, and any rights of such Holder to convert such Securities into Common Stock or exchange such Securities for other securities, (ii) the obligations of the Company and the Trustee with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.5, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3 and with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by Section 10.4 (but only to the extent that the Additional Amounts payable with respect to such Securities exceed the amount deposited in respect of such Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) below), and with respect to any rights to convert such Securities into Common Stock or exchange such Securities for other securities, (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (iv) this Section 4.2. The Company may exercise its option under this Section 4.2(2) notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under clause (3) of this Section 4.2 with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. (3) Upon the Company's exercise of the option to have this Section 4.2(3) apply with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, and, to the extent specified pursuant to Section 3.1(19), any other covenant applicable to such Securities, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with any such covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant 37
defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with, and shall have no liability in respect of, any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 5.1(4) or 5.1(9) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby. (4) The following shall be the conditions to application of clause (2) or (3) of this Section 4.2 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto: (a) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 6.7 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.2 applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, (1) an amount in Dollars or in such Foreign Currency in which such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are then specified as payable at Stated Maturity, or (2) Government Obligations applicable to such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto (determined on the basis of the Currency in which such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto are then specified as payable at Stated Maturity) which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, money in an amount, or (3) a combination thereof, in any case, in an amount, sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal and interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, (y) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto at the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or premium or interest and (z) any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on the days on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. (b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and, with respect to defeasance only, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date 38
of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period). (d) In the case of an election under clause (2) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a letter ruling, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service a Revenue Ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. (e) In the case of an election under clause (3) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred. (f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, after the 123rd day after the date of deposit, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) pursuant to this clause (4) to be held in trust will not be subject to any case or proceeding (whether voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Company under any Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or any decree or order for relief in respect of the Company issued in connection therewith. (g) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance or covenant defeasance under clause (2) or (3) of this Section 4.2 (as the case may be) have been complied with. (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 4.2(4), such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.1. (5) Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or any Security, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made, (a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 3.1 or the terms of such Security to receive payment in a Currency other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made in respect of such Security, or (b) a Conversion Event occurs in respect of the Foreign Currency in which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such Security and any Coupons 39
appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any), and interest, if any, on, and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, such Security as the same becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below in the case of any such election) the amount or other property deposited in respect of such Security into the Currency in which such Security becomes payable as a result of such election or Conversion Event based on (x) in the case of payments made pursuant to clause (a) above, the applicable market exchange rate for such Currency in effect on the second Business Day prior to each payment date, or (y) with respect to a Conversion Event, the applicable market exchange rate for such Foreign Currency in effect (as nearly as feasible) at the time of the Conversion Event. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 4.2(5) and Section 4.3, the "Trustee") against any tax, fee or other charge, imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to this Section 4.2 or the principal or interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. Anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 4.2. Section 4.3. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities, and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any; but such money and Government Obligations need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 40

(6) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall fail within 30 days to pay, bond or otherwise discharge uninsured judgments or court orders for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate, which are not stayed on appeal or are not otherwise being appropriately contested in good faith; or (7) the entry by a court having competent jurisdiction of: (a) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an involuntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (b) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (c) a final and non-appealable order appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee or other similar official of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or of any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (8) the commencement by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of a voluntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of a voluntary proceeding seeking to be adjudicated insolvent or the consent by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the entry of a decree or order for relief in an involuntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or relief under any applicable law, or the consent by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee or similar official of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the making by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the taking of corporate action by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in furtherance of any such action; or (9) any other Event of Default provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series. Section 5.2. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 5.1) occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal of all the 42
Securities of such series, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal or such lesser amount shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 5.1 occurs, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of the Outstanding Securities of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series) shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of any Security of that series. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum of money sufficient to pay (a) all overdue installments of any interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to all Securities of such series and any Coupon appertaining thereto, (b) the principal of and any premium on any Securities of such series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon and any Additional Amounts with respect thereto at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, (c) to the extent that payment of such interest or Additional Amounts is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of any interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and (d) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.6; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.3. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if 43
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto when such interest or Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security or any Additional Amounts with respect thereto at their Maturity, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the whole amount of money then due and payable with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, with interest upon the overdue principal, any premium and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount of money as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6. If the Company fails to pay the money it is required to pay the Trustee pursuant to the preceding paragraph forthwith upon the demand of the Trustee, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the money so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and collect the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or such Securities or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 5.4. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series or the property of the Company or such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any overdue principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, 44
(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of any applicable series, of the principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents or counsel) and of the Holders of Securities or any Coupons appertaining thereto allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (2) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities or any Coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities or any Coupons, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.6. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or Coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon in any such proceeding. Section 5.5. Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities or Coupons. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the Securities or Coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery or judgment, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, shall be for the ratable benefit of each and every Holder of the Securities or Coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. Section 5.6. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal, or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts, upon presentation of the Securities or Coupons, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.6; 45
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities and any Coupons for principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on such Securities and Coupons for principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts, respectively; and THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled thereto. Section 5.7. Limitations on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series or any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as is reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture or any Security to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holders or Holders of Securities of any other series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. Section 5.8. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and any Premium, Interest and Additional Amounts. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security or Coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, any premium and (subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.7) interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Security or payment of such Coupon, as the case may be, on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities therefor specified in such Security or Coupon (or, in the 46
case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of such Holder if provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, on the date such repayment is due) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. Section 5.9. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or a Coupon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and each such Holder shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and each such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. Section 5.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons in the last paragraph of Section 3.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to each and every Holder of a Security or a Coupon is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy, to the extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not, to the extent permitted by law, prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Section 5.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or Coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to any Holder of a Security or a Coupon may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by such Holder, as the case may be. Section 5.12. Control by Holders of Securities. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or with the Securities of such series, (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and 47
(3) such direction is not unduly prejudicial to the rights of the other Holders of Securities of such series not joining in such action. Section 5.13. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on, or any Additional Amounts with respect to, any Security of such series or any Coupons appertaining thereto, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 9 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.14. Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants that (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company expressly waives (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. Section 5.15. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of any undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.15 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after 48
the Redemption Date, and, in the case of repayment, on or after the date for repayment) or for the enforcement of the right, if any, to convert or exchange any Security into Common Stock or other securities in accordance with its terms.

(4) If at any time: (a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the obligations imposed upon it under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to Securities of any series after written request therefor by the Company or any Holder of a Security of such series who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months, or (b) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.7 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or any such Holder, or (c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or the Securities of such series, or (ii) subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities of such series and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (5) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of such series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more 53
or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.9.

(1) Upon the appointment hereunder of any successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties hereunder of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or such successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of its charges, shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and, subject to Section 10.3, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section 6.6.

In case any Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered by the Trustee then 55
in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. Section 6.11. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents acceptable to the Company with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of that or those series issued upon original issue, exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption or partial repayment or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any Corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such Corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall (i) mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Registered Securities, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent shall serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, and (ii) if Securities of the series are issued as Bearer Securities, publish notice of such appointment at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the place where such successor Authenticating Agent has its principal office if such office is located outside the United States. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall 56
become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. The Company agrees to pay each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. The provisions of Sections 3.8, 6.3 and 6.4 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent. If an Authenticating Agent is appointed with respect to one or more series of Securities pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in substantially the following form: This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee By_______________________________, as Authenticating Agent By_______________________________, Authorized Officer If all of the Securities of any series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested in writing (which writing need not be accompanied by or contained in an Officers' Certificate by the Company), shall appoint in accordance with this Section an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Securities. Section 6.12. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon 57
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, determined as provided in Section 1.1, 1.4 and 5.12 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. 58

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which shall have been included expressly and solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders of Securities under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. Section 9.3. Execution of Supplemental Indentures. As a condition to executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trust created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent to the execution of such supplemental indenture have been fulfilled. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. 66
Section 9.4. Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of a Security theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder and of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall be bound thereby. Section 9.5. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures. Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. Section 9.6. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect. Section 9.7. Notice of Supplemental Indenture. Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 9.2, the Company shall transmit to the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series affected thereby a notice setting forth the substance of such supplemental indenture. ARTICLE 10 COVENANTS Section 10.1. Payment of Principal, any Premium, Interest and Additional Amounts. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of each series that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of, any premium and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series in accordance with the terms thereof, any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. Any interest due on any Bearer Security on or before the Maturity thereof, and any Additional Amounts payable with respect to such interest, shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto for such interest as they severally mature. Section 10.2. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an Office or Agency where Securities of such series (but not Bearer Securities, except as otherwise provided below, unless such Place of Payment is located outside the United States) may be 67
presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of such series that are convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series relating thereto and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the Company shall maintain, subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, an Office or Agency in a Place of Payment for such series which is located outside the United States where Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented and surrendered for payment; provided, however, that if the Securities of such series are listed on The Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company shall maintain a Paying Agent in London, Luxembourg or any other required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of such series are listed on such exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such Office or Agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Office or Agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented and surrendered for payment at the place specified for the purpose with respect to such Securities as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, no payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts with respect to Bearer Securities shall be made at any Office or Agency in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, if amounts owing with respect to any Bearer Securities shall be payable in Dollars, payment of principal of, any premium or interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any such Security may be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or any Office or Agency designated by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if (but only if) payment of the full amount of such principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts at all offices outside the United States maintained for such purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other Offices or Agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an Office or Agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other Office or Agency. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company hereby designates as the Place of Payment for each series of Securities the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and initially appoints the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as the Office or Agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for such purpose. The Company 68
may subsequently appoint a different Office or Agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for the Securities of any series. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 3.1, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a Foreign Currency or (ii) may be payable in a Foreign Currency, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, at least one exchange rate agent. Section 10.3. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of, any premium or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the Currency or currencies, Currency unit or units or composite Currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and shall promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it shall, on or prior to each due date of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities of such series, deposit with any Paying Agent a sum (in the Currency or currencies, Currency unit or units or composite Currency or currencies described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company shall cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall: (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of such series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture; (2) give the Trustee written notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series) in the making of any payment of principal, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series; and (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent. 69
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums. Except as otherwise provided herein or pursuant hereto, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of any series or any Coupon appertaining thereto and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or any such premium or interest or any such Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall, at the request and expense of the Company, cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment for such series or to be mailed to Holders of Registered Securities of such series, or both, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing nor shall it be later than two years after such principal and any premium or interest or Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. Section 10.4. Additional Amounts. If any Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company agrees to pay to the Holder of any such Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto Additional Amounts as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or such Securities. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or any Coupon or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided by the terms of such series established hereby or pursuant hereto to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms, and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provision hereof shall not be construed as excluding the payment of Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of the applicable series, if the Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to such series of Securities (or if the Securities of such series shall not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned 70
Officers' Certificate, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and the principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of and premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such series shall be made to Holders of Securities of such series or the Coupons appertaining thereto who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of such series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities or Coupons, and the Company agrees to pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants to fully indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section. Section 10.5. Limitations upon Liens. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee any Indebtedness secured by any Lien on any property (including shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness) or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, including, without limitation, Indebtedness under the Credit Facility, without in any such case effectively providing concurrently with the creation, incurrence, issuance, assumption or Guarantee of such Indebtedness or the grant of any Lien with respect to such Indebtedness that all Securities Outstanding at such time (together with, if the Company so determines, any other Indebtedness of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not subordinate to the Securities Outstanding at such time) will be secured by any such Lien equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured Indebtedness, so long as such secured Indebtedness is so secured. Provided, however, that in the case of the Credit Facility, such obligation will arise concurrently with the grant of any Lien thereunder, whether or not any Indebtedness shall be outstanding under the Credit Facility at such time. Except in the case of any Lien granted under the Credit Facility, the foregoing restrictions will not, however, apply to Indebtedness secured by: (i) Liens on property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary existing on the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities, (ii) Liens on property or assets of any Person existing prior to the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is, through one or a series of transactions, merged with or into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties of a Person as an entirety, through one or a series of transactions, or substantially as an entirety, through one or a series of transactions, to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or arising thereafter pursuant to contractual commitments entered into prior to and not in contemplation of such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and not in contemplation of any such merger or consolidation or any such sale, lease or other 71
disposition; provided that such Liens shall not extend to any other property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) Liens on property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary existing at the time of acquisition thereof (including acquisition through merger or consolidation); provided that such Liens were in existence prior to and were not created in contemplation of such acquisition and shall not extend to any other property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iv) Liens on property (including in the case of a plant or facility, the land on which it is erected and fixtures comprising a part thereof) or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary securing the payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or the cost of development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement of all or any part thereof, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed prior to, at the time of or within 180 days after, the acquisition of such property or assets or the completion of any such development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement, whichever is later, for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or such cost (provided, in the case of Liens securing the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed for the purposes of financing all or any part of such purchase price, such Liens are limited to the property or assets then being acquired and fixed improvements thereon and the Capital Stock of any person formed to acquire such property or assets, and, provided further, that in the case of Liens securing the payment of all or any part of the cost of development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement of any property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of such cost, such Liens are limited to the assets or property then being developed, constructed, altered, repaired or improved and the land on which such property is erected and fixtures comprising a part thereof), (v) Liens which secure Indebtedness owing by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary, (vi) Liens on the property of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United States of America or any State thereof, or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or any State thereof, or in favor of any other country, or any department, agency, or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof, in each case (a) securing partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute, (b) securing indebtedness incurred to finance all or any part of the purchase price or cost of constructing, installing or improving the property subject to such mortgages including mortgages to secure Indebtedness of the pollution control or industrial revenue bond type, or (c) securing indebtedness issued or Guaranteed by the United States of America, any State, any foreign country or any 72
department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of any such jurisdiction, (vii) statutory or common law landlords', carriers', warehouseman's, mechanics', suppliers', materialmens', repairmen's, or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business and with respect to amounts not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate legal proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and, in the latter case, for which a reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made, (viii) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith by appropriate legal proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and, in the latter case, for which adequate reserves or other appropriate provisions are being maintained, to the extent required by GAAP, (ix) zoning restrictions, easements or minor defects or irregularities in title and other similar charges or encumbrances on property not interfering in any material respect with the use of such property by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (x) customary deposit or reserve arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions, (xi) Liens that are within the general parameters customary in the industry and incurred in the ordinary course of business securing Indebtedness under any Interest Rate Agreement or Currency Agreement designed solely to protect the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from fluctuations in interest rates, currencies or the price of commodities, (xii) Liens incurred (a) in connection with workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and other types of statutory obligations or the requirements of any official body, including for the obtaining of licenses useful in the operation of business, or (b) to secure the performance of Surety Obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with industry practice or appeal bonds, or (c) to secure performance of leases, construction, sales or servicing contracts, supply or consignment contracts, and similar obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, in each case not incurred or made in connection with the borrowing of money, or (d) to secure obligations in respect of customs, duties, excise taxes, value-added taxes, rents, or goods or services (including utility services) provided to such person by governmental entities or suppliers, other similar items which under GAAP constitute operating expense, or (e) to obtain or secure obligations with respect to letters of credit, Guarantees, bonds or other sureties or assurances given in connection with the activities described in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, in each case not incurred or made in connection with 73
the borrowing of money, the obtaining of advances or credit or the payment of the deferred purchase price of property or services, (xiii) Liens on receivables incurred in connection with a Permitted Receivables Transaction; (xiv) judgment Liens against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not giving rise to an Event of Default, (xv) Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount outstanding from time to time of no more than $50,000,000 arising in connection with (a) "synthetic leases" or "tax retention operating leases" and (b) Capitalized Lease Obligations of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; (xvi) Liens arising in connection with the administration and operation of deposit accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operated and maintained outside of the United States of America in connection with cross-border, multiple currency cash pooling arrangements, including overdraft facilities; provided, however that such Liens shall not extent beyond the amounts on deposit therein; and (xvii) any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements), in whole or in part, of any of the Liens referred to in paragraphs (i) through (xvi) above or the Indebtedness secured thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may create, incur, issue or assume Indebtedness secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions if the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness secured by Liens on property or assets of the Company and of any Restricted Subsidiary then outstanding (not including any such Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted to be incurred pursuant to paragraphs (i) through (xvii) above) plus Attributable Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Sale and Leaseback Transactions that would otherwise be subject to the restrictions in Section 10.6 does not at the time such Indebtedness is incurred exceed an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; provided, however, that the foregoing exception does not apply to limit the right of Holders to be secured equally and ratably with the Lenders under the Credit Facility with regard to any collateral from time to time pledged pursuant to the Credit Facility. Holders not so secured will be secured equally and ratably by any Lien only to the extent that it is not otherwise permitted under paragraphs (i) through (xvii) above or to the extent the 10% limitation referred to above is exceeded. (b) For the purposes of clause (a) above, the giving of a Guarantee which is secured by a Lien and the creation of a Lien to secure Indebtedness which existed prior to the creation of such Lien, will be deemed to involve the creation of Indebtedness in an amount equal to the principal amount Guaranteed or secured by such Lien; but the amount of Indebtedness secured by Liens will be computed without cumulating the underlying Indebtedness with any Guarantee thereof or Lien securing the same. 74
(c) For the purposes of determining compliance with this Section 10.5, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in clause (a) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the items of clause (a) above may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above. Section 10.6. Limitations upon Sales and Leasebacks. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement after the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities with any bank, insurance company or other lender or investor (other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) providing for the leasing by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary of any property or assets for a period of more than three years (other than pursuant to so-called synthetic lease or tax retention operating lease transactions), which property or assets were or are owned or leased by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and which have been or are to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to such lender or investor or to any Person to whom funds have been or are to be advanced by such lender or investor on the security of such property or assets (herein referred to as a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless either: (i) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.5, to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such property or assets in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the applicable series of Securities; or (ii) the Company, within 180 days after the sale or transfer, applies or causes a Restricted Subsidiary to apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of such sale or transfer or the fair value of such property at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction (as determined by any two of the following: the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer and the Controller of the Company) to the retirement of Securities or other Funded Debts of the Company (other than Funded Debt subordinated to the Securities) or Funded Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that the amount to be so applied shall be reduced by (a) the principal amount of Securities delivered within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation, and (b) the principal amount of any such Funded Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, other than Securities, voluntarily retired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation, excluding in the case of both (a) and (b), retirement pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund payment or any mandatory prepayment provision or by payment at maturity. 75
Section 10.7. Restrictions on Funded Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee any Funded Debt. This restriction will not apply if: (i) The Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could create Indebtedness secured by Liens in accordance with one or more of clauses (i) through (xvii) of Section 10.5 (a) (whether or not such Indebtedness is in fact secured by Liens) or enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction in accordance with Section 10.6 in an amount equal to such Funded Debt, without equally and ratably securing the Securities, (ii) such Funded Debt existed on the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities, (iii) such Funded Debt is owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iv) such Funded Debt existed at the time the Person that issued such Funded Debt became a Restricted Subsidiary, or was, through one or a series of transactions, merged with or into or consolidated with such Restricted Subsidiary, or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition, through one or a series of transactions, of the properties of such Person as an entirety to such Restricted Subsidiary, or arising thereafter (a) otherwise than in connection with the borrowing of money arranged thereafter and (b) pursuant to contractual commitments entered into prior to and not in contemplation of such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and not in contemplation of any such merger or consolidation or any such sale, lease or other disposition, (v) such Funded Debt is Guaranteed by the Company, (vi) such Funded Debt is Guaranteed by a governmental agency, (vii) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or Guaranteed in connection with, or with a view to, compliance by such Restricted Subsidiary with the requirements of any program adopted by any federal, state or local governmental authority and applicable to such Restricted Subsidiary and providing financial or tax benefits to such Restricted Subsidiary which are not available directly to the Company, (viii) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or Guaranteed to pay all or any part of the purchase price or the construction cost of property or equipment acquired or constructed by a Restricted Subsidiary, provided such Funded Debt is incurred within 180 days after acquisition, completion of construction or commencement of full operation of such property, whichever is later, and, provided further, that 76
the principal amount of such Funded Debt does not exceed 100% of the fair market value of the property or equipment acquired or constructed, (ix) such Funded Debt is nonrecourse, or (x) such Funded Debt is incurred for the purpose of extending, renewing, substituting, replacing or refunding Funded Debt permitted by the foregoing clauses (i) through (ix). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Restricted Subsidiary may create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee Funded Debt which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions in an aggregate principal amount which, together with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all other Funded Debt of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including Funded Debt permitted to be incurred pursuant to clauses (i) through (x) above), does not at the time such Funded Debt is incurred exceed an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that any item of Funded Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Funded Debt and only be required to include the amount and type of such Funded Debt in one of the above clauses or the immediately preceding paragraph, and an item of Funded Debt may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above. Section 10.8. Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees by Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any of its Indebtedness ("Guaranteed Indebtedness"), unless (i) such Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture hereto providing for a Guarantee (a "Subsidiary Guarantee") of payment of the Securities of each series by such Subsidiary and (ii) such Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the company or any other Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee; provided that this paragraph shall not be applicable to any Guarantee of any Subsidiary that existed at the time such person became a Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such person becoming a Subsidiary. If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is (A) pari passu with the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be pari passu with, or subordinated to, the Subsidiary Guarantee or (B) subordinated to the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary may provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any person not an affiliate of the Company, of all of its and each other Subsidiary's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited hereby) or (ii) the release or discharge of the 77
Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee. Section 10.9. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article Eight, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries and the rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not obligate the Company to preserve the existence of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to any Holder. Section 10.10. Waiver of Certain Covenants. The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.5 through 10.9, inclusive, with respect to the Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by Act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. Section 10.11. Company Statement as to Compliance; Notice of Certain Defaults. (1) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a written statement (which need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate) signed by the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer of the Company, stating that (a) a review of the activities of the Company during such year and of its performance under this Indenture has been made under his or her supervision, and (b) to the best of his or her knowledge, based on such review, (a) the Company has complied with all the conditions and covenants imposed on it under this Indenture throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such condition or covenant, specifying each such default known to him or her and the nature and status thereof, and (b) no event has occurred and is continuing which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default, or, if such an event has occurred and is continuing, specifying each such event known to him and the nature and status thereof. (2) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within five days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Event of Default or any event which after notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) of Section 5.1. 78
Section 10.12. Calculation of Original Issue Discount. The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount of any Original Issue Discount Security (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. ARTICLE 11 REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES Section 11.1. Applicability of Article. Redemption of Securities of any series at the option of the Company as permitted or required by the terms of such Securities shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise provided herein or pursuant hereto) this Article. Section 11.2. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of (a) less than all of the Securities of any series; (b) all of the Securities of any series, with the same issue date, interest rate or formula, Stated Maturity and other terms or (c) any other instances, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. Section 11.3. Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed. If less than all of the Securities of any series with the same issue date, interest rate or formula, Stated Maturity and other terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee within five Business Days after it receives the notice provided for in Section 11.2 from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions of the principal amount of Registered Securities of such series; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Registered Security of such series not redeemed to less than the minimum denomination for a Security of such series established herein or pursuant hereto. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. 79
Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of any series, if any Security selected for partial redemption is converted into Common Stock or exchanged for other securities in part before termination of the conversion or exchange right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted or exchanged during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Section 11.4. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.6, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed, to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed. Failure to give notice by mailing in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Registered Securities designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities or portion thereof. Any notice that is mailed to the Holder of any Registered Securities in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not such Holder receives the notice. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amount) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed, (4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder of such Security will receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed, (5) that, on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price shall become due and payable upon each such Security or portion thereof to be redeemed, and, if applicable, that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date, (6) the place or places where such Securities, together (in the case of Bearer Securities) with all Coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and any accrued interest and Additional Amounts pertaining thereto, (7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, 80
(8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption or the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent is furnished, (9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and no Registered Securities of such series are to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on the Redemption Date pursuant to Section 3.5 or otherwise, the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be made, (10) in the case of Securities of any series that are convertible into Common Stock of the Company or exchangeable for other securities, the conversion or exchange price or rate, the date or dates on which the right to convert or exchange the principal of the Securities of such series to be redeemed will commence or terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, and (11) the CUSIP number or the Euroclear or the Clearstream reference numbers of such Securities, if any (or any other numbers used by a Depository to identify such Securities). A notice of redemption published as contemplated by Section 1.6 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. Section 11.5. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit, with respect to the Securities of any series called for redemption pursuant to Section 11.4, with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money in the applicable Currency sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 or in the Securities of such series) any accrued interest on and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, all such Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date. Section 11.6. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing 81
after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with any accrued interest and Additional Amounts to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Bearer Securities of such series, installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of Coupons for such interest (at an Office or Agency located outside the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2), and provided, further, that, except as otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Registered Securities of such series, installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the Regular Record Dates therefor according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7. If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that any interest or Additional Amounts represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such Security located outside of the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium, until paid, shall bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. Section 11.7. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at any Office or Agency for such Security (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, containing identical terms and provisions, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a Security in global form is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the U.S. Depository or other Depository for such Security in global form as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, without service charge, a new Security in global form in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security in global form so surrendered. 82
Section 11.8. Redemption for Tax Reasons. If (a) the Company shall have on any date (the "Succession Date") consolidated with or merged into, or conveyed or transferred or leased its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any Person which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (b) as result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of such jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or any change in the official administration, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Securities of any series, which change or amendment become effective after the Succession Date or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public on or prior to such Succession Date and is notified to the Company, such continuing Person would be required to pay any Successor Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of such Securities in respect of any payments that it may be required to make with respect to such Securities and (c) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company or such continuing Person taking reasonable measures available to it, the Company or such continuing Person may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) of such Securities, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice as provided in this Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued Interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which a continuing Person would be obligated to pay such Successor Additional Amounts were a payment then due in respect of such Securities, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Successor Additional Amounts must remain in effect. ARTICLE 12 SINKING FUNDS Section 12.1. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise permitted or required in or pursuant to this Indenture or any Security of such series issued pursuant to this Indenture. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of such series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series and this Indenture. 83
Section 12.2. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities. The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (1) deliver Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any of such Securities previously called for redemption or any of such Securities in respect of which cash shall have been released to the Company), together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto, and (2) apply as a credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such series of Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such series of Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. If, as a result of the delivery or credit of Securities of any series in lieu of cash payments pursuant to this Section 12.2, the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed in order to satisfy the remaining sinking fund payment shall be less than $100,000, the Trustee need not call Securities of such series for redemption, except upon Company Request, and such cash payment shall be held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent and applied to the next succeeding sinking fund payment, provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall at the request of the Company from time to time pay over and deliver to the Company any cash payment so being held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of Securities of that series purchased by the Company having an unpaid principal amount equal to the cash payment requested to be released to the Company. Section 12.3. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 75 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting of Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.2, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so credited and not theretofore delivered. If such Officers' Certificate shall specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not less than 60 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.6 and 11.7. 84
ARTICLE 13 REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF HOLDERS Section 13.1. Applicability of Article. Securities of any series which are repayable at the option of the Holders thereof before their Stated Maturity shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series. The repayment of any principal amount of Securities pursuant to such option of the Holder to require repayment of Securities before their Stated Maturity, for purposes of Section 3.9, shall not operate as a payment, redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the Company, at its option, shall deliver or surrender the same to the Trustee with a directive that such Securities be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.1, in connection with any repayment of Securities, the Company may arrange for the purchase of any Securities by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other purchasers to purchase such Securities by paying to the Holders of such Securities on or before the close of business on the repayment date an amount not less than the repayment price payable by the Company on repayment of such Securities, and the obligation of the Company to pay the repayment price of such Securities shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent such payment is so paid by such purchasers. ARTICLE 14 SECURITIES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES Section 14.1. Applicability of Article. Whenever this Indenture provides for (i) any action by, or the determination of any of the rights of, Holders of Securities of any series in which not all of such Securities are denominated in the same Currency, or (ii) any distribution to Holders of Securities, in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the form of Security of any particular series or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities, any amount in respect of any Security denominated in a Currency other than Dollars shall be treated for any such action or distribution as that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount on such reasonable basis of exchange and as of the record date with respect to Registered Securities of such series (if any) for such action, determination of rights or distribution (or, if there shall be no applicable record date, such other date reasonably proximate to the date of such action, determination of rights or distribution) as the Company may specify in a written notice to the Trustee. ARTICLE 15 MEETINGS OF HOLDERS OF SECURITIES Section 15.1. Purposes for Which Meetings May Be Called. A meeting of Holders of Securities of any series may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to this Article to make, give or take any request, demand, authorization, 85
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series. Section 15.2. Call, Notice and Place of Meetings. (1) The Trustee may at any time call a meeting of Holders of Securities of any series for any purpose specified in Section 15.1, to be held at such time and at such place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, if Securities of such series have been issued in whole or in part as Bearer Securities, in London or in such place outside the United States as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of every meeting of Holders of Securities of any series, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be given, in the manner provided in Section 1.6, not less than 21 nor more than 180 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting. (2) In case at any time the Company (by or pursuant to a Board Resolution) or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of the Holders of Securities of such series for any purpose specified in Section 15.1, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have mailed notice of or made the first publication of the notice of such meeting within 21 days after receipt of such request (whichever shall be required pursuant to Section 1.6) or shall not thereafter proceed to cause the meeting to be held as provided herein, then the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series in the amount above specified, as the case may be, may determine the time and the place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, if Securities of such series are to be issued as Bearer Securities, in London for such meeting and may call such meeting for such purposes by giving notice thereof as provided in clause (1) of this Section. Section 15.3. Persons Entitled to Vote at Meetings. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series, a Person shall be (1) a Holder of one or more Outstanding Securities of such series, or (2) a Person appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy for a Holder or Holders of one or more Outstanding Securities of such series by such Holder or Holders. The only Persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be the Persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel, any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel and any representatives of the Company and its counsel. Section 15.4. Quorum; Action. The Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a series shall constitute a quorum for any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series. In the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes after the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of Holders of Securities of such series, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may be adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any reconvened meeting, such reconvened meeting may be further adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the 86
adjournment of such reconvened meeting. Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section 15.2(1), except that such notice need be given only once not less than five days prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage, as provided above, of the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series which shall constitute a quorum. Except as limited by the proviso to Section 9.2, any resolution presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted only by the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; provided, however, that, except as limited by the proviso to Section 9.2, any resolution with respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act which this Indenture expressly provides may be made, given or taken by the Holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a series may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders of such specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series. Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all the Holders of Securities of such series and the Coupons appertaining thereto, whether or not such Holders were present or represented at the meeting. Section 15.5. Determination of Voting Rights; Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.4 and the appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.4 or by having the signature of the person executing the proxy witnessed or Guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 1.4 to certify to the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 1.4 or other proof. (2) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 15.2(2), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting. 87
(3) At any meeting, each Holder of a Security of such series or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security of such series or proxy. (4) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly called pursuant to Section 15.2 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting; and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice. Section 15.6. Counting Votes and Recording Action of Meetings. The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be by written ballots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities of such series or of their representatives by proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of the Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by them. The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in triplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, at least in triplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 15.2 and, if applicable, Section 15.4. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall be delivered to the Company, and another to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated. 88

The Company or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent. The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Paying Agent in connection with the Notes. Section 202 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities.

In either case, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order (which the Company agrees to deliver promptly), authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities in exchange therefor. Certificated Securities issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities shall be registered in such names and shall be in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered such Certificated Securities to the persons in whose names such Certificated Securities are so registered. Such exchange shall be effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. Nothing herein shall require the Trustee to communicate directly with beneficial owners, and the Trustee shall in connection with any transfers hereunder be entitled to rely on instructions received through the registered Holder. 4
In the event that Certificated Securities are issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and, thereafter, the events or conditions specified in this Section 202(a)(1) which required such exchange shall have ceased to exist, the Company shall mail notice to the Trustee and to the Holders stating that Holders may exchange Certificated Securities for interests in Global Securities by complying with the procedures set forth in this Indenture and briefly describing such procedures and the events or circumstances requiring that such notice be given. (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this First Supplemental Indenture other than the provisions set forth in Section 202(a)(1) hereof, a Global Security may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository. Nothing in this Section 202(a)(2) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 202. (b) Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities. When Certificated Securities are presented by a Holder to a Security Registrar with a request: (1) to register the transfer of the Certificated Securities to a person who will take delivery thereof in the form of Certificated Securities only; or (2) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount of Certificated Securities of other authorized denominations, such Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities presented or surrendered for register of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in accordance with the tenth paragraph of Section 3.5 of the Indenture. (c) Transfers to the Company. Nothing in this First Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall prohibit the sale or other transfer of any Notes (including beneficial interests in Global Securities) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which Notes shall thereupon be canceled in accordance with Section 3.9 of the Indenture. Section 203 Amount. (a) The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Notes for original issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300,000,000 upon one or more Company Orders for the authentication and delivery of Notes, without any further action by the Company.

Notes ("Additional Notes") in the future on the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the right to receive accrued and unpaid interest), except for differences in the issue price and Issue Date of the Additional Notes, and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes then Outstanding. No Additional Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes. Any Additional Notes would rank equally and ratably with the Notes then Outstanding and shall be treated as a single series for all purposes hereunder and under the Indenture. From and after the Issue Date of any Additional Notes, any reference herein to "Notes" shall include such Additional Notes. (b) The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 204 Interest. The principal of the Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum from July 21, 2003 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing January 15, 2004, to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (each, a "Regular Record Date").
