We're looking forward to expanding and improving our business throughout fiscal 2004." said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Company provided guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2004 indicating that it currently foresees revenue increasing sequentially six to ten percent, or in a range of $1.375 to $1.425 billion. Jabil said it currently foresees core operating income increasing sequentially seven to twelve percent and core earnings of $0.22 to $0.24 per diluted share, depending upon exact levels of production.

Jabil also provided guidance for its full fiscal year 2004 indicating that it currently foresees revenue growth of approximately 20 percent or $5.6 to $5.8 billion; core operating earnings growth above 25 percent and core earnings growth above 25 percent or in a range of $0.90 to $0.96 per diluted share.

Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Due to its recent acquisitions and restructuring programs, the Company has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
