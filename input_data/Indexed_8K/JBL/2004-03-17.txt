Our focus for the remainder of the year will be to continuously improve our operational execution, satisfy customer requirements and deliver profitable growth," said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive Officer. The Company provided guidance for its third fiscal quarter of 2004 indicating that it currently foresees revenue in a range of $1.575 to $1.625 billion and core earnings of $0.25 to $0.27 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are currently estimated to be $0.21 to $0.23 per diluted share.

The Company also updated full year guidance, indicating that it currently expects revenue for the year will grow by more than 30 percent to a range of $6.2 to $6.3 billion. Jabil management also indicated that it expects fiscal year core operating income to increase by more than 40 percent and core earnings per share to be in a range of $1.00 to $1.04 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal year are currently estimated to be $0.83 to $0.87 per diluted share.

In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, the Company has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. ( M O R E )
