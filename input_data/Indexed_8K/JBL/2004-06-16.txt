GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal year are currently estimated to be $0.80 to $0.82 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal year are estimated to include $0.20 per share for amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other income/loss.)
Jabil management also provided guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2005, indicating that they currently expect revenue to be in a range of $1.75 to $1.85 billion and core earnings per share to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production.

"We believe the outlook for our business is good and the trend to outsourcing remains strong. We are encouraged that the environment has stabilized and believe that the numerous new customer programs in diverse sectors should be a significant driver for growth as we move into fiscal 2005," said Main.
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Supplemental Information
Due to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, the Company has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
