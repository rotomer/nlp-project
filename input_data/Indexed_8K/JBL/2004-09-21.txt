Jabil provided guidance for its full fiscal year 2005 indicating that it currently foresees revenue in a range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, core earnings growth of 18 to 22 percent and core earnings per share in a range of $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production.

Q4 2004 Earnings Release--Add Three September 21, 2004 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, Jabil has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, a non-GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
