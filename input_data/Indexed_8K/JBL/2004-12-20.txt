St. Petersburg, FL  December 20, 2004
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $55.9 million as compared to $42.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2004.

(Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil reports core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and additional information in the supplemental information below).

Quarterly Highlights
Business Outlook
"We are pleased to have started our fiscal 2005 with another record quarter. We increased net revenues 21 percent, grew core earnings 26 percent and improved diluted core earnings per share 28 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2004," said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While the end markets and the economy are just beginning to show signs of improvement, Jabil clearly has the strong trend for electronics companies to outsource in its favor."
Jabil provided guidance for its second quarter of fiscal 2005 indicating that it currently foresees net revenue in a range of $1.65 to $1.75 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are currently estimated to be $0.22 to $0.24 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
Jabil management maintained its previous full fiscal 2005 guidance, indicating expectations of net revenue to range from $7.2 to $7.4 billion and core earnings per share to be in a range of $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are currently estimated to be $1.05 to $1.09 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.15 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Due to its acquisitions, Jabil has incurred incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings, core earnings per share and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
