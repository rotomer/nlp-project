St. Petersburg, FL  March 17, 2005
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 15 percent to $57.8 million compared to $50.2 million for the same period of fiscal 2004. On a GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $46.0 million as compared to $40.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.22 compared to $0.19 for the same period of fiscal 2004.
Jabil's second quarter of fiscal 2005 core operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 10 percent to $68.1 million or 4.0 percent of net revenue compared to $62.2 million or 4.2 percent of net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Core earnings increased 10 percent to $54.9 million, compared to $49.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Core earnings per share increased 13 percent to $0.27 per diluted share for the period, compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
(Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information below).

Business Outlook
On March 11 Jabil concluded its previously announced intention to acquire the electronics manufacturing business of Varian, Inc.
th
Jabil provided updated guidance for the full fiscal year and its third quarter of fiscal 2005. For the third quarter, Jabil indicated that they currently foresee net revenue in a range of $1.90 to $1.95 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $0.32 to $0.34 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter are currently estimated to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 are currently estimated to include $0.05 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
Jabil management also increased its previous full fiscal 2005 guidance, indicating expectations of net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $1.27 to $1.29 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.18 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Supplemental Information
Jabil has incurred charges from its acquisitions that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the nature of these amounts do not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(1) There were no acquisition-related charges recorded during the six months ended February 28, 2005. During the six months ended February 29, 2004, we recorded acquisition-related charges of $1.3 million ($1.0 million after-tax) primarily in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Royal Philips Electronics and NEC Corporation.
 
(1) The computation of earnings per diluted share and core earnings per diluted share for the three and six months ended February 29, 2004 includes the elimination of $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in interest expense, net of tax. This interest expense is related to the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes, which would have been extinguished had the conversion occurred, as the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive. The notes were redeemed for cash in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.
(2) Diluted common shares for the three and six months ended February 29, 2004 include 8,406,960 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes as the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive. The notes were redeemed for cash in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.
