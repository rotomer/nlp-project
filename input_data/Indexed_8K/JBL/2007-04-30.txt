Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January 17, 2007, Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that on January 12, 2007, its indirect wholly-owned Taiwanese subsidiary, Jabil Circuit (Taiwan) Limited ("Merger Sub"), through a previously-announced tender offer, acquired approximately 260.9 million shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Green Point") (which represented approximately 97.6% of Green Point's outstanding shares) at a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$870.7 million based on then-current exchange rates). Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer and prior to the completion of the acquisition, Merger Sub acquired approximately 2.1 million Green Point shares in block trades for a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$7.0 million based on then-current exchange rates).
The purpose of this Amendment to a Current Report on Form 8-K/A is to announce that on April 24, 2007, Merger Sub completed the acquisition of the approximately 4.1 million remaining outstanding Green Point shares pursuant to the merger agreement entered into on November 22, 2006 (the "Merger"). In completing the Merger, Merger Sub paid a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$13.3 million based on then-current exchange rates) to the remaining Green Point shareholders. Merger Sub is now the sole surviving entity of the Merger.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
