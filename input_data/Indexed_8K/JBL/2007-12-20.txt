(Definitions used: "GAAP"means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)

Business Update
The company expects second fiscal quarter of 2008 net revenue in a range of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 2.2 to 2.4 percent. The guidance is consistent with historical seasonal patterns, particularly prevalent in consumer electronics sectors. Guidance suggests a 25 percent increase in year- over-year core operating income and a 4 percent increase in year-over-year revenue. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its second quarter of fiscal 2008 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.20 per diluted share. GAAP loss per share are estimated to be $(0.03) to $0.01 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.09 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
Jabil said it expects fiscal year 2008 net revenue to range from $13.0 billion to $13.4 billion, with full year core operating income estimated to range from 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent or $400 million to $480 million. The company said its core earnings per share are estimated to be $1.20 to $1.50 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.69 to $.99 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.12 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.17 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.22 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
"In the first half of fiscal 2008, we expect core operating income and EBITDA margins well above previous year levels. In the second half of fiscal 2008, we expect to continue our focus on margin expansion, cash flow generation and higher returns on invested capital. As revenue increases in the second half, cash flow generation and margin expansion is expected to be particularly strong," said Main.
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
