Exhibit 99.1
 
. Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported preliminary, unaudited financial second quarter of fiscal year 2012 net revenue of $4.2 billion. "We are continuing to see the benefits of investing in long-term solutions to drive growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services business," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil. Revenue from Diversified Manufacturing Services increased 33 percent year over year, climbing to 44 percent of total revenue in the second fiscal quarter of 2012.
St. Petersburg, FL  March 20, 2012
"Overall, we are pleased with being able to increase revenue eight percent from our second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2011 and post a solid operating margin," said Main. Jabil indicated its High Velocity business represented 27 percent of total revenue and its Enterprise & Infrastructure business accounted for 29 percent of the quarter's revenue.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)

Business Update
"Our continued focus and investment in Diversified Manufacturing Services is paying off for Jabil," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "We believe Jabil's global expertise in offering customers innovative solutions to their globally complex business needs will continue to allow us to outpace the lackluster global economic conditions in the second half of our fiscal year." Jabil management also provided guidance for its third fiscal quarter of 2012.
 
GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.09 per share for stock-based compensation).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT:
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2012; the benefits of investing in long-term solutions to drive growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services business; the expected lackluster global economic conditions in the second half of our fiscal year; the belief that our global expertise in offering customers innovative solutions to their globally complex business needs will continue to allow us to outpace the expected lackluster conditions and our currently expected third quarter of fiscal year 2012 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; the failure of our investments in long-term solutions to drive growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services business; our inability to deliver innovative solutions to our customers' globally complex business needs; our inability to outpace the expected lackluster economic conditions in the second half of our fiscal year despite delivering the expected innovative solutions to our customers' globally complex business needs; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire (including, with respect to the acquisition of the Italian and French sites, potential unknown liabilities and the costs associated with addressing potential reduced business activity at these sites); risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core return on invested capital, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculation of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.
The following table reconciles (1) "Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax GAAP operating income" to (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income":
