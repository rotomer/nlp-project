(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company, to the extent prepared; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to May 31, 2012, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that there was, as of a date no more than three business days prior to the respective dates of such letters (the "Cut-off Date"), (a) any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt or any decrease in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the May 31, 2012 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, or (b) for the period from June 1, 2012, to the Cut-off Date, any
 
 
decrease, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except (in the case of both (a) and (b)) in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, disclosures have occurred or may occur; and
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
(g) At the Execution Time, the Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to furnish to the Underwriters a letter, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and confirming that they were at all applicable times an independent registered accounting firm within the meaning of the Exchange Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission; and

so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(i) The Securities shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company and any other relevant clearing system.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any
 
 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the information contained in the third paragraph. sixth paragraph (third and fourth sentences only) and tenth paragraph (first sentence only) of the "Underwriting; Conflicts of Interest" section of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or any other written communication.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 11 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 11, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel, if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying
provided
however
 
 
party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
provided
however
 
 
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 11, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 11 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(e) The Company hereby confirms its engagement of the services of SunTrust as, and SunTrust hereby confirms its agreement with the Company to render services as, a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Conduct Rules of FINRA with respect to the offering and sale of the Securities. The Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless SunTrust, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls SunTrust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities incurred as a result of SunTrust's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Conduct Rules of FINRA in connection with the offering of the Securities, or if the indemnification provided for in this Section 11 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless SunTrust, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by SunTrust as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities, based on the factors described in Section 11(d) above.
12. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 12, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
