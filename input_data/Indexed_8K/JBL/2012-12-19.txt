Exhibit 99.1
.Today Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), announced its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The company reported first quarter revenue of $4.6 billion. "Diversified Manufacturing Services increased to 47 percent of our overall business, paced by outstanding growth in Specialized Services," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil.
St. Petersburg, FL  December 19, 2012
Jabil's Diversified Manufacturing Services business grew 20 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 when compared to results of the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company's Enterprise & Infrastructure business increased 17 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 while Jabil's High Velocity business declined 20 percent during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $170 million. Excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, core operating income was $193 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51 cents and core diluted earnings per share was $0.61 cents.
"We are pleased to have generated cash flow from operations of $152 million during the quarter. As a result of this outstanding performance and the ongoing strength of our balance sheet, we were able to return $148 million in capital to shareholders during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 through dividends and share repurchases," said Chief Financial Officer Forbes Alexander. "We see this positive performance continuing and continue to estimate operating cash flow of $1 billion in fiscal 2013," Alexander noted.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)

Repurchased $129 million worth of shares and returned $19 million to shareholders via dividends during the quarter.
Business Update
"Expectations for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 are consistent with seasonal patterns of demand," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "End market demand remains muted in business sectors exposed to government and business spending. Although environmental conditions continue to be uncertain, we maintain our expectation that fiscal 2013 will be another record year for Jabil."
Fiscal Q2 2013 Guidance Range
 
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.08 per share for stock-based compensation).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT: 
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2013; our positive performance continuing, specifically our fiscal year 2013 operating cash flow and our strong balance sheet; our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 being consistent with seasonal patterns of demand; end market demand remaining muted in business sectors exposed to government and business spending; our expectation that fiscal year 2013 will be another company record year for Jabil; and our currently expected second quarter of fiscal year 2013 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2013 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; fluctuations in our stock's market price; fluctuations in operating results and cash flows; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, subsequent Reports on Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculation of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.
The following table reconciles (1) "Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax GAAP operating income" to (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income":
