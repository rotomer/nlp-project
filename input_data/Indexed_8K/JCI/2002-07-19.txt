Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI), a global leader in automotive systems and facility management and control, today reported record sales and earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2002. Sales for the three months ended June 30, 2002 increased 11% to $5.3 billion from $4.7 billion for the same quarter of fiscal 2001. Operating income was $320 million, up 11% over the prior year's $288 million. Net income was a record $175 million, up 15% over the $153 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, 14% over the $1.62 earned last year. Income comparisons are with last year's results that have been adjusted to exclude the effects of goodwill amortization expense. Automotive Systems Group - ------------------------ (dollars in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, Sales by the company's Automotive Systems Group increased 13%. In North America, sales growth of interior systems and batteries was 5% reflecting new interiors and battery business, an increase in domestic industry vehicle production and stronger demand by existing battery customers. -more-
Johnson Controls, Inc. July 18, 2002 Page 2 Revenues from European interiors and battery operations were 33% higher than in the prior year. Most of the increase was due to the inclusion of an electronics business and a battery business that were acquired in October 2001 and the effect of favorable currency rates. Revenues excluding those factors rose 8% due to newly launched interiors systems business. Sales in Asia were modestly higher while revenue in South America declined due to depressed market conditions. Operating income for the group increased 12% to $254 million from $226 million for the comparative quarter. Income increased in North America reflecting the higher volumes and improvements in quality and costs. In Europe, operating margins were lower as the result of higher new program launch and engineering costs. Controls Group - -------------- (dollars in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, Controls Group sales to the nonresidential buildings market for the third quarter increased 5%. Excluding acquisitions and the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Japan, sales for the quarter would have been 8% higher year-over-year. North American sales increased 11% reflecting a higher level of activity associated with control system installation contracts. Revenues associated with control services and facility management, especially for the federal government, were also higher. Sales in Europe were 15% higher reflecting a higher level of facility management activity and revenue associated with an acquisition completed late in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. In Asia, sales declined substantially due to the joint venture deconsolidation. Operating income rose 7% over the year ago quarter, and higher operating margins were achieved in both North America and Europe due to quality and cost improvements. Johnson Controls said that the backlog of uncompleted contracts for installed systems was 13% higher than at June 30 one year ago. An increase in orders for installed systems reflects strength in demand in the North American health care, education and office building sectors. -more-
Johnson Controls, Inc. July 18, 2002 Page 3 Year-To-Date Results and Outlook - -------------------------------- Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2002 rose 8% to $14.9 billion from $13.8 billion for the same period of fiscal 2001. Operating income increased 7% to $778 million from the prior year's $724 million. Net income was 11% higher at $410 million versus $370 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2001. Diluted earnings per share were $4.33, 10% above the $3.95 for 2001. James H. Keyes, chairman and chief executive officer, said "With nine months of our fiscal year complete, we are pleased to confirm our full-year outlook for record sales and earnings. We are confident that we will be able to exceed our forecast for 6% sales growth by our automotive group due to strength in the domestic vehicle market. We continue to look for automotive operating margins to approximate last year's level. Sales growth for our controls group is estimated to be at the lower end of the previously estimated 6-10% range, with modest margin improvement. In addition, our free cash flow is strong as evidenced by our total debt to total capitalization decreasing to 39% at June 30, 2002 as compared with 41% three months earlier. "I would like to thank our employees for their commitment to exceed our customers' expectations, as well as our shareholders for their support as we anticipate achieving our 12th consecutive year of record earnings." -more-

Page 8 FOOTNOTES 1. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", effective October 1, 2001. Under FAS 142 goodwill will no longer be amortized; however, it must be tested for impairment at least annually. Amortization will continue to be recorded for other intangible assets with determinable lives. The Company's financial statements include comparative adjusted information which assumes FAS 142 had been adopted October 1, 2000. 2. Effective October 1, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the automotive electronics business of France-based Sagem SA and the German automotive battery manufacturer Hoppecke Automotive GmbH & Co. KG. Both acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. The acquisitions, with an initial combined purchase price of approximately $575 million, were financed with long-term debt. Independent appraisals and other studies necessary to allocate purchase price to the acquired net assets are in progress. Pending completion of the appraisals and studies, the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the acquired net assets has been reported as goodwill. 3. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income, after deducting dividend requirements on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings are computed by deducting from net income the after-tax compensation expense which would arise from the assumed conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, which was $0.6 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $2.1 million and $2.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Diluted weighted average shares assume the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, if dilutive, plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents which would arise from the exercise of stock options. ###
