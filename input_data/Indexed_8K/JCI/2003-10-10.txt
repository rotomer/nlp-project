On October 8, 2003, Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) entered into new 364-day and five-year revolving credit facilities. The existing 364-day $500 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in March 2004, was increased to $625 million and was extended to October 2004. JCI's existing five-year revolving credit facility, expiring March 2006, was also increased to $625 million from $500 million and was extended to October 2008. These bank credit facilities, with JPMorgan Chase Bank acting as Administrative Agent on behalf of itself and 12 other banks, continue to be available to JCI to meet commercial paper maturities and operating needs. As of October 10, 2003 there were no borrowings outstanding under either of these facilities.
