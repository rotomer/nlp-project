On May 14, 2004, Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) notified its bondholders that it will redeem in full the $125 million of outstanding principal of its 8.2% bonds due in 2024 plus accrued interest on June 15, 2004. JCI will pay a call premium of 4.1%, approximately $5.1 million, to redeem the outstanding bonds, and plans to fund the redemption with short-term borrowings. The call premium together with the write-off of the remaining portion of unamortized debt issuance costs, will result in a one-time pre-tax charge of approximately $6.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. JCI issued the bonds in 1994.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
