Item 8.01    Other Events.
     Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") is undertaking to meet the requirements of Rule 416(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and item 512(a) of Regulation S-K, regarding its Registration Statement No. 333-59594 (the "DRIP/CSPP Registration Statement") relating to the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). Under Rule 416(b), if additional securities are issued as a result of a stock split prior to the completion of the distribution of the securities covered by a registration statement, then the additional securities are covered by the registration statement, provided that the registration statement is amended. On January 2, 2004, the Company effected a 2-for-1 split (the "Stock Split") of its outstanding common stock ("Common Stock"). In connection with the Stock Split, the par value of the Common Stock was changed from $0.16 2/3 per share to $0.04 1/6 per share.
     The DRIP/CSPP Registration Statement registered 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be sold pursuant to the Plan. Pursuant to Rule 416(b), by virtue of this filing, the DRIP/CSPP Registration Statement is deemed to cover the additional shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of the Stock Split.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
