Exhibit 99.1
     MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, October 24, 2005 ... Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) today reported that its fourth quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations rose 15% on a sales increase of 7%.
     John M. Barth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said "We are pleased to report record quarterly and full-year results, continuing our track record for growth. In 2005 we broadened our capabilities, expanded our addressable markets and strengthened the foundation for improved profitability. Our company enters 2006 as the global leader in each of our businesses and with a strong financial position. We appreciate the efforts of our employees and their commitment to increase the value we deliver to our customers and our shareholders."
     Johnson Controls sales for the 2005 fourth quarter totaled $6.9 billion, up 7% from $6.4 billion last year. Operating income was $436 million, up 14% from $384 million last year. Income from continuing operations totaled $293 million, up 15% from $255 million in the 2004 period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the 2005 fourth quarter were $1.50 versus $1.31 in the prior year.
     During the fourth quarter, the company recorded an $8.7 million adjustment, net of tax, reducing the gain on sale of discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2005. Including this one-time reduction, diluted earnings per share were $1.45, up from $1.41.
     Interior experience sales were $4.5 billion, up 4% from the $4.4 billion in the prior year. The increase was associated with the launch of new business which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of a North American joint venture during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the deconsolidation, sales for the fourth quarter would have increased 9%. Industry light vehicle production in North America is estimated to have been approximately 3% higher than the prior year amount while European production is estimated to have been 2-3% lower. Operating income declined 13%, to $206 million versus $238 million for the 2004 fourth quarter, primarily due to higher commodity costs which more than offset the benefit of operational improvements.
     Power solutions sales increased 37% to $864 million from $632 million last year as a result of organic growth in North America and Europe, the impact of the Delphi battery acquisition and the consolidation of a Latin American joint venture in late 2004. Operating income rose 79% to $114
 
million from $64 million, reflecting the higher volume, favorable product mix, improved quality and operational efficiencies.
     Building efficiency sales increased 5% to $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter from $1.4 billion in 2004, primarily due to higher North American systems and services activity for both new construction and existing buildings. Operating income was $115 million, 40% above the 2004 amount of $83 million, reflecting growth of higher-margin service business and the timing of benefits associated with efficiency and cost improvement initiatives in the North American branch office network. The backlog of uncompleted contracts at the end of 2005 was 5% higher than one year ago.
Financial Position
     Capital expenditures for the 2005 fiscal year decreased to $675 million, in line with earlier guidance. At September 30, 2005, the company's total debt to total capitalization declined to 28% from 34% at the prior year-end, despite funding acquisitions and the company's voluntary $180 million contribution to its U.S. pension plans in July.
Fiscal 2006 Guidance
     On October 11, 2005, Johnson Controls issued guidance on its expected performance for 2006. Fiscal 2006 sales are anticipated to increase approximately 15%, to $32 billion. Earnings per share from continuing operations are estimated to increase 13 to 17%, to a range of $5.00 to $5.15. For the first quarter of 2006, Johnson Controls said it anticipates sales of $6.8 billion and earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.82 to $0.85.
     The company said it expects that its previously announced acquisition of York International will be completed in December 2005.

Johnson Controls has made forward-looking statements in this document pertaining to its financial results for 2006 that are based on preliminary data and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future risks and may include words such as "believes," "forecasts," "expects," "outlook" or similar expressions. For those statements, the company cautions that numerous important factors, such as completion of the acquisition of York International in December 2005, automotive vehicle production levels and schedules, the ability to increase prices due to higher raw material costs, the strength of the U.S. or other economies, currency exchange rates, the company's effective tax rate, cancellation of commercial contracts, as well as those factors discussed in the company's Form 8-K (dated October 7, 2005) could affect the company's actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, the company.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
 
1. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) are computed by dividing net income, after deducting dividend requirements on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings are computed by deducting from net income the after-tax compensation expense which would arise from the assumed conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, which was $0 and $0.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Effective December 31, 2003, the Company converted all the outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and accordingly there was no after-tax compensation expense for the three or twelve months ended September 30, 2005. Diluted weighted average shares assume the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, if dilutive, plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents which would arise from the exercise of stock options.

3. Discontinued Operations
In February 2005, the Company completed the sale of its engine electronics business, included in interior experience  Europe segment, to Valeo for approximately 316 million Euros, or about $419 million. This non-core business was acquired in fiscal 2002 from Sagem SA. As part of the post-closing activities, the Company settled a claim with Valeo for approximately $8 million ($5 million after tax), resulting in an adjustment to the purchase price. The sale of the engine electronics business resulted in a gain of approximately $81 million ($51 million after tax), net of related costs.
 
In March 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Johnson Controls World Services, Inc. subsidiary (World Services), included in the building efficiency segment, to IAP Worldwide Services, Inc. for approximately $260 million. This non-strategic business was acquired in fiscal 1989 from Pan Am Corporation. As part of the post-closing activities, the Company has provided approximately $4 million ($3 million after tax) for certain contingencies related to the sale. The sale of World Services resulted in a gain of approximately $139 million ($85 million after tax), net of related costs.
Both the engine electronics business and World Services are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."
4. Restructuring Costs
In the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $210 million involving cost structure reduction actions, primarily relating to severance costs and facility consolidations. The majority of the actions are concentrated on the interior experience operations in Europe as the Company focuses on further improving profitability in the region.
