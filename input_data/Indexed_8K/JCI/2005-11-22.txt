Item 1.01
Entry into Material Agreement
                      Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") maintains the Johnson Controls, Inc. 2001 Restricted Stock Plan (the "Restricted Stock Plan") and from time to time grants restricted stock awards to executive officers and other key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries under the Restricted Stock Plan. On November 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved awards of restricted stock to executive officers of the Company under the Restricted Stock Plan that will be effective January 3, 2006. The awards will provide for a vesting period of 50% after 2 years from award effective date and the remaining 50% after 4 years from award effective date. Pending vesting, recipients will be able to vote the shares. Any dividends paid with respect to unvested shares will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including risk of forfeiture) as the unvested shares to which they relate. Shares vest in full upon death or disability. In the event of retirement, vesting continues assuming the recipient does not engage in inimical conduct. Any other termination of employment results in the forfeiture of unvested shares.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
