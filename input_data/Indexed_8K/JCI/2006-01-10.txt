            (b)        The Representatives shall have received the opinion of Jerome D. Okarma, Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

            (c)        The Representatives shall have received the opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

            (e)        The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, solely in their respective capacities as such, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any amendments or supplements thereto and this Agreement and that:
            (f)        At the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
        References to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any amendments or supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
        In addition, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, at the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth above.
            (g)        Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the effect of which in any case referred to in paragraph (f)(i) or (ii) of this Section 6, is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
            (h)        Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purpose of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
            (i)        Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
        If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
        7.       . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
        8.       . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
            (b)        Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, in the third paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" relating to concessions and reallowances and in the sixth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
            (c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
            (d)        In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
        9.       . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
        10.       . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred (1) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, act of terrorism, attack on the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or (2) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, and, with respect to either (1) or (2) above, the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
Termination
        11.       . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
        12.       . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed and confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 5757 North Green Bay Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209, Attention: Secretary.
Notices
        13.       . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
        14.       . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
No Fiduciary Duty
        15.        . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Integration
        16.        . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York.
Applicable Law
        17.       . This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Johnson Controls, Inc. 5757 Green Bay Avenue Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I am Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), and have advised the Company in connection with the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-130714) (the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated December 27, 2005, and the final supplement to the prospectus, dated January 9, 2006 (collectively, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate amount of the Company's floating rate notes due 2008, $800,000,000 aggregate amount of the Company's 5.250% fixed rate notes due 2011, $800,000,000 aggregate amount of the Company's 5.500% fixed rate notes due 2016 and $400,000,000 aggregate amount of the Company's 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2036, each in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (collectively, the "Debt Securities"). The Debt Securities will be issued under the Senior Indenture, to be dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and the officer's certificate, to be dated January 17, 2006 (the "Officer's Certificate"), establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the Debt Securities.
        In my capacity as Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of the Company in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of the Securities, I have examined or am otherwise familiar with (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company; (ii) the By-Laws of the Company, as amended to date; (iii) the Registration Statement, including the exhibits thereto; (iv) the Indenture and the Officer's Certificate; (v) the corporate proceedings taken by the Board of Directors of the Company to authorize the filing of the Registration Statement and the issuance of the Securities; and (vi) such other documents, records and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.
        In my examination of the above-referenced documents, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
        Based upon the foregoing, assuming that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that the Debt Securities, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and the Officer's Certificate and in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms.
        The opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that the enforceability of any contract or agreement or of any security or other instrument issued thereunder may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally and to court decisions with respect thereto and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
        I am qualified to practice law in the State of Wisconsin, and I do not purport to be an expert on the law other than that of the State of Wisconsin and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin and the federal laws of the United States. To the extent matters covered by my opinion are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin or the federal laws of the United States, I have assumed, without independent investigation, that the applicable laws of such jurisdiction are identical in all relevant respects to the substantive laws of the State of Wisconsin.
        I hereby consent to the deemed incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and to the reference to me therein. In giving such consent, I do not admit that I am an "expert" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
