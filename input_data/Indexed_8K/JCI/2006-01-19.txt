Item 1.01
Entry into Material Definitive Agreement
        On January 9, 2006, Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Underwriters") pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to and upon terms and conditions set forth therein, $2.5 billion in floating and fixed rate notes consisting of the following four series:
,
(a)     $500 Million  2-year floating rate notes, priced at par, to yield three-month LIBOR plus twenty three basis points (the "Floating Rate Notes");

The offering of the Debt Securities closed on January 17, 2006.
        In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Underwriters or their affiliates have engaged, or may in the future engage, in a full range of treasury services with the Company or its affiliates, including commercial banking or investment banking transactions, investment management and currency and derivative trading, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Additionally, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. is serving as trustee for the Debt Securities.
        The Debt Securities were issued under the Senior Indenture (the "Indenture"), between the Company and J.P.

        Each series of the Debt Securities is subject to the Registration Statement that the Company filed with the SEC relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the Company filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated January 9, 2006, and prospectus, dated December 27, 2005, relating to the public offering of the Debt Securities, the Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 4.1
Pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Indenture dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), the undersigned on behalf of the Company and in their respective capacities indicated, hereby certify that we have examined resolutions duly adopted at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company on August 24, 2005 and the action of authorized officers of the Company, dated January 9, 2006. Acting pursuant to such resolutions and such action, the undersigned hereby establish a series of Debt Securities (the "Floating Rate Notes") by means of this Officers' Certificate, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01 of the Indenture:
        Capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture are used herein as so defined.
Dated: January 17, 2006
        
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository Trust Company, a New York Corporation (the "Depositary"), to the Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
CUSIP 478366AP2
        JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000,000) on January 17, 2008, and to pay interest thereon from January 17, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on January 17, April 17, July 17 and October 17 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing April 17, 2006, at a floating rate of interest until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Floating Rate Note Due 2008 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day prior to the Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
The interest rate on the Notes for the interest period beginning the date of this Note and ending on the first Interest Reset Date (as defined below) will be equal to the three-month London interbank offer rate ("LIBOR"), determined in the manner set forth below, plus twenty three (23) basis points. The interest rate on the Notes for each subsequent interest period will be reset quarterly on each Interest Payment Date (an "Interest Reset Date"), and the Notes will bear interest at an annual rate (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year) equal to LIBOR, determined in the manner set forth below, plus twenty three (23) basis points.
The interest rate in effect for the Notes on each day will be (a) if that day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Determination Date (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (b) if that day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date. The "Determination Date" will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date.
LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent as of the applicable Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
If the date of maturity of the Notes falls on a day that is not a LIBOR Business Day, the related payment of principal and interest will be made on the next LIBOR Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next LIBOR Business Day. If any Interest Reset Date or Interest Payment Date (other than at the date of maturity) would otherwise be a day that is not a LIBOR Business Day, that Interest Reset Date and Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next date that is a LIBOR Business Day, except that if such LIBOR Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date and Interest Payment Date (other than at the date of maturity) shall be the immediately preceding LIBOR Business Day.
"LIBOR Business Day" means any day other than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions or trust companies in the City of New York are required or authorized to close and that is also a London Business Day.
"London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
        This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
        The Notes will not be redeemable prior to maturity.
        The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
        If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
        With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the time or terms of payment of the principal at maturity of, or the interest on, any such series of Debt Securities, or reduce principal or premium or the rate of interest, without the consent of the Holder thereof, or (b) without the consent of all of the Holders of any series of Debt Securities then outstanding, reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any such series, the Holders of which are required to consent (i) to any such supplemental indenture, (ii) to rescind and annul a declaration that the Debt Securities of any series are due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (iii) to waive any past Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences and (iv) to waive compliance with certain other provisions contained in the Indenture.

        The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
        Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

        The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
        Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Debt Security Registrar (initially JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) in the registry books maintained by such Debt Security Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
        No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
        This Note is in the form of a Global Security as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Global Security representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association,   As Trustee
By:       Authorized Officer
/s/ Albert Mari                  
        Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
        Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
        This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
        All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Redemption Price for the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 15 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
        For the purposes of determining the Redemption Price, "Treasury Rate" means, (i) with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediate preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculating using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as specified by us, or, if all three firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by us. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors, provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we will substitute for such Primary Treasury Dealer another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
        The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
        If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
        With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the time or terms of payment of the principal at maturity of, or the interest on, any such series of Debt Securities, or reduce principal or premium or the rate of interest, without the consent of the Holder thereof, or (b) without the consent of all of the Holders of any series of Debt Securities then outstanding, reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any such series, the Holders of which are required to consent (i) to any such supplemental indenture, (ii) to rescind and annul a declaration that the Debt Securities of any series are due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (iii) to waive any past Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences and (iv) to waive compliance with certain other provisions contained in the Indenture.
        The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture.
        The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
        Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
        The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
        Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive.

        JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of Three Hundred Million and 00/100 Dollars ($300,000,000) on January 15, 2011, and to pay interest thereon from January 17, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2006, at the rate of 5.250% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 5.250% Note Due 2011 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

By:       Authorized Officer
/s/ Albert Mari                   
        Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
        Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
        This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
        All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Redemption Price for the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 15 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
        For the purposes of determining the Redemption Price, "Treasury Rate" means, (i) with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediate preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculating using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as specified by us, or, if all three firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by us. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors, provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we will substitute for such Primary Treasury Dealer another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
        The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
        If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
        With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the time or terms of payment of the principal at maturity of, or the interest on, any such series of Debt Securities, or reduce principal or premium or the rate of interest, without the consent of the Holder thereof, or (b) without the consent of all of the Holders of any series of Debt Securities then outstanding, reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any such series, the Holders of which are required to consent (i) to any such supplemental indenture, (ii) to rescind and annul a declaration that the Debt Securities of any series are due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (iii) to waive any past Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences and (iv) to waive compliance with certain other provisions contained in the Indenture.
        The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture.
        The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
        Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
        The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
        Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Debt Security Registrar (initially JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) in the registry books maintained by such Debt Security Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
        No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name a Note is registered as the owner for all purposes whether or not such Note be overdue and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
        Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
        This Note is in the form of a Global Security as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Global Security representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.
        No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Indenture, any supplemental indenture, or of any Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect thereof shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any Subsidiary or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liabilities being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

        JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of Three Hundred Million and 00/100 Dollars ($300,000,000) on January 15, 2016, and to pay interest thereon from January 17, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2006, at the rate of 5.500% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 5.500% Note Due 2016 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association,   As Trustee
By:       Authorized Officer
/s/ Albert Mari                   
        Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
        Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
        This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
        All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Redemption Price for the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
        For the purposes of determining the Redemption Price, "Treasury Rate" means, (i) with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediate preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculating using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as specified by us, or, if all three firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by us. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors, provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we will substitute for such Primary Treasury Dealer another Primary Treasury Dealer and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
        The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
        If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
        With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the time or terms of payment of the principal at maturity of, or the interest on, any such series of Debt Securities, or reduce principal or premium or the rate of interest, without the consent of the Holder thereof, or (b) without the consent of all of the Holders of any series of Debt Securities then outstanding, reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any such series, the Holders of which are required to consent (i) to any such supplemental indenture, (ii) to rescind and annul a declaration that the Debt Securities of any series are due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (iii) to waive any past Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences and (iv) to waive compliance with certain other provisions contained in the Indenture.
        The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture.
        The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
        Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
        The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
        Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Debt Security Registrar (initially JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) in the registry books maintained by such Debt Security Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
        No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name a Note is registered as the owner for all purposes whether or not such Note be overdue and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
        Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
        This Note is in the form of a Global Security as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Global Security representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.
        No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Indenture, any supplemental indenture, or of any Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect thereof shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any Subsidiary or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liabilities being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
        The Notes are subject to defeasance at the option of the Company as provided in the Indenture.
        All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
