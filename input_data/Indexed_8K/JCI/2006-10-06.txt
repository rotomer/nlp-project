The Company performs an assessment at least quarterly of important business and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of Johnson Controls or its management and provides this disclosure for purposes of Regulation FD.

CHANGES IN LABOR FORCE The effects of labor strikes/work stoppages, or other interruptions at the Companys manufacturing facilities or those of its significant customers and/or suppliers; difficulties in securing employees in major markets where the Company purchases material, components, and supplies or where the Companys products are produced, distributed or sold; the ability to successfully implement and complete previously announced and planned headcount reductions and changes to the Companys global manufacturing footprint.

CHANGES IN COMPANY STRUCTURE Start-up expenses incurred by expanding the Company, including inefficiencies and delays; the continued successful implementation of the Companys restructuring initiatives as well as other profitability improvement programs; underutilization of plants and factories, including plant expansions, resulting in production inefficiencies and higher costs; the Companys ability to recover engineering and tooling costs; the successful completion of acquisitions and divestitures; the Companys ability to realize acq uisition related integration benefits; amount, rate and growth in Johnson Controls' selling, general and administrative expenses (e.g., healthcare and/or pension costs); impact of unusual items resulting from on-going evaluations of business strategies, asset valuations, acquisitions, divestitures and organizational structures. CHANGES IN WEATHER CONDITIONS Unseasonably cool weather in various parts of the world could adversely affect the Companys global air conditioning equipment sales. CHANGES IN REGULATORY, FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS Effects stemming from changes in trade policies, laws, regulations, activities of governmental agencies, environmental and other regulations governing the HVAC&R markets, monetary policies, fiscal policies, and other social economic conditions such as trade restrictions or prohibitions; inflation and other monetary fluctuations; the effect of adoption of new accounting standards; import and other charges or taxes; currency exchange rate fluctuations and Johnson Controls ability to hedge against foreign exchange rates; the existence of unstable governments and legal systems which may impact Johnson Controls continuity of business and ability to obtain authorizations and licensing; possible effects of new legislation; changes in domestic and foreign tax regulations, and the successful resolution of ongoing and pending tax audits that may affect the Companys applicable tax rates.

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY Persistence of long-term economic uncertainty in Asia, Latin and South America, eastern Europe, the Middle East and other emerging markets in which Johnson Controls competes; other economic changes that may effect the adequacy of cash flows from operations to cover capital needs and debt. CHANGES DUE TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM Effects of potential terrorist sponsored events on the Companys business, which could include accelerating or exacerbating automotive or controls industry risks such as those noted above in this disclosure, heightening Johnson Controls business interruption-related risk such as disruption in supply chains, or increasing liability claims against the Company arising out of commercial facilities the Company has operated or to which the Company has supplied building equipment and systems.
