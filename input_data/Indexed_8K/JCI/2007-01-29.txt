Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
At the annual meeting of shareholders of Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") held on January 24, 2007, the Companys shareholders approved the Johnson Controls, Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan replaces the Johnson Controls, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan (the "2000 Plan"), which was approved by the Companys shareholders in 2000. The 2007 Plan has two complementary purposes: (i) to attract and retain outstanding individuals to serve as officers and employees and (ii) to increase shareholder value. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors and, with respect to non-executive officers of the Company, the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Any officer or other employee of the Company or its affiliates, or an individual that the Company or an affiliate has engaged to become an office or employee, is eligible to be granted awards under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan provides that up to a max imum of 12,283,702 shares of the Companys common stock (subject to adjustment) are available for issuance thereunder. This number is comprised of (1) 2,283,702 shares of common stock that remain available for grant under the 2000 Plan, and (2) 10,000,000 additional shares of common stock. The 2007 Plan authorizes the granting to key employees of: (a) stock options, which may be either incentive stock options meeting the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or non-qualified stock options; and (b) stock appreciation rights. The 2007 Plan is described in detail in the Companys proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Schedule 14A in connection with the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on January 24, 2007. The foregoing description of the 2007 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2007 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Curren t Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
