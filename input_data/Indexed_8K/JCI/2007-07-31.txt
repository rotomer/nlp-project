Date: July 31, 2007
 
(3.1) Composite Restated Articles of Incorporation of Johnson Controls, Inc., as amended through July 26, 2007.
(99.1) Press release of Johnson Controls, Inc. dated July 26, 2007.

 
Exhibit 3.1
     Pursuant to the authority and provisions of Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the existing Articles of Incorporation are hereby amended, superseded and restated to read as follows:
     The name of the corporation is Johnson Controls, Inc.
     The corporation is organized for the purpose of any lawful activity within the purposes for which corporations may be organized under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statues, including (without in any manner limiting by the following enumeration the generality of the foregoing) the manufacture, sale and installation of, and dealing in, automatic temperature and humidity controls for heating, cooling, ventilating, air-conditioning and industrial processing.
The aggregate number of shares which this Corporation has authority to issue is 1,802,000,000* shares, consisting of 1,800,000,000 shares of class of designated "Common Stock" of the par value of $0.01-7/18 per share and 2,000,000 shares of class designated "Preferred Stock" of the par value of $1.00 per share. Any and all such shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be issued for such consideration, not less than the par value thereof, as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any and all such shares so issued, the full consideration for which has been paid or delivered, shall be deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to any further call or assessment thereon, and the holders of such share shall not be liable for any further payments except as otherwise provided by applicable Wisconsin Statutes. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Board of Directors shall have no authority to cause any shares of Preferred Stock to be issued if, as a result of such issuance, the aggregate amount payable in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation on all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding would exceed $100,000,000. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of each class shall be as follows:
 
(A) Preferred Stock
     (1) Series of Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors shall (have) authority to divide the Preferred Stock into series, and shall determine and fix the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established prior to the issuance thereof, but only with respect to:
     (a) The rate of dividend and the date from which such dividends shall be cumulative;
     (b) The price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be redeemed;
     (c) The amount payable upon shares in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation;
     (d) Sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of share;
     (e) The terms and conditions on which shares may be converted into shares of Common Stock, if the shares or any series are issued with the privilege of conversion.
     (f) Voting rights, if any.
 
     Except as to the matters expressly set forth above in this Paragraph (1), all series of the Preferred Stock of the corporation, whenever designated and issued, shall have the same preferences, limitations and relative rights and shall rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.
     All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock hereinabove authorized shall be alike in every particular, and each series thereof shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words or figures.
     (2) Dividends
The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate per annum specified as to each series pursuant to Paragraph (1), and no more, payable quarterly on the last day of March, June, September, and December in each year for the respective calendar quarter ending on such dates ("Dividend Periods") out of the unreserved earned surplus of the corporation or out of any capital surplus legally available for the payment of such dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall accrue on each share of Preferred Stock from the first day of the Dividend Period in which such share is issued or from such other date as the Board of Directors may fix for this purpose pursuant to Paragraph (1). All dividends on Preferred Stock shall be cumulative so that if the corporation shall not pay or set apart for payment the dividend, or any part thereof, for any Dividend Period, on the Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding, such deficiency in the dividend on the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be fully paid or declared and set apart for payment, but without interest before any dividend shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment on the Common Stock. The holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any other or additional earnings or profits of the corporation, except for such premiums, if any, as may be payable in case of redemption, liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Any dividend paid upon the Preferred Stock at a time when any accrued dividends for any prior Dividend Period are delinquent shall be expressly declared to be in whole or partial payment of the accrued dividends to the extent thereof, beginning with the earliest Dividend Period for which dividends are then wholly or partly delinquent, and shall be so designated to each shareholder to whom payment is made.
No dividends shall be paid upon any shares of any series of Preferred Stock of the corporation for a current Dividend Period unless there shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment dividends required to be paid to the holders of each other series of Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods of such other series. If any dividends are paid on any of the Preferred Stock with respect to any past Dividend Period at any time when less than the total dividends then accumulated and payable for all past Dividend Periods on all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding are to be paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the dividends being paid shall be paid on each series of Preferred Stock in proportions that the dividends than accumulated and payable on each series for all past Dividend Periods bear to the total dividends then accumulated and payable for all such past Dividend Periods on all outstanding Preferred Stock.
     (3) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
     In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation in money or money's worth the amount specified pursuant to Paragraph (1) with respect to that series of Preferred Stock, together with all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared), before any of such assets shall be paid or distributed to holders of Common Stock. In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, if the assets shall be insufficient to pay the holders of all of the series of Preferred stock then outstanding the full amounts to which they may be entitled, the holders of each outstanding series shall share ratably in such assets in proportion to the amounts which would be payable with respect to such series if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. The consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into nay restoration, or a sale of all or any part of its assets, shall not be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of this paragraph.
     (4) Redemption
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to a particular series pursuant to Paragraph (1), the following general redemption provisions shall apply to each series of Preferred stock (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as "Series"):
     On or prior to the date fixed for redemption of a particular Series or any part thereof as specified in the notice of redemption for said Series, the corporation shall deposit adequate funds for such redemption, in trust for the
 
account of holders of the Series to be redeemed, with a bank having trust company in good standing organized under the laws of the United States of America or the State of Wisconsin doing business in the State of Wisconsin and having capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and if the name and address of such bank or trust company and the deposit of or intent to deposit the redemption funds in such trust account shall have been stated in such notice of redemption, them from and after the mailing of such notice and the making of such deposit the shares of the Series called for redemption no longer be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and all rights of the holders of such share in or with respect to the corporation shall forthwith cease and terminate except only the right of the holders of such shares (2) to transfer such shares prior to the date fixed for redemption, (b) to receive out of said deposit the redemption price of such shares, which shall nevertheless include accrued but unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed, and (c) to exercise on or before the close of business on the fifth day preceding the date fixed for redemption privileges of conversion, if any, not theretofore expired.
     In case of redemption of only a part of a Series, the corporation shall designate by lot, in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine, the share to be redeemed, or shall effect such redemption pro rata.
     Any moneys so deposited by the corporation which shall remain unclaimed by the holders of the shares called for redemption and not converted shall, at the end of six years after the date fixed for redemption, be paid to the corporation upon its request, after which repayment the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall no longer look to the said bank or trust company for the payment of the redemption price but shall look only to the corporation or to others, as the case may be, for the payment of any lawful claim for such moneys which holders of said shares may still have. After said six-year period, the right of any shareholder other person to receive such payment may be forfeited in the manner and with the effect provided under Wisconsin Law. Any portion of the moneys so deposited by the corporation, in respect of shares of the Series converted into Common Stock, shall be repaid to the corporation upon its request.
     (5) Conversion Rights
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to a particular series pursuant to Paragraph (1), the following general conversion provisions shall apply to each series of Preferred Stock which is convertible into Common Stock (hereinafter, in this paragraph, referred to as "Series"):
     (a) All shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion shall be fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be free of all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof except taxes, if any, payable by reason of issuance in a name other than that of the holder of the share or shares converted and except as otherwise provided by applicable Wisconsin Statutes.
     (b) The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a particular Series at any time shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate conversion value, as herein provided, of the shares of that Series surrendered for conversion, by the price per share of Common Stock then in effect for that Series as herein provided. The corporation shall not be required, however, upon any such conversion, to issue any fractional share of Common Stock, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay to the shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional share if issued, a sum in case equal to the value of such fractional share at the rate of the then market value per share of Common Stock which for purposes hereof shall mean the last reported sale price of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Share of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of receipt at the office of the Transfer Agent of the certificates therefor, duly endorsed, together with written notice by the holder of his election to convert the same.
     (c) The basic conversion price per share of Common Stock for a particular Series, as provided for under the detailed description of the individual Series, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
          (i) In Case the corporation shall (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution of all holders of outstanding shares of its Common Stock as a class in shares of its Common Stock, (B) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of its Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (C) combine the outstanding shares of its Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the base conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted retroactively so that the holder of each outstanding share of each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the conversion of such share the number of shares of Common Stock of the corporation which he would have owned and been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such share of such Series been converted
 
immediately prior to the happening of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (i) shall become effective retroactively immediately after such record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, split or combination. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
          (ii) In case the corporation shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock as a class any rights or warrants enabling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) at the record date fir determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the basic conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto for each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall be adjusted retroactively by multiplying such basic conversion price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such record date and the number of share of Common Stock which the aggregate exercise price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and other expenses of the corporation in connection with the issue) of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price per share of which the denominator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such record date and the number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (ii) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
          (iii) In case the corporation shall distribute to all holders of its Common Stock as a class evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends), the basic conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto for each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall be adjusted retroactively by multiplying such basis conversion price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the difference between the current market price per share per share of Common Stock at the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution and the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends) so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall be the current market price per share of Common Stock. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (iii) shall become effective retroactively immediately after such record date. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
     (d) For the purpose of any computation under clause (c) (iii) above, the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the high and low sale prices of the Common Stock of the corporation, as reported in the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions (or such other principal market quotation as may then be applicable to such Common Stock) for each of the 30 consecutive trading days commencing 45 trading days before such date.
     (e) For the purpose of making the computations prescribed in clause (c) of this Paragraph (5), no adjustment shall be made in the basic conversion price for any Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such computation if the amount of such adjustment would be less than fifty cents; provided however, that any adjustments which by reason of this clause (e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and provided further that anything to the contrary in the foregoing notwithstanding any adjustment required for purposes of making the computations in said clause (c) shall be made not later than the earlier of (x) 3 years after the effective date provided for under said clause (c) for such adjustment or (y) the date as of which such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 3% in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the first date on which an event occurred which required the making of a computation prescribed in said clause (c). All calculations under this Paragraph (5) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be."
     (f) In the case of any capital reorganization or reclassification of Common Stock, or if the corporation shall be consolidated with or merged into, or sell or dispose of all substantially all of its property and assets, to any other corporation, proper provisions shall be made as part of the terms of such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale that any shares of a particular Series at the time outstanding shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares of a particular Series would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger.
 
     (g) No adjustment with respect to dividends upon any Series or with respect to dividends upon Common Stock shall be made in connection with any conversion.
     (h) Whenever there is an issue of additional shares Common Stock of the corporation requiring a change in the conversion price as provided above, and whenever there occurs any other event which results in a change in the existing conversion rights of the holders of shares of a series, the corporation shall file and its transfer agent or agents and at its principal office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a statement signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, describing specifically such issue of additional shares of Common Stock or such other event (and, in the case of a capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, the terms thereof) and the actual conversion prices or basis of conversion as changed by such issue or event and the change, if any, in the securities issuable upon conversion. Whenever there are issued by the corporation to all holders of its Common Stock as a class any rights or warrants enabling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, the corporation shall also file in like manner a statement describing the same and the consideration receivable by the corporation therefrom. The statement so filed shall be open to inspection by any holder of record of shares of any Series.
     (i) The corporation shall at all times have authorized and shall at all times reserve and set aside a sufficient number of duly authorized shares of Common Stock for the conversion of all stock of all then outstanding Series which are convertible into Common Stock.
     (6) Reissuance of Shares
     Any shares of Preferred Stock retired by purchase, redemption, through conversion or through the operation of any sinking fund or redemption or purchase account, shall thereafter have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation, and may thereafter be reissued as part of the same series or may be reclassified and reissued by the Board of Directors in the same manner as any other authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock.
     (7) Voting Rights of Preferred Stock
          (a) Ordinary Voting Rights. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such class held on all questions on which shareholders of the corporation are entitled to vote and shall vote together share for share with the holders of Common Stock as one class, except as otherwise provided by law or as hereinafter otherwise provided or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the establishment of such Series of Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (f) of Paragraph (1) of this Section (A).
          (b) Special Voting Rights. Holders of Preferred Stock shall have voting rights as provided in the preceding clause (a) and, in addition, the following special voting rights:
     (i) Election of Directors. Whenever dividends payable on any series of the Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends on the shares of all of the Preferred Stock of that series then outstanding, the holders of Preferred Stock of that series shall have the exclusive and special right voting separately as a class, to elect two directors of the corporation, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased to the extent necessary to effectuate such right. Whenever such right of the Board of Directors shall be increased to the extent necessary to effectuate such right. Whenever such right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall have vested, such right may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided in clause (b) (ii), or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders. The right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class to elect members of the Board of Directors of the corporation as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such series of the Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time the special right of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock so to vote separately as a class for the election of directors shall terminate, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default in an aggregate amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends.
     (ii) Special Meetings of Holders of Preferred Stock. At any time when such special voting power shall have vested in the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock as hereinbefore provided in clause (b) (i), a proper officer of the corporation shall, upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 10% of such series of the Preferred Stock then outstanding addressed to the Secretary of the corporation, call a special meeting of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock for the purpose of electing directors pursuant to clause (b) (i). Such meeting
 
shall be held at the earliest practicable date in such place as may be designated pursuant to the By-laws (or if there be no designation, at the principal offices of the corporation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin). If such meeting shall not be called by the proper officers of the corporation within 20 days after personal service of the said written request upon the Secretary of the corporation, or within 30 days after mailing the same within the United States of America by registered or certified mail addressed to the Secretary of the corporation at its principal office, then the holders of record of at least 10% of such series of the Preferred Stock then outstanding may designate in writing one of their numbers to call such meeting at the expense of the corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated upon the notice required for annual meetings of shareholders and shall be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Any holder of such series of Preferred Stock so designated shall have access to the stock books of the corporation for the purpose of causing meeting of shareholders to be called pursuant to these provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this clause (b) (ii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 90 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of shareholders.
     (iii) Special Rules Applicable While Any Series of Preferred Stock Has Special Voting Rights. At any annual or special meeting at which the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall have the special right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors as provided in clause (b) (i), the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of 33-1/3% of such series of the Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such series for the election of any director by the holders of such series as a class. At any such meeting or adjournment thereof, (A) the absence of a quorum of such series of the Preferred Stock shall not prevent the election of directors other than those to be elected by such series of the Preferred Stock voting as a class, and the absence of a quorum for the election of such other directors shall not prevent the election of the directors to be elected by such series of the Preferred Stock voting as a class and (B) in the absence of either or both such quorums, a majority of the holders present in person or by proxy of the stock or stocks which lack a quorum shall have power to adjourn the meeting for the election of directors which they are entitled to elect from time to time until a quorum shall be present, without notice other than announcement at the meeting.
     During any period in which the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock have the right to vote as a class for directors as provided in clause (b) (i), any vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be filled only be vote of a majority (even if that be only a single director) of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the series or class of stock which elected the directors whose office shall have become vacant. During such period the directors so elected by the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall continue in office (A) until the next succeeding annual meeting or until their successors, if any are elected by such holders and qualify, or (B) unless required by applicable law to continue in office for longer period, until termination of the right of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock to vote as a class for directors, if earlier. If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately upon any termination of the right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock to vote as a class for directors as provided in clause (b) (i), the term of office of the directors then in office so elected by the holders of such series shall terminate.
     (iv) Action Requiring Approval of Two-Thirds of Outstanding Shares of Each Series of Preferred Stock. The affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of record of at least tow-thirds of the outstanding shares of a series of the Preferred Stock shall be a prerequisite of the right of the corporation.
     (A) To create any shares of any securities convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase shares ranking prior to such series of the Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up; or
     (B) To change the designations, preferences, limitations, or relative rights of the outstanding shares or such series of Preferred Stock in any manner prejudicial to the holders thereof.
          (v) Action Requiring Approval of a Majority of Outstanding Shares of Each Series of Preferred Stock. The affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall be a prerequisite to the right of the corporation to authorize any shares of Preferred Stock in excess of 2,000,000 shares or any other shares ranking on a parity with Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
     (8) Restrictions in Event of Default in Dividends on Preferred Stock
     If at any time the corporation shall have failed to pay dividends in full on the Preferred Stock, thereafter and until dividends in full, including all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past quarterly dividend periods on the Preferred Stock outstanding, shall have been declared and set apart in trust for payment or paid, or if at any time the
 
corporation shall have failed to pay in full amounts payable with respect to any obligations to retire shares of the Preferred Stock, thereafter and until such amount shall have been paid in full or set apart in trust for payment (a) the corporation, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the Preferred Stock at the time outstanding given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a special meeting called for the purpose, at which the holders of the Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a class, regardless of series, shall not redeem less than all of the Preferred Stock at such time outstanding; (b) the corporation shall not purchase any Preferred Stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing to all holders of Preferred Stock of all series upon such terms as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion after consideration of the respective annual dividend rate and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series, shall determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive) will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series; provided that (i) the corporation, to meet the requirements of any purchase retirement or sinking fund provisions with respect to any series, may use shares of such series acquired by it prior to such failure and then held by it as treasury stock and (ii) nothing shall prevent the corporation from completing the purchase or redemption of shares of Preferred Stock for which a purchase contract was entered into for any purchase, retirement or sinking fund purposes, or the notice of redemption of which was initially mailed, prior to such failure; and (c) the corporation shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or permit any subsidiary to purchase or acquire any shares of any other stock of the corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation.
     (9) Series B, $2.00 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.
     (a) Designation  Series B. There shall be a series of the Preferred Stock of this corporation hereby designated as Series B, $2.00 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (hereinafter in this Paragraph (9) referred to as "Series B Stock") consisting of 1,000,000 shares. The shares of Series B Stock shall have the rights and preferences hereinafter set forth, in addition to those otherwise provided with respect to all shares of Preferred Stock.
     (b) Dividends  Series B. The rate of dividends on the Series B Stock shall be $2.00 pre annum, payable quarterly on the last days of March, June, September and December of each year for the respective Dividend Periods ending on such dates. Dividends on shares of Series B Stock shall accrue from and after October 1, 1978 and shall be cumulative from and after such date whether or not on nay quarterly dividend date there shall be funds legally available for the payment of dividends.
          (c) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up  Series B. In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of Series B Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation in money's worth an amount equal to $40.00 for each share of the Series B Stock, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, and no more, before any of such assets shall be paid or distributed to holders of Common Stock.

     (C) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in the preceding Sections (A) and (B) of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

Such determination shall be made:
     (1) By the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding.
     (2) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion;
     (3) By the shareholders; or
     (4) *By the chief legal officer of the corporation only in the following circumstances
     (a) the indemnified is a non-officer, non-director employee of the corporation, and

     (E) Expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in Section (D) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.
     (F) The right to indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     (G) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.
These Restated Articles of Incorporation supersede and take the place of the existing Articles of Incorporation and all amendments to the Articles of Incorporation through July 25, 2007.
