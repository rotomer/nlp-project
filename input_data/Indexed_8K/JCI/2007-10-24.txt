     "We are pleased to deliver record results for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year," said Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Roell. "We expect to continue to win share and grow at a faster pace than our underlying industries through our innovation, cost advantages and world-class quality."
 
     He continued, "It is a core part of our company's culture to understand customers' emerging needs and to deliver unique, practical solutions. Our employees around the world continue to show an outstanding commitment to our customers, and I thank them for another record year."
Fourth Quarter Results
     Building efficiency sales were $3.6 billion, up 15% compared with 2006 revenues of $3.1 billion. The increase reflects strong commercial buildings markets globally and higher demand for the company's solutions to improve energy efficiency and lower operating costs in non-residential buildings. Segment income increased 23% to $316 million from $257 million as a result of the higher revenues as well as cost structure improvements associated with the company's branch office network and manufacturing operations. The backlog of uncompleted commercial systems and services contracts at September 30, 2007 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year amount, reflecting continued market share gains.
     Automotive experience sales in the quarter were $4.2 billion, 3% higher than $4.0 billion in 2006. North American sales increased 2% and European sales rose 5%, approximately in line with overall vehicle production levels. Sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 3% due to lower volumes in Japan. Unconsolidated sales in China increased 48%. Segment income was $183 million, up 24% from $148 million last year as a result of a substantial improvement in North American profitability and a continued strong performance in Europe.
     Power solutions sales increased 27%, to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion last year due to higher unit prices resulting from the pass-through of increased lead costs, as well as slightly higher unit shipments. Segment income increased to $161 million, up 7% from $150 million in the 2006 fourth quarter due to the higher volume and improved operational efficiencies.
     The company said its net debt to total capitalization at September 30, 2007 was 30%, versus 35% at June 30, 2007.
 
2008 Outlook
     On October 9, 2007, the company issued guidance on its expected financial performance in 2008. Johnson Controls anticipates a sales increase of 10%, to approximately $38 billion. Income from continuing operations is estimated to increase approximately 18%, to $2.45  $2.50 per diluted share. The company said the strong performance will be the result of its participation in growth markets, its exposure to non-cyclical sectors, its global capabilities and technology leadership as well as its cost discipline.
     For the first quarter of 2008, the company expects diluted earnings per share to increase 25% - - 32% versus the 2007 first quarter, to a range of $0.35 to $0.37.

Power solutions
Beginning in fiscal year 2007, Company management, including the chief operating decision maker, adjusted their measurement of business unit performance, changing from operating income to segment income, which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests excluding restructuring charges and net financing charges. The primary reason for the modification was to reflect equity income in earnings for each business operation given its growing significance to the Company's global business strategies.
2. Acquisitions
In December 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of York International Corporation. The Company paid $56.50 for each outstanding share of common stock. The total cost of the acquisition, excluding cash acquired, was approximately $3.1 billion, including approximately $563 million of debt.
3. Discontinued Operations
In the second quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company recorded losses of approximately $48 million ($30 million after-tax) and $5 million ($3 million after-tax), respectively, related to the sale of businesses reported as discontinued operations, primarily Bristol Compressors.
4. Income Taxes
In the second quarter and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2007, the Company reduced its income tax liability by $15 million and $13 million, respectively, due to the favorable resolution of certain tax audits. The Company's federal income tax returns and certain foreign income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the Internal Revenue Service and respective foreign tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At September 30, 2007, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of financial position. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities, may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, the tax provision decreased as a result of a $22 million tax benefit realized by a change in tax status of an automotive experience subsidiary in the Netherlands. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the tax provision decreased as a result of an $11 million tax benefit realized by a change in tax status of an automotive experience subsidiary in Hungary and a building efficiency subsidiary in the Netherlands.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the tax provision increased $20 million as a result of a change in the German federal income tax rate.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the tax provision decreased $7 million due to a nonrecurring tax benefit related to the use of a valuation allowance with a joint venture.

4. Income Taxes (continued)
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded a $10 million tax benefit related to a favorable tax audit resolution in a foreign jurisdiction.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the tax provision decreased due to a $4 million nonrecurring tax benefit related to a $9 million gain from the disposition of the Company's interest in a German joint venture.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company completed an analysis of its German operations and, based on cumulative income over a 36-month period, an assessment of expected future profitability in Germany and finalization of the 2006 Plan, determined that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits of certain operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in Germany would be utilized in the future. As such, the Company reversed $131 million attributable to these operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the quarter ended June 30, 2006 as a credit to income tax expense, net of remaining valuation allowances at certain German subsidiaries and tax reserve requirements.
Based on the Company's cumulative operating results through the six months ended March 31, 2006 and an assessment of expected future profitability in Mexico, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits of its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in Mexico would be utilized in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company completed a tax reorganization in Mexico which will allow operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to be offset against the future taxable income of the reorganized entities. As such, in the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the Company reversed the entire valuation allowance of $32 million attributable to these operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as a credit to income tax expense.
In October 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign operations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. During the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the Company completed its evaluation of its repatriation plans and approximately $674 million of foreign earnings were designated for repatriation to the U.S. pursuant to the provisions of the AJCA. The increase in income tax liability related to the Company's AJCA initiatives totaled $42 million. The Company recorded $31 million of net income tax expense in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 as $11 million had been previously recorded by York prior to the acquisition in accordance with York's approved repatriation plan.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded a $19 million discrete period tax benefit related to third quarter 2006 restructuring costs using a blended statutory tax rate of 30.6%.
The tables below show a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):
5. New Accounting Standards
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. In September 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, including the measurement of the funded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as of the fiscal year-end date. The following table summarizes the initial adoption of SFAS No. 158 (in millions):
6. Stock Split
On July 25, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors declared a three-for-one split of the Company's common stock payable October 2, 2007 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2007. All share and per share amounts disclosed in this document have been restated to reflect the three-for-one stock split. The stock split resulted in the issuance of approximately 396 million additional shares of common stock. In connection with the stock split, the par value of the common stock was changed from $.04 1/6 per share to $.01 7/18 per share.
