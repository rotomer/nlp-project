Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) On November 14, 2007, the Board of Directors of Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") accepted Mr. Paul A. Brunners notice of retirement from the Board of Directors. Mr. Brunners retirement will be effective December 31, 2007 and is in accordance with the Companys mandatory Director Retirement Policy detailed in the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board of Directors has not at this time taken formal action to nominate a candidate to serve as a twelfth director after Mr. Brunner's retirement, but the Corporate Governance Committee is in the process of identifying and qualifying an appropriate candidate. Because that process is not complete, the Board of Directors also took action at the November 14, 2007 meeting to reduce the size of the Board from 12 to 11 members effective upon Mr. Brunners retirement, which the Company expects to be a temporary change. This action did not require an amendment to the Companys By-laws because the By-l aws provide for a range in the size of the Board of not less than ten nor more than thirteen members, with the Board to determine the size of the Board within this range by resolution.
