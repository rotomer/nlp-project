Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(d) On January 23, 2008, the Board of Directors of Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") elected Mr. Richard Goodman to serve as director of the Company as a member of the class of directors whose terms expire at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. Mr. Goodmans election to the Board of Directors was effective immediately. In addition, Mr. Goodman was appointed to the Companys Audit and Finance Committees. The Board of Directors has made a determination that Mr. Goodman is independent pursuant to the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange as well as the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines, and has also designated Mr. Goodman as an audit committee financial expert. Mr. Goodman is not party to any related person transactions with the Company as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Mr. Goodman is the Chief Financial Officer of PepsiCo Inc., and has served in that capacity since October 2006. The Companys Non-Employee Director Compensation Pol icy is applicable to Mr. Goodman. In connection with Mr. Goodmans election to the Board, he will receive on January 28, 2008 a pro rata portion of the current $25,000 quarterly cash retainer that the Company pays to its non-employee directors as well as the pro rata portion of the annual $100,000 retainer that is paid in shares of the Companys common stock. Additionally, Mr. Goodman will receive on February 1, 2008 a grant of 2,400 shares of the Companys common stock. All equity awards are made under the Companys 2003 Stock Plan for Outside Directors, as amended and restated as of October 1, 2006. The Board of Directors also took action at the January 23, 2008 meeting to increase the size of the Board from 11 to 12 members effective upon Mr. Goodmans election. This action did not require an amendment to the Companys By-laws because the By-laws provide for a range in the size of the Board of not less than ten nor more than thirteen members, with the B oard being required to determine the size of the Board within this range by resolution.
