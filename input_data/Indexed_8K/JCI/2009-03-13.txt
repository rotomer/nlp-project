Offering of Equity Units
     On March 10, 2009, Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Equity Units Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Equity Units Underwriters"), with respect to a registered public offering (the "Equity Units Offering") of 8,000,000 equity units (the "Equity Units") for an aggregate stated amount of $400,000,000. The Equity Units Offering is expected to close on March 16, 2009. Pursuant to the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement, the Equity Units Underwriters have a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 Equity Units, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
     Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and will initially consist of (i) a forward purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from the Company for a price in cash of $50, on the purchase contract settlement date of March 31, 2012, subject to early settlement in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as hereinafter defined), a certain number (the "Settlement Rate") of shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 7/18 par value (the "Common Stock"); and (ii) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 11.50% subordinated notes due 2042 (the "Subordinated Notes"). The Settlement Rate will be calculated as follows:
- If the applicable market value (as defined below) of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $10.29 (the "threshold appreciation price"), then the Settlement Rate will be 4.8579 shares of Common Stock;
- If the applicable market value of the Common Stock is less than the threshold appreciation price but greater than $8.95 (the "reference price"), then the Settlement Rate will be a number of shares of Common Stock equal to $50 divided by the applicable market value; and
- If the applicable market value of the Common Stock is less than or equal to the reference price, then the Settlement Rate will be 5.5866 shares of Common Stock.
The "applicable market value" of the Common Stock means the average of the closing price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the purchase contract settlement date. The reference price represents the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 10, 2009. The threshold appreciation price represents a premium of 15% over the reference price. The reference price, threshold appreciation price and settlement rate are subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
     The Equity Units Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
     The Subordinated Notes are being issued pursuant to a Subordinated Indenture, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Subordinated Indenture Trustee"), to be dated March 16, 2009, as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, between the Company and the Subordinated Indenture Trustee, to be dated March 16, 2009 (collectively, the "Subordinated Indenture"). The Equity Units are being issued pursuant to a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, to be dated March 16, 2009 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary.
     The Subordinated Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Subordinated Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subordinated Notes may declare the Subordinated Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company, all outstanding Subordinated Notes under the Indenture will become due and payable immediately.
     Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Subordinated Notes are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligations to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the purchase contracts. The Company will attempt to remarket the Subordinated Notes prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and a remarketing agreement, a form of which is attached as an exhibit to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Equity Units are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157502) (the "Registration Statement") that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act on February 23, 2009. The Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with its filing with the SEC of a definitive prospectus supplement, dated March 10, 2009, and prospectus, dated February 23, 2009, relating to the Equity Units Offering. See "Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits."
Offering of Convertible Notes
     On March 10, 2009, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Convertible Notes Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Convertible Notes Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to and upon terms and conditions set forth therein, $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2012 (the "Convertible Notes") in a registered public offering (the "Convertible Notes Offering"). The Convertible Notes Offering is expected to close on March 16, 2009. Pursuant to the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement, the Convertible Notes Underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $52,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
     The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will initially be 89.3855 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.19 per share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment in certain events. Holders may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of September 30, 2012. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver a number of shares equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted divided by $1,000, multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate.
     The Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
     The Convertible Notes will be issued under the Senior Indenture (the "Senior Indenture"), dated January 17, 2006, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor Trustee (the "Senior Indenture Trustee"), as amended and supplemented, including by Supplemental Indenture No. 2, between the Company and the Senior Indenture Trustee, to be dated March 16, 2009 (collectively, the "Senior Indenture"). The Senior Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Senior Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare the Convertible Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the company or any of its significant subsidiaries, all outstanding Convertible Notes under the Indenture will become due and payable immediately.
     The Convertible Notes have been registered under the Securities Act on the Registration Statement. The Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with its filing with the SEC of a definitive prospectus supplement, dated March 10, 2009, and prospectus, dated February 23, 2009, relating to the Convertible Notes Offering. See "Item 9.01 - Financial Statements and Exhibits."

     In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Equity Units Underwriters, the Convertible Notes Underwriters or their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary business with the Company. In addition, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. was the sole lead arranger and book-runner for the Company's revolving credit facility, and affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc. were co-syndication agents for the Company's revolving credit facility, for which they each received customary compensation.

Exhibit 1.1
Execution Version
March 10, 2009 New York, New York
To the Representatives
named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representatives, with respect to: (1) the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective number of 8,000,000 Equity Units of the Company (the "Initial Securities") set forth opposite their names in Schedule II, and (2) the grant by the Company to the Underwriters of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof, all or any part of an additional 1,200,000 Equity Units (the "Option Securities"), solely to cover over-allotments. The Initial Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters, all or any part of the Option Securities and the Component Securities (as defined below) that comprise the Initial Securities and the Option Securities are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities." Each Security has a stated amount of $50 (the "Stated Amount") and initially consists of (1) a stock purchase contract (each, a "Stock Purchase Contract") under which the holder will agree to purchase, and the Company will agree to sell, on March 31, 2012 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to early settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), to be dated as of the Firm Closing Date (as defined herein), among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary, and U.S. Bank National Association, as stock purchase contract agent (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), for a price equal to the Stated Amount per Security, a number of shares of common stock (the "Issuable Common Stock") of the Company, $0.01 7/18 par value (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and (2) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 11.50% subordinated notes due 2042 (the "Notes").
     The Notes are to be issued pursuant to a subordinated indenture dated as of the Firm Closing Date, as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of the Firm Closing Date (as amended and supplemented, the "Subordinated Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 19 hereof.
 
     A holder's ownership interest in the Notes initially will be pledged to secure such holder's obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such pledge to be on the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Stock Purchase Contracts will be issued pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Stock Purchase Contracts together with the related Notes (or, upon the occurrence of a successful remarketing of the Notes prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Treasury portfolio) are herein referred to as the "Corporate Units."
     A holder of Corporate Units, at its option, may elect to create "Treasury Units" by substituting pledged U.S. treasury securities for any pledged ownership interests in the Notes. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "Equity Units" includes both Corporate Units and Treasury Units.
     Pursuant to a remarketing agreement, the form of which is attached to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") to be entered into among the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms to be selected by the Company, as reset agent(s) and remarketing agent(s), the Notes may be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Remarketing Agreement.
     The "Component Securities" means, collectively, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Notes and the Issuable Common Stock.
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities (including the Component Securities) shall be as specified in (i) the Subordinated Indenture or (ii) the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (each document listed in clauses (i) through (ii), together with the Remarketing Agreement, each, a "Securities Agreement" and collectively, the "Securities Agreements").
     Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

     (b) In addition, in reliance upon the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, the Option Securities. The option hereby granted will be solely to cover over-allotments, will expire 13 days after the Firm Closing Date and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time upon notice (each, an "Option Exercise Notice") by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities (each, an "Option Closing Date"). The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter on an Option Closing Date shall be the same percentage of the total number of the Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Initial Securities. Any Option Closing Date shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than
 
five full business days after the date of the Option Exercise Notice unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties hereto, nor in any event prior to the Firm Closing Date (as defined below).
     3. . Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto or the Option Exercise Notice, as applicable, or such later date not later than five business days after such specified date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities specified in Schedule I being herein called the "Firm Closing Date" and, together with any Option Closing Date, each a "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
Delivery and Payment
     4. . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements of the Company
          (a) During the period beginning with the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the relevant Closing Date or such date as, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Final Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with the initial offering or sale of the Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless, in each case, the Company has furnished the Representatives a copy for their review prior to such time, and the Company will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filings.
          (b) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rules 424(b) and 433, respectively, (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof, including, if necessary, and subject to the first sentence
 
of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
          (c) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, as set forth in Schedule IV hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
          (d) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event occurs as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of such event or, in circumstances where the Company's obligations under this paragraph (d) arise from an opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, notify the Representatives of such event after the Company receives such opinion, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment to the Registration Statement, a new registration statement or an amendment or supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representatives in such quantities as may be reasonably requested.
          (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the date hereof and otherwise satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158).
          (f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          (g) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities (provided that the Company will not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now subject), will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors and will pay
 
the fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in connection with its review of the offering.
          (h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for printing and engraving fees, for fees charged by the Trustee, the collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, for the fees incurred by the Underwriters in road shows, for the filing fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority relating to the Securities and for expenses incurred in printing and distributing the Final Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectuses and any supplements thereto to the Underwriters. The Company will pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
          (i) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, prepare, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus where, as a result of such preparation, use, authorization, approval or reference, the Company would be required to file the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission or retain the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus under Rule 433 and the Company will not file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission (other than the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto, any electronic road show and any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package). Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (ii) it will comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
          (j) Until the business date set forth on Schedule I hereto, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Notes and the Company's 6.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 that are being offered concurrently with the Securities).
          (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
          (l) The Company will retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433.
 
          (m) The Company will file a listing application and all required supporting documents with respect to the Corporate Units and the Issuable Common Stock with the New York Stock Exchange and take further actions as are necessary to arrange for the listing of the Corporate Units and the Issuable Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as is reasonably practicable.
          (n) The Company will file a registration statement on Form 8-A with the Commission to register the Corporate Units under the Exchange Act as promptly as is practicable and shall use its best efforts to have such registration statement become effective as promptly as is reasonably practicable.
          (o) The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and will not use any such proceeds to repurchase shares of Common Stock.
          (p) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 4(j) hereof, during a period of 90 days after the date hereof, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any share of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock or file any registration statement under the Act with respect to any of the foregoing or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A) the Securities to be sold hereunder, (B) any securities to be sold in the Company's concurrent offering of convertible senior notes, (C) any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon the exercise of an option or warrant or the conversion of a security in each such case outstanding on the date hereof and referred to in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or granted in accordance with clause (D) of this Section 4(p), (D) any shares of Common Stock issued, or options to purchase Common Stock granted, pursuant to existing employee benefit plans of the Company, and (E) any shares of Common Stock contributed by the Company to its 401(k) plans in effect on the date hereof, provided that the aggregate value of any such contributions, determined based on the closing price of the Common Stock the trading day immediately preceding the date of any such contributions, shall be consistent with the Company's prior contributions to such plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) during the last 17 days of the 90-day restricted period, the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day restricted period, the restrictions imposed by this Section 4(p) shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news or the occurrence of the material event, unless the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, waive such extension in writing.
 
          (q) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue shares of its Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contracts.
          (r) On or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period (as defined in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), the Company shall have entered into, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Stock Purchase Contract Agent enter into, the Remarketing Agreement.
     5. . Each Underwriter agrees with the Company that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any Free Writing Prospectus (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III, any electronic road show or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus prepared pursuant to Section 4(i) above or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Schedule IV hereto without the consent of the Company.

     (iii) assuming the Securities (other than the Notes) have been duly authorized and executed by the Company, when executed on behalf of the holders thereof by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and delivered to and paid for in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Securities Agreements, the Securities (other than the Notes) will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect);

     (v) assuming that the Stock Purchase Contract Agent has been duly appointed as the attorney-in-fact of each holder, then the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement creates a valid security interest in favor of U.S. Bank National
 
Association, as collateral agent for the benefit of the Company in that portion of the Collateral (as defined in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement) in which the holder has rights and a valid security interest may be created under Article 9 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, which security interest secures the Obligations (as defined in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement).
     In addition, such counsel shall state that it has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that (i) at the Effective Date immediately preceding the Execution Time the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except in each case for financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need not make any statement).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
          (d) The Representatives shall have received from Mayer Brown LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion and 10b-5 statement, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Securities Agreements, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, solely in their respective capacities as such, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any amendments or supplements thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there has been no Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
          (f) At the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the
 
minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the board of directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus;
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any "capsule" information), audited or unaudited, in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, at a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of the letter, there were any changes in capital stock or increase in long-term debt as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding quarter in net revenues or in the total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur or it shall state any specific changes or decreases and the amount thereof; or
     (3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial
 
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined whether or not certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 1A, 2, 6, 7, 7A and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
          References to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any amendments or supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
          In addition, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, at the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth above.
          (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there shall not have been (i) any change specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the effect of which in any case referred to in paragraph (g)(i) or (ii) of this Section 6, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or
 
have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
          (h) Subsequent to the earlier of the Initial Sale Time and the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purpose of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
          (i) The Corporate Units and the Issuable Common Stock shall have been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution, and reasonably satisfactory evidence of such actions shall have been provided to the Representatives.
          (j) On the date of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto signed by the persons listed on Schedule V hereto.
          (k) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
     7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
Indemnification and Contribution
 
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, the dollar amounts in the fourth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" relating to concessions and reallowances and in the fourteenth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the
provided
however
 
indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged
provided
however
 
untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). For the avoidance of doubt, the contribution obligations of the Underwriters under this paragraph (d) are several and not joint.
     9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

     10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred (1) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, act of terrorism, attack on the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or (2) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, and, with respect to either (1) or (2) above, the effect of

     11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

     14. .

Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.

c/o J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 277 Park Avenue New York, NY 10172
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned understands that you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with the Company, providing for the public offering (the "Public Offering") by the several Underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), of 8,000,000 Equity Units of the Company and an additional 1,200,000 Equity Units solely to cover over-allotments (together, the "Securities").

owned by the undersigned in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities which may be issued upon exercise of a stock option or warrant) or (2) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise or (3) make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock without the prior written consent of the Representatives, in each case other than (A) transfers of shares of Common Stock as a bona fide gift or gifts and (B) transfers of shares of Common Stock to the undersigned's family or to a trust, the beneficiaries of which are exclusively the undersigned or members of the undersigned's family; that in the case of any transfer or distribution pursuant to clause (A) or (B), each donee, distributee or transferee shall execute and deliver to the Representatives a lock-up letter in the form of this paragraph; and , , that in the case of any transfer or distribution pursuant to clause (A) or (B), no filing by any party (donor, donee, transferor or transferee) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other public announcement shall be required or shall be made voluntarily in connection with such transfer or distribution (other than a filing on a Form 5 made after the expiration of the 90-day restricted period referred to above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) during the last 17 days of the 90-day restricted period, the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day restricted period, the restrictions imposed by this Letter Agreement shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news or the occurrence of the material event, unless J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, on behalf of the Underwriters, waive such extension in writing.

Exhibit 1.2
Execution Version
March 10, 2009 New York, New York
To the Representatives  named in Schedule I hereto  of the Underwriters named in  Schedule II hereto

Representations and Warranties
          (a) The Company meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and has filed the Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" (as defined in Rule 405), and the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto filed prior to the Execution Time became effective upon filing. The Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the Execution Time and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) has been received by the Company. The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more Preliminary Final Prospectuses, each of which has previously been furnished to the Representatives. The Company will file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) a final supplement to the form of prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall include all information required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included therein with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to the Representatives prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised the Representatives, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Execution Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x).
          (b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed (if required) in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on each Closing Date (as defined herein), the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the respective rules and regulations thereunder; on the Effective Date and at the Execution Time, the Registration Statement did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the Effective Date and on each Closing Date, the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule
 
424(b), and on each Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representation or warranty as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
          (c) As of the Initial Sale Time, the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented as of the Initial Sale Time, and each electronic road show when taken together as a whole with the Disclosure Package, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and no Issuer Free Writing Prospectus includes any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified; provided, however, that the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Disclosure Package in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
          (d) The Company (including its agents and representatives, other than the Underwriters in their respective capacities as such) has not made, used, prepared, authorized, approved or referred to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that it was required to file with the Commission or retain under Rule 433 other than the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto.

          (p) None of the execution by the Company of this Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Securities or the performance by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any law or the charter or by-laws of the Company or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or bound or any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Agreements of the Company
          (a) During the period beginning with the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the relevant Closing Date or such date as, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Final Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with the initial offering or sale of the Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless, in each case, the Company has furnished the Representatives a copy for their review prior to such time, and the Company will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filings.
          (b) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rules 424(b) and 433, respectively, (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof, including, if necessary, and subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.

          (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the date hereof and otherwise satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158).
          (f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          (g) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities (provided that the Company will not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now subject), will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors and will pay the fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in connection with its review of the offering.
          (h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses
 
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for printing and engraving fees, for fees charged by the Trustee, for the fees incurred by the Underwriters in road shows, for the fees incurred in connection with the listing of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, for the filing fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority relating to the Securities and for expenses incurred in printing and distributing the Final Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectuses and any supplements thereto to the Underwriters. The Company will pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
          (i) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, prepare, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus where, as a result of such preparation, use, authorization, approval or reference, the Company would be required to file the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission or retain the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus under Rule 433 and the Company will not file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission (other than the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto, any electronic road show and any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package). Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (ii) it will comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
          (j) Until the business date set forth on Schedule I hereto, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities and the Company's equity units that are being offered concurrently with the Securities).
          (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

          (m) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the listing of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
          (n) The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and will not use any such proceeds to repurchase shares of Common Stock.
          (o) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 4(j) hereof, during a period of 90 days after the date hereof, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any share of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock or file any registration statement under the Act with respect to any of the foregoing or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) during the last 17 days of the 90-day restricted period, the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day restricted period, the restrictions imposed by this Section 4(o) shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news or the occurrence of the material event, unless J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, on behalf of the Underwriters, waive such extension in writing.
          (p) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue shares of its Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities.
          (q) Between the Execution Time and the Closing Date, the Company will not do or authorize any act or thing that would result in an adjustment of the conversion rate of the Securities.
     5. . Each Underwriter agrees with the Company that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any Free Writing Prospectus (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the
Agreements of the Underwriters
 
Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III, any electronic road show or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus prepared pursuant to Section 4(i) above or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Schedule IV hereto without the consent of the Company.
     6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the relevant Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (vi) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (vii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the performance by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein, except (A) such as have been obtained under the Act or (B) such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any United States jurisdiction or the securities laws of any foreign jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained;
     (viii) none of the execution by the Company of this Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Securities or the performance by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement will result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, (A) any law of the United States of America or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law; (B) the articles of incorporation or by-laws
 
of the Company; (C) the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound; or (D) any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of (C) for any such breach, violation or default that could not adversely affect in a material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or would otherwise be material in the context of the sale of the Securities;
     (ix) the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and was filed with the Commission not earlier than the date three years before the Execution Time; any required filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made within the time period required by Rule 424(b); any required filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus of which such counsel has knowledge has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the Form T-1 and the financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder; and

     In addition, such counsel shall state that he has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such
 
counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that (i) at the Effective Date immediately preceding the Execution Time the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except in each case for financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need not make any statement).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
          (c) The Representatives shall have received the opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company and the Trustee, constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect);
     (ii) assuming the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered by the Company, the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect); and
     (iii) to the extent that they constitute matters of law, summaries of legal matters or legal conclusions, the statements set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of notes," and "Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations" are accurate in all material respects and fairly present the information provided.
 
     In addition, such counsel shall state that it has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that (i) at the Effective Date immediately preceding the Execution Time the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except in each case for financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need not make any statement).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
          (d) The Representatives shall have received from Mayer Brown LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion and 10b-5 statement, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, solely in their respective capacities as such, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any amendments or
 
supplements thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there has been no Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
          (f) At the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the board of directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or
 
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus;
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any "capsule" information), audited or unaudited, in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, at a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of the letter, there were any changes in capital stock or increase in long-term debt as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding quarter in net revenues or in the total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur or it shall state any specific changes or decreases and the amount thereof; or
     (3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined whether or not certain information of an accounting,
 
financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 1A, 2, 6, 7, 7A and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
          References to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any amendments or supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
          In addition, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, at the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth above.
          (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there shall not have been (i) any change specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the effect of which in any case referred to in paragraph (g)(i) or (ii) of this Section 6, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
 
          (h) Subsequent to the earlier of the Initial Sale Time and the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purpose of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
          (i) On the date of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto signed by the persons listed on Schedule V hereto.
          (j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
     7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, the percentage in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingCommissions and discounts" relating to concessions and in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingPrice stabilization and short positions" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
provided
however
 
parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the
provided
however
 
Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). For the avoidance of doubt, the contribution obligations of the Underwriters under this paragraph (d) are several and not joint.
     9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Exhibit 5.1
Johnson Controls, Inc. 5757 North Green Bay Avenue Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as counsel for Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157502) (the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated February 23, 2009, and the final supplement to the prospectus, dated March 10, 2009 (collectively, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of (a) 8,000,000 equity units and (b) up to 1,200,000 additional equity units pursuant to the over-allotment option granted by the Company to the underwriters (the equity units described in clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to as the "Equity Units"). Each Equity Unit has an initial stated amount of $50 and initially consists of (i) a purchase contract (the "Purchase Contract"), with a settlement date of March 31, 2012, obligating the holder to purchase shares of common stock, $.01 7/18 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock"), and (ii) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 11.50% subordinated notes due 2042 (the "Subordinated Notes"). The Purchase Contracts will be issued under the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement to be dated March 16, 2009 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary (the "Collateral Agent"); the Subordinated Notes will be issued under a Subordinated Indenture, to be dated March 16, 2009, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, to be dated March 16, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee (collectively, the "Indenture"), establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the Subordinated Notes; a minimum of 4.8579 shares of Common Stock and a maximum of 5.5866 shares of Common Stock (the "Shares") are initially issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts as set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
          As counsel to the Company in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of the Equity Units and the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the Purchase Contracts, we have examined or are otherwise familiar with (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company; (ii) the By-Laws of the Company, as amended to date; (iii) the Registration Statement, including the exhibits thereto; (iv) the Indenture; (v) the Purchase Contract and Pledge
 
Johnson Controls, Inc. March 13, 2009 Page 2
Agreement; (vi) the Remarketing Agreement; (vii) the corporate proceedings taken by the Board of Directors of the Company to authorize the filing of the Registration Statement and the issuance of these securities; and (viii) such other documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.
          In our examination of the above-referenced documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
          Based upon the foregoing, having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant and assuming that (i) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee; (ii) the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Purchase Contract Agent and Collateral Agent; (iii) the Equity Units have been duly authenticated by the Purchase Contract Agent and Collateral Agent; and (iv) the Equity Units and Purchase Contracts are valid and binding obligations of the holders thereof, we are of the opinion that:
          (1) The Subordinated Notes, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms.
          (2) The Purchase Contracts, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms.
          (3) The Equity Units, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms.
          (4) Upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts as set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
Johnson Controls, Inc. March 13, 2009 Page 3
          With respect to numbered paragraph (4) above, at one time Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law imposed personal liability upon shareholders for debts owing to employees of the Company for services performed, but not exceeding six months' service in any one case. This statutory provision was repealed by 2005 Wisconsin Act 474, which provided that the repeal applies to debts incurred on or after June 14, 2006.
          The opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that the enforceability of any contract or agreement or of any security or other instrument issued thereunder may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally and to court decisions with respect thereto and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          We are qualified to practice law in the States of Wisconsin and New York, and we do not purport to be an expert on the law other than that of the States of Wisconsin and New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of Wisconsin and New York and the federal laws of the United States.
          We hereby consent to the deemed incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and to the reference to our firm therein. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
