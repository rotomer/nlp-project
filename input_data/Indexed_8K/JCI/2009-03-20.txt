The undersigned hereby amends Items 1.01 and 9.01 of the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated March 10, 2009, to read in their entirety as set forth below:
Item 1.01. .
Entry into Material Definitive Agreement
Offering of Equity Units
     On March 10, 2009, Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Equity Units Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Equity Units Underwriters"), with respect to a registered public offering (the "Equity Units Offering") of 8,000,000 equity units (the "Equity Units") for an aggregate stated amount of $400,000,000. Pursuant to the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement, the Equity Units Underwriters had an option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 Equity Units, solely to cover over-allotments, if any, which the Equity Units Underwriters partially exercised. On March 16, 2009, the Equity Units Offering closed, resulting in a total sale of $450,000,000 aggregate stated amount of Equity Units.
     Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and initially consists of (i) a forward purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from the Company for a price in cash of $50, on the purchase contract settlement date of March 31, 2012, subject to early settlement in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as hereinafter defined), a certain number (the "Settlement Rate") of shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 7/18 par value (the "Common Stock"); and (ii) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 11.50% subordinated notes due 2042 (the "Subordinated Notes"). The Settlement Rate will be calculated as follows:
- If the applicable market value (as defined below) of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $10.29 (the "threshold appreciation price"), then the Settlement Rate will be 4.8579 shares of Common Stock;
- If the applicable market value of the Common Stock is less than the threshold appreciation price but greater than $8.95 (the "reference price"), then the Settlement Rate will be a number of shares of Common Stock equal to $50 divided by the applicable market value; and
- If the applicable market value of the Common Stock is less than or equal to the reference price, then the Settlement Rate will be 5.5866 shares of Common Stock.
The "applicable market value" of the Common Stock means the average of the closing price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the purchase contract settlement date. The reference price represents the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 10, 2009. The threshold appreciation price represents a premium of 15% over the reference price. The reference price, threshold appreciation price and settlement rate are subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
     The Equity Units Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and
 
obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
     The Subordinated Notes were issued pursuant to a Subordinated Indenture (the "Subordinated Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Subordinated Indenture Trustee"), dated March 16, 2009, as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Subordinated Indenture Trustee, dated March 16, 2009 (the Subordinated Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture are collectively referred to as the "Subordinated Indenture"). The Equity Units were issued pursuant to a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated March 16, 2009 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary.
     The Subordinated Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Subordinated Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subordinated Notes may declare the Subordinated Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company, all outstanding Subordinated Notes under the Subordinated Indenture will become due and payable immediately. The description of the Subordinated Indenture set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the Subordinated Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibits 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
     Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Subordinated Notes are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligations to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the purchase contracts. The Company will attempt to remarket the Subordinated Notes prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and a remarketing agreement, a form of which is attached as an exhibit to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The description of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
     The Equity Units have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157502) (the "Registration Statement") that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act on February 23, 2009. The Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with its filing with the SEC of a definitive prospectus supplement, dated March 10, 2009, and prospectus, dated February 23, 2009, relating to the Equity Units Offering. See "Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits."
 
Offering of Convertible Notes
     On March 10, 2009, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Convertible Notes Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Convertible Notes Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to and upon terms and conditions set forth therein, $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2012 (the "Convertible Notes") in a registered public offering (the "Convertible Notes Offering"). Pursuant to the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement, the Convertible Notes Underwriters had an option to purchase up to an additional $52,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any, which the Convertible Notes Underwriters fully exercised. On March 16, 2009, the Convertible Notes Offering closed, resulting in a total sale of $402,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
     The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will initially be 89.3855 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.19 per share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment in certain events. Holders may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of September 30, 2012. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver a number of shares equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted divided by $1,000, multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate.
     The Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Convertible Notes Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Convertible Notes were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated January 17, 2006, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor Trustee (the "Senior Indenture Trustee"), as amended and supplemented, including by the Supplemental Indenture, between the Company and the Senior Indenture Trustee, dated March 16, 2009 (collectively, the "Senior Indenture"). The Senior Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Senior Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare the Convertible Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries, all outstanding Convertible Notes under the Indenture will become due and payable immediately. The description of the Supplemental Indenture relating to the Convertible Notes set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
     The Convertible Notes have been registered under the Securities Act on the Registration Statement. The Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with its filing with the SEC of a definitive prospectus supplement, dated March 10, 2009, and prospectus, dated February 23, 2009, relating to the Convertible Notes Offering. See "Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits."
Underwriters
     In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Equity Units Underwriters, the Convertible Notes Underwriters or their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary business with the Company. In addition, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. was the sole lead arranger and book-runner for the Company's revolving credit facility, and affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc. were co-syndication agents for the Company's revolving credit facility, for which they each received customary compensation.

Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder of the Notes. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.

Adjustments Upon Certain Fundamental Changes
          (a) If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall, under certain circumstances, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below. A conversion of Notes shall be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" such Make-Whole Fundamental Change if the notice of conversion of the Notes is received by the Conversion Agent from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change up to, and including, the Business Day immediately prior to the related Fundamental Change Purchase Date (or, in the case of an event that would have been a Fundamental Change but for the proviso in of the definition thereof, the thirty-fifth (35) Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change). Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, if the consideration for the Common Stock in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in of the definition of Fundamental Change is comprised entirely of cash, for any conversion of Notes following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the conversion obligation will be calculated based solely on the Stock Price for the transaction and will be deemed to be an amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes equal to the applicable Conversion Rate (including any adjustment described in this ) by such

Effect of Recapitalization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
          If any of the following events occur:

     (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company;
     (iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety; or
     (iv) any statutory share exchange;
in each case of  as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof), then, at the effective time of such transaction, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that at and after the effective time of such transaction, the right to convert a Note will be changed into a right to convert it (on a net share settled basis) as set forth in this Supplemental Indenture into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction (by the principal amount of such Note divided by $1,000) would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") upon such transaction. If the transaction causes Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of shareholder election), the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible (on a net share settled basis) as set forth in this Supplemental Indenture shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with this . In connection with any such transaction, the Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted based on the number of shares of Common Stock comprising the Reference Property and, if applicable, the value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of any non-stock consideration comprising the Reference Property. If the Reference Property is comprised solely of non-stock consideration, the Initial Dividend Threshold will be zero. In addition, any such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this in the judgment of the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the successor Person.

          The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Notes maintained by the Debt Security registrar, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Notes converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

Reservation of Shares; Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance With Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock.
          The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to satisfy conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Notes would be converted by a single Holder). The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (subject to former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law) and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from any tax, lien or charge (other than those created by the Holder).

Responsibility of Trustee.
          The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Notes to determine or calculate the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this . Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash or any combination thereof) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 8.02 of the Original Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.

If, prior to any conversion, however, such rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of the Common Stock shares of the Company's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights or warrants as described in above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

Each agent of the Company appointed pursuant to Section 5.02 as a person authorized to register and register transfer of Debt Securities is sometimes herein referred to as a "Debt Security registrar."
Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Debt Securities
 
     The Company shall keep, at each such office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, as provided in Section 5.02, a register for each series of Debt Securities hereunder (the registers of all Debt Security registrars being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Debt Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Debt Securities and shall register the transfer of Debt Securities as in this Article Three provided. At all reasonable times, such Debt Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Debt Security registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Debt Security at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Debt Security by any Debt Security registrar in the registry books maintained by such Debt Security registrar, and delivery of such Debt Security, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Debt Security.
     The Company will at all times designate one Person (who may be the Company and who need not be a Debt Security registrar) to act as repository of a master list of names and addresses of Holders of the Debt Securities. The Trustee shall act as such repository unless and until some other Person is, by written notice from the Company to the Trustee and each Debt Security registrar, designated by the Company to act as such. The Company shall cause each Debt Security registrar to furnish to such repository, on a current basis, such information as such repository may reasonably request as to registrations, transfers, exchanges and other transactions effected by such registrar, as may be necessary or advisable to enable such repository to maintain such master list on as current a basis as is reasonably practicable.
     No Person shall at any time be appointed as or act as a Debt Security registrar unless such Person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such and duly registered to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
     All Debt Securities presented to a Debt Security registrar for registration of transfer shall be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and such Debt Security registrar duly executed by the registered Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
     The Company shall not be required to issue, exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Debt Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series so selected for redemption, or (b) any Debt Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Debt Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     All Debt Securities issued in exchange for or upon registration of transfer of Debt Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to
 
the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities surrendered for such exchange or registration of transfer.
     None of the Trustee, any agent of the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Company will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     SECTION 3.07. . In case any temporary or definitive Debt Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Debt Security, bearing a number, letter or other distinguishing mark not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Debt Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Debt Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Debt Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft, of such Debt Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Debt Securities
     In the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Company that such Debt Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Trustee shall authenticate any such substituted Debt Security and deliver the same upon any Company Request. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debt Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Debt Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Debt Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Debt Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and to the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Debt Security and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substituted Debt Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.07 by virtue of the fact that any Debt Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities duly issued hereunder. All Debt Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities and shall preclude (to the extent permitted by law) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     SECTION 3.08. . Interest which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, on any Debt
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
 
Security, shall unless otherwise provided in such Debt Security be paid to the Person in whose name the Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Unless otherwise stated in the form of Debt Security of a series, interest on the Debt Securities of any series shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months.
     Any interest on any Debt Security which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names any such Debt Securities (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Debt Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefore to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of such Debt Securities, at his address as it appears in the Debt Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefore having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Debt Securities of that series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if , after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debt Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.
 
     None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Debt Security registrar shall have any responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner in a global Debt Security or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depository or its nominee or of any agent member, with respect to any ownership interest in the Debt Securities or with respect to the delivery to any agent member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than the Depository) of any notice (including any notice of redemption) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Debt Securities. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders under the Debt Securities and this Indenture shall be given or made only to or upon the order of the registered holders (which shall be the Depository or its nominee in the case of the global Debt Security). The rights of beneficial owners in the global Debt Security shall be exercised only through the Depository subject to its applicable procedures. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Debt Security registrar shall be entitled to rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its members, participants and any beneficial owners. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Debt Security registrar shall be entitled to deal with the Depository, and any nominee thereof, that is the registered holder of any global Debt Security for all purposes of this Indenture relating to such global Debt Security (including the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and additional amounts, if any, and the giving of instructions or directions by or to the owner or holder of a beneficial ownership interest in such global Debt Security) as the sole holder of such global Debt Security and shall have no obligations to the beneficial owners thereof. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Debt Security registrar shall have any responsibility or liability for any acts or omissions of the Depository with respect to such global Debt Security, for the records of any such Depository, including records in respect of beneficial ownership interests in respect of any such global Debt Security, for any transactions between the Depository and any agent member or between or among the Depository, any such agent member and/or any holder or owner of a beneficial interest in such global Debt Security, or for any transfers of beneficial interests in any such global Debt Security.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global Debt Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such global Debt Security or shall impair, as between such Depository and owners of beneficial interests in such global Debt Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depository (or its nominee) as Holder of such global Debt Security.
     SECTION 3.09. . The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Debt Security is registered as the owner of such Debt Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 3.08) interest on, such Debt Security and for all other purposes whatsoever whether or not such Debt Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Persons Deemed Owners
     SECTION 3.10. . All Debt Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer or delivered in satisfaction in whole or in part of any sinking fund obligation shall, if surrendered to
Cancellation of Debt Securities Paid, etc
 
the Company or any agent of the Trustee or the Company under this Indenture, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, and no Debt Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Debt Securities in accordance with its customary procedures unless directed by a Company Order.
     SECTION 3.11. . (a) With respect to Debt Securities denominated in Dollars or a Foreign Currency, the following payment provisions shall apply:
Currency and Manner of Payments
     (1) Except as provided in subparagraph (a)(2) or in paragraph (c) of this Section 3.11, payment of principal of and premium, if any, on any Debt Securities will be made at the offices established pursuant to Section 5.02 by delivery of a check in the currency in which the Debt Security is denominated on the payment date against surrender of such Debt Security, and any interest on any Debt Security will be paid at such office by mailing a check in the currency in which the Debt Securities were issued to the Person entitled thereto at the address of such Person appearing on the Debt Security Register.
     (2) Payment of the principal of and premiums, if any, and interest on such Debt Security may also, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be made at such other place or places as may be designated by the Company by any appropriate method.
     (a) Not later than the fourth Business Day after the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, the Paying Agent will deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the currency in which each series of the Debt Securities are denominated, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Debt Securities to be made on such payment date, specifying the amounts so payable in respect of the Debt Securities. The failure of the Paying Agent to deliver such notice shall not relieve the Company from its obligation to make all payments with respect to any Debt Security when due.
     (b) If the Foreign Currency in which any of the Debt Securities are denominated ceases to be used both by the government of the country which issued such currency and for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then with respect to each date for the payment of Foreign Currency occurring after the last date on which the Foreign Currency was so used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the currency of payment for use on each such Interest Payment Date. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee and by the Trustee or any paying agent to the Holder of such Debt Securities with respect to such payment date shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency as determined by the Currency Determination Agent as of the Record Date (the "Valuation Date") in the manner provided in paragraph (d).
     (c) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent as of each Valuation Date and shall be obtained by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Valuation Date.
     (d) The "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean, for any currency, the highest firm bid quotation for U.S. dollars received by the Currency Determination Agent at approximately 11:00
 
a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date (or, if no such rate is quoted on such date, the last date on which such rate was quoted), from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in the City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be the Currency Determination) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of such currency payable on such payment in respect of all Notes denominated in such currency.
     All decisions and determinations of the Currency Determination Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency and the Market Exchange Rate shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company and all Holders of the Debt Securities. In the event that the Foreign Currency ceases to be used both by the government of the country which issued such currency and for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 15.03 to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date.
     The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying on and acting upon the information so received by it from the Company or the Currency Determination Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
     If the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any Debt Securities is payable in a Foreign Currency and such Foreign Currency is not available for payment due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, then the Company shall be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders under this Indenture by making such payment in Dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate for such Foreign Currency on the latest date for which such rate was established on or before the date on which payment is due. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 3.11 in Dollars where the required payment is in a Foreign Currency shall not constitute a default under this Indenture.
     SECTION 4.01. . The Company may reserve the right to redeem and pay before Stated Maturity all or any part of the Debt Securities of any series, either by optional redemption, sinking fund (mandatory or optional) or otherwise, by provision therefor in the form of Debt Security for such series on such terms as are specified in such form or the Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.01 or the indenture supplemental hereto as provided in Section 3.01 with respect to Debt Securities of such series. Redemption of Debt Securities of any series shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Debt Securities and, to the extent that this Article does not conflict with such terms, in accordance with this Article.
Applicability of Article
     SECTION 4.02. . In case the Company shall desire to exercise the right to redeem all, or, as the case may be, any part of a series of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 4.01, the Company shall fix a date for redemption
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Debt Securities
 
and the Company, or, at the Company's request, the Trustee in the name of and at the expense of the Company, shall mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the Holders of Debt Securities so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at their last addresses as the same appear on the Debt Securities Register. Such mailing shall be by first class mail. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Debt Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Security.
     Notice of redemption shall be given in the name of the Company and shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the place of payment (which shall be at the offices or agencies to be maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 5.02), that payment of the redemption price will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice,that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue, and the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which Debt Securities will be redeemed. In case less than all Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall also identify the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part and shall state that the redemption is for the sinking fund, if such is the case. In case any Debt Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Debt Security, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of such series in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued without charge to the Holder.
     If less than all the Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee notice, at least 45 days (or such shorter period acceptable to the Trustee) in advance of the date fixed for redemption, as to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities to be redeemed. Debt Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such Series or any multiple thereof. Thereupon the Trustee shall select, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Debt Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed, and shall as promptly as practicable notify the Company of the Debt Securities or portions thereof so selected. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Debt Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     On or prior to the date fixed for redemption specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 4.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with the paying agent an amount of money in the currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable sufficient to redeem on the date fixed for redemption all the Debt Securities so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.
 
     The Trustee shall not mail any notice of redemption of any series of Debt Securities during the continuation of any default in payment of interest on any series of Debt Securities when due or of any Event of Default, except that where notice of redemption with respect to any series of Debt Securities shall have been mailed prior to the occurrence of such default or Event of Default, the Trustee shall redeem such Debt Securities provided funds are deposited with it for such purpose.
     SECTION 4.03. . If notice of redemption has been given as herein provided, the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Debt Securities or portions thereof at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and such Debt Securities and portions of Debt Securities shall be deemed not to be Outstanding hereunder and shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture except to receive payment of the redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities at the place of payment in said notice specified, the said Debt Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that any installments of interest becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Debt Securities, or one or more previous Debt Securities evidencing all or a portion of the same debt as that evidenced by such particular Debt Securities, registered as such on the relevant record dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.08.
Payment of Debt Securities Called for Redemption
     Upon presentation and surrender of any Debt Security redeemed in part only, with, if the Company or the Trustee so required, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series having the same interest rate and Stated Maturity and bearing interest from the same date, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Debt Security so presented and surrendered.
     SECTION 4.04. . Debt Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in a written statement signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at least 45 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
 
     SECTION 4.05. . Unless the form or terms of any series of Debt Securities shall provide otherwise, in lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to such series of Debt Securities in cash, the Company may at its option (1) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Debt Securities of such series theretofore acquired by the Company, or (2) receive credit for any Debt Securities of such series (not previously so credited) acquired by the Company and theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, then Debt Securities so delivered or credited shall be credited at the applicable sinking fund Redemption Price with respect to the Debt Securities of such series.
Provisions with Respect to any Sinking Funds
     On or before the 45th day next preceding each sinking fund Redemption Date, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer, any Vice President, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company specifying (i) the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by deposit of cash in the currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable, by delivery of Debt Securities theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company (which Debt Securities shall accompany such certificate) and by credit for Debt Securities acquired by the Company and theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation redeemed by the Company and stating that the credit to be applied has not theretofore been so applied and (ii) whether the Company intends to exercise its right, if any, to make an optional sinking fund payment, and, if so, the amount thereof. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In case of the failure of the Company on or before the 45th day next preceding each sinking fund Redemption Date to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Debt Securities specified in this paragraph), the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash (in the currency described above) and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of Debt Securities as a mandatory sinking fund payment, without the option to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in the first paragraph of this Section 4.04 and without the right to make an optional sinking fund payment as provided herein.
     If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) with respect to any series of Debt Securities made in cash (in the currency described above) shall exceed the minimum authorized denomination set forth in an Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 3.01 or the equivalent in the currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request), unless otherwise provided by the terms of such series of Debt Securities, said cash shall be applied by the Trustee on the sinking fund Redemption Date with respect to Debt Securities of such series at the applicable sinking fund Redemption Price with respect to Debt Securities of such series, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption, with the effect provided in Section 4.03. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 4.02, for redemption on such sinking fund Redemption Date a sufficient principal amount of Debt Securities of such series to utilize said cash and shall thereupon cause notice of redemption of the Debt Securities of such series for the sinking fund to be given in the manner provided in Section 4.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 4.03) for the redemption of Debt Securities in part at the option of the Company. Debt Securities of any series which are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate at least 45 days prior to the sinking fund Redemption Date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Company or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or
 
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be excluded from Debt Securities of such series eligible for selection for redemption. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment with respect to Debt Securities of such series received by the Trustee and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.05. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to Debt Securities of any series held by the Trustee at the maturity of Debt Securities of such series, and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities of such series, shall be applied by the Trustee, together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of such series at maturity.
     The Trustee shall not convert any currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable for the purposes of such sinking fund application unless a Company Request is made, and any such conversion agreed to by the Trustee in response to such request shall be for the account and at the expense of the Company and shall not affect the Company's obligation to pay the Holders in the currency to which such Holder is entitled.
     On or before each sinking fund Redemption Date provided with respect to Debt Securities of any series, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash in the currency described above a sum equal to all accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption on Debt Securities to be redeemed on such sinking fund Redemption Date pursuant to this Section 4.05.
     SECTION 5.01. . The Company will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid (in the currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on each of the Debt Securities at the place (subject to Section 3.03), at the respective times and in the manner provided in each series of Debt Securities and in this Indenture.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
     SECTION 5.02. (a) So long as the Debt Securities of any series remain Outstanding, the Company will maintain at the Place of Payment, an office or agency where the Debt Securities may be presented for payment, an office or agency where the Debt Securities may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided, and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debt Securities or of this Indenture may be served and shall give the Trustee written notice thereof and any changes in the location thereof. In case the Company shall at any time fail to maintain any such office or agency, or shall fail to give notice to the Trustee of any change in the location thereof, presentation and demand may be made and notice may be served in respect of the Debt Securities or of this Indenture at said office of the Trustee.
Offices for Notices and Payments, etc.
     (b) In addition to the office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 5.02(a), the Company may from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Debt Securities may be presented for payment and presented for registration of transfer and for exchange in the manner provided in this Indenture, and the Company may
 
from time to time rescind such designations, as the Company may deem desirable or expedient; , , that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain such office and agency at the Place of Payment, for the purposes abovementioned. The Company will give to the Trustee prompt written notice of (i) any such designation or rescission thereof, and (ii) the location of any such office or agency outside the Place of Payment and of any change of location thereof.
provided
however
     SECTION 5.03. . The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 8.10, a Trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.
Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee's Office
     SECTION 5.04. . (a) (1) Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Debt Securities other than the Trustee, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Securities of such series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount becoming due, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

     In case the Trustee or any Holders shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the
 
Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
     SECTION 7.02. . The Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest upon any Debt Security of any series as and when the same shall become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days, or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on any Debt Security of any series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, whether at maturity of the Debt Security or upon redemption or by declaration or otherwise or (c) in case default shall be made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation with respect to the Debt Securities of any series when the same becomes due by the terms of the Debt Securities of any seriesthen, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of any such series, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on any such Debt Securities for principal and premium, if any, or interest, or both, as the case may be, with interest upon the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Debt Securities of such series or as otherwise provided in the form of Debt Security of such series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including a reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities incurred and advances made by the Trustee, except compensation or advances arising, or expenses or liabilities incurred, as a result of the Trustee's bad faith.
Payment of Debt Securities Upon Default; Suit Therefor

     In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on such Debt Securities and collect, in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on such Debt Securities wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable. If any Event of Default with respect to any series of Debt Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have been appointed for the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other similar judicial proceedings relative to the Company or other obligor upon the Debt Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Debt Securities of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.02, shall be entitled and empowered by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, (a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Debt Securities of such series, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on such Debt Securities, its or their creditors, or its or their property, (b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of any Debt Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and (c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of its charges and expenses; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Holders, to pay to the Trustee such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred and advances made by the Trustee except compensation or advances arising, or expenses or liabilities incurred, as a result of the Trustee's bad faith.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept, or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan or reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder (except, as aforesaid, for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions) in any such proceeding.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Debt Securities of any series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Debt Securities, or the production thereof on any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party), the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Debt Securities in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Debt Securities parties to any such proceedings.

For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities by any Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section 8.14 shall be deemed to be the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities "by the Trustee", and whenever this Indenture provides that "the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver" Debt Securities or that Debt Securities "shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee", such authentication and delivery by any Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery by the Trustee.

     In case at the time such successor to any such agency shall succeed to such agency any of the Debt Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to such Authenticating Agent may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Authenticating Agent and deliver such Debt Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Debt Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to any Authenticating Agent may authenticate such Debt Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Authenticating Agent; and in all cases such certificate shall have the full force which it has anywhere in the Debt Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the predecessor Authenticating Agent shall have had such force; , , that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Authenticating Agent or to authenticate Debt Securities in the name of any predecessor Authenticating Agent shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section 8.14, the Debt Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated herein issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.

     (c) In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing or if no Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes are included in Corporate Units and none of the Holders of the Separate Notes elect to have their Notes remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate.
     (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset on the Reset Effective Date to the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement, and the Company shall request the Depository to notify its Depository Participants holding Notes of the maturity date, Reset Rate, interest payment dates, and any other modified terms established for the Notes during the Remarketing on the Business Day following
 
the date of the Successful Remarketing. Upon a Successful Remarketing, the Reset Rate shall apply to all outstanding Notes, whether or not the Holders of all outstanding Notes participated in such Remarketing.
     (e) If there is a Failed Remarketing, the Company will cause a notice of the unsuccessful Remarketing to be published on the Business Day following the Applicable Remarketing Period (which notice, in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, shall be published not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, and shall include the procedures that must be followed if a Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right), in each case, by making a timely release to any appropriate news agency, including Bloomberg Business News and the Dow Jones News Service.

If, by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Remarketed Notes at the Remarketing Price pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof and of the Remarketing Agreement, or the Remarketing has not occurred because a condition precedent to the Remarketing has not been fulfilled, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred.
Failed Remarketing

Article III
     (c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Note shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto, together with such Holder's Separate Notes, to the Trustee by such Holder at or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date.

     Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates.

The Custodial Agent shall hold the Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes shall be held. Holders of Separate Notes electing to have their Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit L hereto, on or prior to 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Early Remarketing Period, and following such notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Notes to such holder.
          (e) The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement, including a prospectus, under the Securities Act with regard to the full amount of the Notes to be remarketed in each Remarketing in each case in a form that may be used by the Remarketing Agent in connection with such Remarketing shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
          (f) In the case of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of such Corporate Unit), upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio held by the Securities Intermediary on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the principal amount of the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio received by the Securities Intermediary shall be invested promptly in Permitted Investments of the type described in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments, which have been designated by the Company in writing from time to time in a standing instruction to the Securities Intermediary which shall be effective until revoked or superseded. On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, an amount equal to the Purchase Price for all related Purchase Contracts shall be remitted to the Company as payment of such Holder's Obligations under such Purchase Contracts without receiving any instructions from the Holder. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from either the related Pledged Treasury Securities or the related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and the Proceeds from such Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to distribute such excess, when received by the Securities Intermediary, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of the related Treasury Units or Corporate Units, as applicable.
          (g) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Fundamental Change Early Settlement or Cash Settlement or terminated upon a Termination Event, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the proceeds of the disposition of Collateral and the Purchase Price.
 
          (h) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Units unless the Company shall have received payment for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth.
     Section 5.04 . Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.05(b), on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Purchase Price payable on all Outstanding Units in accordance with Section 5.03 above, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder.
Issuance of Shares of Common Stock
Purchase Contract Settlement Fund
     Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.09 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes (including any applicable stamp taxes) required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.
     Section 5.05 . (a) Each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments (without duplication):
Adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate
          (i) . In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock (including any annual stock dividend), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of such dividend or other distribution and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
Stock Dividends
 
          (ii) . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock rights, warrants or options (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment or share purchase plans) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights, warrants or options at a price per share of Common Stock less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at the Current Market Price, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
Stock Purchase Rights
          (iii) . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification becomes effective.
Stock Splits; Reverse Splits; and Combinations
          (iv) . (1) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or property (but excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 5.05, any rights, options, warrants or other securities referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.05, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash referred to in paragraph (a)(v) of this Section 5.05, and any dividend, shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next subparagraph), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price and (y) the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (a)(iv)(1) is applicable, paragraph (a)(iv)(2) of this Section 5.05 shall not be applicable.
Debt, Asset or Security Distributions
 
          (2) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders of the Company entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the average of the Closing Prices of the capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period (the "") commencing on and including the third Trading Day after the date on which "ex-distribution trading" commences for such capital stock or securities distributed on the NYSE or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such capital stock or securities are listed or quoted and (2) the average of the Closing Prices of one share of Common Stock over the Relevant Period, and (y) the denominator of which is the average of the Closing Prices of one share of Common Stock over the Relevant Period. Any adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rate under this paragraph (a)(iv)(2) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (A) the 10th Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off and (B) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off.
Relevant Period
          (v) . In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, make a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock consisting exclusively of cash (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company) in an amount in excess of $0.13 per share of Common Stock per quarter (the ""), immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination and (y) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the per share amount of the distribution in excess of the Reference Dividend. The Reference Dividend will be subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever each Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted, but no adjustment will be made to the Reference Dividend for any adjustment made to the Fixed Settlement Rates pursuant to this clause (v).
Cash Distributions
Reference Dividend
          (vi) . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to shareholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of the Common Stock that exceeds the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on each of the five consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), then each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be equal to the sum of (1) the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the aggregate consideration payable for all Purchased Shares and (2) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time (excluding any Purchased Shares) and the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and (y) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (1) the Closing Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next
Tender Offers and Exchange Offers
Expiration Time
 
succeeding the Expiration Time and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any Purchased Shares) on the date of the Expiration Time, and "" shall mean all shares validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time.
Purchased Shares
          (vii) If any adjustments are made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.01(a) will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by the Adjustment Factor. The "" means, initially, a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after the first adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Each time an adjustment is required to be made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), the Adjustment Factor shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by this Section 5.05(a) during the Observation Period, the 20 individual Closing Prices used to determine the Applicable Market Value shall be adjusted rather than the Applicable Market Value and the Applicable Market Value shall be determined by (A) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days prior to such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate by the Adjustment Factor in effect prior to such adjustment, (B) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days following such adjustment by the Adjustment Factor reflecting such adjustment, and (C) dividing the sum of all such adjusted Closing Prices by 20.
Adjustment Factor
          (viii) . All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent in one or both Fixed Settlement Rates; , that if any adjustment is not required to be made because it would not change one or both of the Fixed Settlement Rates by at least one percent, the adjustment shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and that effect shall be given to all adjustments under this Section 5.05(a) no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the first Trading Day in the 20 consecutive Trading Days during which the Applicable Market Value is determined (or, if earlier, the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate is determined).
Calculation of Adjustments
provided
provided further
          (ix) . The Company may make such increases in each Fixed Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.05(a), as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of the Company's capital stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. The Company may only make such a discretionary adjustment if the Company makes the same proportionate adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate.
Increase of Settlement Rate
          (x) If the Company hereafter adopts any shareholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all
Rights
 
holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future shareholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case each Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.05(a)(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.
          (b) . (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.05(b)(ii), upon a Reorganization Event, each Unit shall thereafter, in lieu of a variable number of shares of Common Stock, be settled by delivery of a variable number of Exchange Property Units. An "" represents the right to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon that have a record date that is prior to the applicable Settlement Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property Unit that Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units would have been entitled to receive will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. The number of Exchange Property Units to be delivered upon settlement of a Purchase Contract following the effective date of a Reorganization Event shall equal the Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.05, determined as if the references to "shares of Common Stock" in Section 5.01(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) were to "Exchange Property Units."
Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event
Exchange Property Unit
Constituent Person
     In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, or merger or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Unit that remains Outstanding after the Reorganization Event (if any) shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.05(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments to the amount of any securities constituting all or a portion of an Exchange Property Unit which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such Reorganization Event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.05. The above provisions of this Section 5.05(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
          (ii) Prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then following such Fundamental Change a Holder of a Purchase Contract will have the right to accelerate and settle ("") such Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date at the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate; that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering the Common Stock and other securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
provided
 
used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement (it being understood that if there is a material business transaction or development with respect to the Company that has not yet been publicly disclosed, the Company shall not be required to provide Prospectus and the right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will not be available, until the Company has publicly disclosed such transaction or development; that the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to make such disclosure as soon as it is commercially reasonable to do so). In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its Fundamental Change Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement shall be effective.
provided
     Within fifteen Business Days of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Fundamental Change, which shall specify a date (the ""), which will be at least ten days after the date of the notice but no later than five Business Days prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, by which each Holder's right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement must be exercised. The notice will also set forth, among other things, the applicable Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date
     Corporate Units Holders (unless Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units) and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in multiples of 16,000 Corporate Units (or such other number of Corporate Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent upon a Successful Remarketing if the Reset Effective Date is not a regular Payment Date). Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01 shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
     In order to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "") equal to the product of (1) the Stated Amount times (2) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with this Section 5.05.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Amount
     In the event that Units are held by or through DTC or another Depositary, the exercise of the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur in conformity with the standing arrangements between DTC or such Depositary and the Purchase Contract Agent.
     Upon receipt of any such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental
 
Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
     Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) the Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount times (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     If a Holder properly effects an effective Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.05(b)(ii), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
          (A) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Fundamental Change (based on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate in effect at such time), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Fundamental Change provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Fundamental Change shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If the Fundamental Change causes the outstanding shares of Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of shareholder election) and the Holder exercises the right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement, the Company will deliver to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date consideration in the types and amounts as is proportional to the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election;
          (B) the Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Units with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Fundamental Change Early Settlement, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby; and
          (C) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
          (iii) The "" will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share for Common Stock in such Fundamental Change. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such Fundamental Change, the Stock Price paid per share will be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price paid per share will be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate
Effective Date
Stock Price
     The table above sets forth the hypothetical Stock Price and the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate per $50 Stated Amount of Units. The Stock Prices set forth in the first column heading of the table above will be adjusted upon the occurrence of events requiring adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.05(a). The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Fixed Settlement Rate as so adjusted. The number of shares will be adjusted in the same manner as the Fixed Settlement Rate as set forth in Section 5.05(a).
     If the Stock Price or Effective Date applicable to a Fundamental Change is not expressly set forth on the table, then the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be determined as follows:
          (1) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two dates on the table, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
          (2) if the Stock Price is in excess of $45.00 per share (subject to adjustment), then the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate shall be the Minimum Settlement Rate; and
 
          (3) if the Stock Price is less than $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment), then the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate shall be determined as if the Stock Price equaled the Minimum Stock Price, using the straight-line interpolation, as described in clause (1) above, if the Effective Date is between two dates on the table.
The maximum Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate shall be 7.3751 shares of Common Stock per $50 Stated Amount of Units.
          (c) No adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, so long as the distributed assets or securities the Holders would receive upon settlement of Units, if convertible, exchangeable, or exercisable, are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following settlement of the Units.
          (d) The Fixed Settlement Rate shall not be adjusted:
          (1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
          (2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
          (3) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Units were first issued;
          (4) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock;
          (5) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than to the extent contemplated by Section 5.05(a) hereof;
          (6) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock, in public or private transactions, for consideration in cash or property, at any price the Company deems appropriate; or
          (7) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock upon the exercise or conversion of any right, warrant or option described in Section 5.05(a)(ii).
          (e) Each adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate will result in a corresponding adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement. Each adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate will also result in a corresponding inverse adjustment to the Reference Price and the Threshold Appreciation Price.
 
          (f) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to this Agreement.
     Section 5.06 . (a) Whenever the Fixed Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.05 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware):

     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of March 16, 2009 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ""), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Collateral Agent, as Custodial Agent, as Securities Intermediary, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units from time to time, to which Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred. The Settlement Rate is subject to adjustment as described in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby that is settled through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate (in the case of a Fundamental Change Early Settlement).
     In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, unless a Termination Event shall have occurred, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or a Final Remarketing of the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes. A Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period make an effective Cash Settlement in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement or (2) on or prior to 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period (in the case of Corporate Units, unless a Successful Early Remarketing has occurred) or the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (in the case of Corporate Units after the occurrence of a Successful Early Remarketing), does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes held by the Collateral Agent in the Remarketing unless the Holder has previously made a Fundamental Change Early Settlement. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Notes as a component of Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term).
 
     As provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Interests in Notes, unless such Holder has elected Cash Settlement and delivered cash in accordance with Section 5.03(a) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Notes underlying such Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and to have elected to have the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under such Purchase Contracts.
     The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) forming a part of each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Note underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Corporate Units Holders the notice required by the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Upon the occurrence of a Successful Early Remarketing and receipt in the Collateral Account of the proceeds thereof, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio.
     Following the occurrence of a Successful Early Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Collateral Agent had in respect of Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and the underlying Notes, as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to the Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
     The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the
 
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for the Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Unit in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Notes, or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and Purchase Contract constituting such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit.
     Subject to, and in compliance with, the conditions and terms set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of Corporate Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Treasury Securities secure the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Treasury Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units for 20 Treasury Units. No Collateral Substitution is permitted following a Successful Early Remarketing.
     Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 16,000 Corporate Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
     Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Corporate Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 16,000 Corporate Units. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
     Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
 
     The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and the underlying Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, any payments with respect the Notes underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes (other than interest payments thereon) or the Proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
     The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such state.
     The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
     Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Corporate Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest payable on the Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

     (e) If, by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Remarketing Date, (1) the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Remarketed Notes, other than to the Company, at the applicable Remarketing Price pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof or (2) the Remarketing did not occur on such Remarketing Date because one of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof was not satisfied, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Remarketing Agent shall advise by telephone (and promptly deliver a notice in writing thereafter) the Depositary, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Company of any such Failed Remarketing. Whether or not there has been a Failed Remarketing will be determined in the sole reasonable discretion of the Remarketing Agent. In the event of a Failed Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will not be reset, and will continue to be the Coupon Rate set forth in the Supplemental Indenture.
     (f) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, by approximately 4:30 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall advise, by telephone:

     (c) The representations and warranties of the Company contained herein shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the applicable Remarketing Date, and the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and agreements contained herein or in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement to be performed on their part at or prior to such Remarketing Date.

     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and any person who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any loss, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Remarketing Agent or any such controlling person may incur under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, expense, liability or claim arised out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus taken together with any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses used at or prior to the time of the first sale (the "") or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such loss, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (i) therein in conformity with the information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent to the Company expressly for use in such documents or (ii) in the Form T-1 Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of the Indenture Trustee or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state therein a material fact in connection with such information required to be stated therein or necessary to make such information not misleading. The Company's agreement to indemnify the Remarketing Agent or any such controlling person as aforesaid is expressly conditioned upon the Company being notified of the action in connection therewith brought against the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person by letter or telegram or facsimile transmission addressed to the Company with reasonable promptness after the first legal process which discloses the nature of the liability or claim shall have been served upon the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person (or after the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person shall have received notice of such service upon any agent designated by the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person), but failure so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to the Remarketing Agent or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.
Disclosure Package
     The Company shall assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability or claim, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent or such
 
controlling person and the payment of all expenses. The Remarketing Agent or such controlling person against whom such suit is brought shall have the right to employ one separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Remarketing Agent or the expense of such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Company or (ii) the named parties to any such suit (including any impleaded parties) include the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person and the Company and the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on the behalf of the Remarketing Agent or on the behalf of such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any required local counsel) for the Remarketing Agent and such controlling persons, which firm (and local counsel, if any) shall be designated in writing by the Remarketing Agent. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Company from all liability arising out of such loss, expense, liability or claim.
     The Company agrees to notify the Remarketing Agent with reasonable promptness of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Company or any of its officers or directors in connection with the issue and sale of the Securities or with the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
     (b) The Remarketing Agent represents and warrants that the information furnished in writing to the Company expressly for use with reference to the Remarketing Agent in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and does not omit to state a material fact in connection with such information required to be stated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or necessary to make such information (in the case of the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which such information was provided) not misleading.
     The Remarketing Agent agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any loss, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any other indemnified person may incur under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which is in reliance on and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent to the Company expressly for use with
 
reference to the Remarketing Agent, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information required to be stated in any of such documents or necessary to make such information (in the case of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which such information was provided) not misleading. The Remarketing Agent's agreement to indemnify the Company and any other indemnified person as aforesaid is expressly conditioned upon the Remarketing Agent being notified of the action in connection therewith brought against the Company or any other indemnified person by letter, telegram, or facsimile transmission addressed to it at its address furnished to the Company for the purpose, with reasonable promptness after the first legal process which discloses the nature of the liability or claim shall have been served upon the Company or any other indemnified person (or after the Company or any such person shall have received notice of such service on any agent designated by the Company or any such person), but failure so to notify the Remarketing Agent shall not relieve the Remarketing Agent from any liability which it may have to the Company or any other indemnified person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.
     The Remarketing Agent shall assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability or claim, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Company or such other person and the payment of all expenses. The Company or other indemnified person against whom such suit is brought shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company or such other indemnified person unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Remarketing Agent or (ii) the named parties to any suit (including any impleaded parties) include the Company or such other indemnified person and the Remarketing Agent, and the Company or such other indemnified person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Remarketing Agent, in which case the Remarketing Agent shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the Company or such other indemnified person, it being understood, however, that the Remarketing Agent shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any required local counsel) for the Company and such person, which firm (and local counsel, if any) shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Remarketing Agent shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Remarketing Agent from all liability arising out of such loss, expense, liability or claim.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) and 7(b) above for any reason other than as specified therein in respect of any losses, expenses, liabilities or claims
 
referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the remarketing of the Remarketed Notes; or (ii) if the allocation provided in clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) to the Company from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Notes bears to the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any claim or action.
     (b) The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages that the Remarketing Agent have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 7 and Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent and,
 
in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent; provided, however, that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
     In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
     The Remarketing Agent, when acting as the Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (collectively, the ""). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
Securities
     The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Notes, and it shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the applicable Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is (i) judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or bad faith, gross
 
negligence or willful misconduct on its part or (ii) determined pursuant to Section 7 or 8 of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
     This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Termination Event and (y) the Business Day immediately following the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, in the event there has been a Successful Remarketing, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, Sections 7, 8 and 11 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent.
