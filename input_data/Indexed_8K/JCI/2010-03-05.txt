The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more Preliminary Final Prospectuses, each of which has previously been furnished to the Representatives. The Company will file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) a final supplement to the form of prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall include all information required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included therein with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to the Representatives prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised the Representatives, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein.

          (c) As of the Initial Sale Time, the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented as of the Initial Sale Time, and each electronic road show when taken together as a whole with the Disclosure Package, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
 
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and no Issuer Free Writing Prospectus includes any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified; provided, however, that the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Disclosure Package in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.

Agreements of the Company
          (a) During the period beginning with the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date as, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Final Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with the initial offering or sale of the Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless, in each case, the Company has furnished the Representatives a copy for their review prior to such time, and the Company will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filings.
          (b) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rules
 
424(b) and 433, respectively, (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof, including, if necessary, and subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
          (c) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, as set forth in Schedule IV hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
          (d) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event occurs as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of such event or, in circumstances where the Company's obligations under this paragraph (d) arise from an opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, notify the Representatives of such event after the Company receives such opinion, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment to the Registration Statement, a new registration statement or an amendment or supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representatives in such quantities as may be reasonably requested.
          (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the date hereof and otherwise satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158).
          (f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus,
 
the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          (g) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities (provided that the Company will not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now subject), will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors and will pay the fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in connection with its review of the offering.
          (h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for printing and engraving fees, for fees charged by the Trustee, for the expenses, if any, incurred by the Underwriters in road shows, for any filing fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority relating to the Securities and for expenses incurred in printing and distributing the Final Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectuses and any supplements thereto to the Underwriters. The Company will pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
          (i) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, prepare, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus where, as a result of such preparation, use, authorization, approval or reference, the Company would be required to file the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission or retain the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus under Rule 433 and the Company will not file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission (other than the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto, any electronic road show and any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package). Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (ii) it will comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
          (j) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Closing Date.
 
          (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
          (l) The Company will retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433.
          (m) The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
     5. . Each Underwriter agrees with the Company that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any Free Writing Prospectus (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III, any electronic road show or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus prepared pursuant to Section 4(i) above or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Schedule IV hereto without the consent of the Company.
Agreements of the Underwriters
     6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (vi) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
     (vii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the performance by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein, except (A) such as have been obtained under the Act or (B) such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any United States jurisdiction or the securities laws of any foreign jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained;
     (viii) none of the execution by the Company of this Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Securities or the performance by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement will result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, (A) any law of the United States of America or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law; (B) the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company; (C) the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound; or (D) any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of (C) for any such breach, violation or default that could not adversely affect in a material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or would otherwise be material in the context of the sale of the Securities; and
     (ix) the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and was filed with the Commission not earlier than the date three years before the Execution Time; any required filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made within the time period required by Rule 424(b); any required filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus of which such counsel has knowledge has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the Form T-1 and the financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder.
     In addition, such counsel shall state that he has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and any supplements
 
or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that (i) at the Effective Date immediately preceding the Execution Time the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except in each case for financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need not make any statement).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
          (c) The Representatives shall have received the opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company and the Trustee, constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect);
     (ii) assuming the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered by the Company, the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect); and
 
     (iii) to the extent that they constitute matters of law, summaries of legal matters or legal conclusions, the statements set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," "Description of the Debt Securities" and "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" are accurate in all material respects and fairly present the information provided.
     In addition, such counsel shall state that it has participated in conferences with certain officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that (i) at the Effective Date immediately preceding the Execution Time the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except in each case for financial statements and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need not make any statement).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of New York and Wisconsin or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
          (d) The Representatives shall have received from Mayer Brown LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion and 10b-5 statement, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, solely in their respective capacities as such, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any amendments or supplements thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there has been no Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplements thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
          (f) At the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the date of this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the
 
minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the board of directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus;
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any "capsule" information), audited or unaudited, in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, at a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of the letter, there were any changes in capital stock or increase in long-term debt as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding quarter in net revenues or in the total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur or it shall state any specific changes or decreases and the amount thereof; or
     (3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements
 
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined whether or not certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 1A, 2, 6, 7, 7A and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
          References to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any amendments or supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
          In addition, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, at the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth above.
          (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), there shall not have been (i) any change specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the effect of which in any case referred to in paragraph (g)(i) or (ii) of this Section 6, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or
 
have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
          (h) Subsequent to the earlier of the Initial Sale Time and the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purpose of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
          (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
     7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
Indemnification and Contribution
 
, , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, the percentage in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingDiscounts and Commissions" relating to concessions and the second sentence in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingPrice Stabilization and Short Positions" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have
provided
however
 
reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the
provided
however
 
Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). For the avoidance of doubt, the contribution obligations of the Underwriters under this paragraph (d) are several and not joint.
     9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
     10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred (1) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, act of terrorism, attack on the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or (2) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, and, with respect to either (1) or (2) above, the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
Termination
     11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
 
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
     12. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed and confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 5757 North Green Bay Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209, Attention: Secretary.
Notices
     13. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
     14. .

Exhibit 5.1
Johnson Controls, Inc. 5757 North Green Bay Avenue Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel for Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157502) (the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated February 23, 2009, and the final supplement to the prospectus, dated March 4, 2010 (collectively, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 5, 2010 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued under the Senior Indenture, dated January 17, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor Trustee (the "Trustee") and the Officers' Certificate, to be dated March 9, 2010 (the "Officers' Certificate") establishing the form and terms and providing for the issuance of the Securities.
     As counsel to the Company in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of the Securities, we have examined or are otherwise familiar with (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company; (ii) the By-Laws of the Company, as amended to date; (iii) the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus and exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference); (iv) the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate; and (v) such other documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us to render this opinion.
     In our examination of the above-referenced documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, assuming that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that the Securities, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
 
Johnson Controls, Inc. March 5, 2010 Page 2
will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We hereby consent to the deemed incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and to the reference to our firm therein. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Foley & Lardner LLP
