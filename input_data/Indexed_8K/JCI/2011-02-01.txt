Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
As described under Item 5.07 of this Current Report, at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Johnson Controls Inc. (the "Company") held on January 26, 2011, the stockholders of the Company approved the Johnson Controls, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan and the Johnson Controls, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plans"). The Plans were submitted to the shareholders of the Company as Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively, to the Johnson Controls, Inc. Proxy Statement (Schedule 14A) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2010.
On September 21, 2010, the Compensation committee of the Company's Board of Directors amended the Plans to expand or modify the performance measures to include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); trade working capital; return on sales; quality; and free cash flow. These performance measures were not previously approved by shareholders. In addition, the Plans enable the Company to pay compensation as "qualified performance-based compensation" for tax purposes pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"). In order to maintain Section 162(m) status, shareholders must approve the plan at least every five years. The Company sought shareholder approval since the Plans were last reviewed and approved by shareholders in 2006.
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") administers the Plans with respect to executive officers, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company administers the Johnson Controls, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan ("AIPP") with respect to all other participants (the "Administrator(s)"). The Administrators may delegate some or all of their authority to officers of the Company, except that the Committee may not delegate authority with respect to awards that are intended to comply with Section 162(m). In general, all key employees of the Company and of its affiliates are eligible to participate in these Plans.
The AIPP focuses on the Company's fiscal year business and financial objectives. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee approves the fiscal year performance objectives and a target incentive opportunity (which are measured as a percentage of base salary) for participants, as well as the potential incentive opportunity percentages for maximum and threshold performance. Performance measures are based on either overall corporate performance or performance at the relevant business unit.
No annual incentive payments are payable to participants if the relevant pre-established, minimum performance levels are not met. The financial based performance measures under the AIPP are based on the Company's annual financial statements (Form 10-K). The Company uses interpolation to determine the specific amount of the payout for each participant with respect to the achievement of financial goals between the various levels.
Annual awards which have a performance period of no more than one fiscal year may be granted under the AIPP. The fiscal year may be that of the Company or any affiliate, as determined by the Administrator. At the time it selects a participant, the Administrator will determine whether to grant an annual award to such participant. At the time it makes an award, the Administrator specifies the performance period, the potential amount that may be earned under the award and the performance goals that must be met for an amount to be paid.
Following the end of each performance period, the Administrator will certify the extent to which the performance goals established for that period and any other material terms of the award have been achieved. Based on this result, the Administrator will calculate the performance award amount for each participant. The Administrator has discretion to adjust the annual performance award amount up or down by 20% based on the participant's individual performance and attainment of the performance goals. However, for participants subject to Section 162(m), the Administrator may only adjust the award amount downward.
The Johnson Controls, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIPP") ties the value of awards to the Company's long-term performance over a three-year period. The LTIPP also focuses on the Company's fiscal year business and financial objectives. For each fiscal year, the Committee approves a target incentive opportunity (which is measured as a percentage of base salary) for each executive officer and key employees, as well as the potential incentive opportunity percentages for maximum and threshold performance. To calculate the payment an executive officer or key employee will receive under a long-term incentive award, the Administrator determines the performance results for each year in the three-year cycle, and calculates a weighted average for the three-year cycle based on the following: weighted 1/6 for the first year in performance cycle, weighted 2/6 for the second year in performance
 
cycle, and weighted 3/6 for the third year in the performance cycle. The financial based performance measures under the plan are based on our annual financial statements (Form 10-K).
The LTIPP does not specify target performance for the performance measures. The Administrator selects each performance measure and also establishes specific performance goals and a performance scale that will be used to measure performance and determine the amount payable.
The LTIPP permits the Administrator to grant prorated awards or additional awards after the beginning of a performance period to provide appropriate incentives to newly hired or newly-eligible key employees. The Administrator may also adjust an award to reflect a participant's demotion or promotion, or transfer of employment among the Company and its affiliates. The Administrator has the ability to change a participant's eligibility or award at any time.
Following the end of each performance period, the Administrator will certify the extent to which the performance goals established for that period and any other material terms of the award have been achieved. Based on this result, the Administrator (or its delegee) will calculate the performance award amount for each participant.
The Plans provide that in the event of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the Plans), participants will receive an immediate payment of the maximum amount that could be paid under the performance awards, but prorated to reflect the length of time that has elapsed since the first day of the performance period.
The Committee may from time to time or at any time suspend or terminate the Plans or amend them in any manner without obtaining further shareholder approval. However, if the Committee amends the Plans to increase the maximum amount that can be paid to a participant for any annual or long-term award or to change the financial performance categories or to increase the class of employees eligible to participate in the Plans, then further shareholder approval would be required to retain the benefits afforded by shareholder approval of the Plans under Section 162(m) in respect of awards to which such changes apply. In addition, the Employee Benefits Policy Committee of the Company may make ministerial or administrative amendments to the Plans or changes required for the Plans to comply with any applicable law.
These Plans are described in more detail in the Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Schedule 14A on December 10, 2010. The description of the Plans set forth above do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Plans, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report and are incorporated by reference herein.
As described under Item 5.07 of this Current Report, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") held on January 26, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting"), the stockholders of the Company voted on and approved the amendment of Article IV of its Restated Articles of Incorporation to adopt a majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors. A copy of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended through January 26, 2011, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein. The Company filed the approved amendment with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions as the Restated Articles of Incorporation to reflect the amendment on January 27, 2011.
On January 26, 2011, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the Company's By-Laws that related to the then-proposed amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, among other things, to change the director voting standard, which By-Law amendments include director resignation procedures that will apply to holdover directors. These By-Law amendments were effective only if the Company's shareholders approved the proposed amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation at the 2011 Annual Meeting. Since shareholders approved the amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the change to the By-Laws of the Company became effective upon filing of the Restated Articles of Incorporation on January 27, 2011. The By-Laws of the Company, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 3.1
     Pursuant to the authority and provisions of Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the existing Articles of Incorporation are hereby amended, superseded and restated to read as follows:
     The name of the corporation is Johnson Controls, Inc.
     The corporation is organized for the purpose of any lawful activity within the purposes for which corporations may be organized under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statues, including (without in any manner limiting by the following enumeration the generality of the foregoing) the manufacture, sale and installation of, and dealing in, automatic temperature and humidity controls for heating, cooling, ventilating, air-conditioning and industrial processing.
The aggregate number of shares which this Corporation has authority to issue is 1,802,000,000 shares, consisting of 1,800,000,000 shares of class of designated "Common Stock" of the par value of $0.01-7/18 per share and 2,000,000 shares of class designated "Preferred Stock" of the par value of $1.00 per share. Any and all such shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be issued for such consideration, not less than the par value thereof, as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any and all such shares so issued, the full consideration for which has been paid or delivered, shall be deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to any further call or assessment thereon, and the holders of such share shall not be liable for any further payments except as otherwise provided by applicable Wisconsin Statutes. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Board of Directors shall have no authority to cause any shares of Preferred Stock to be issued if, as a result of such issuance, the aggregate amount payable in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation on all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding would exceed $100,000,000. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of each class shall be as follows:
(A) Preferred Stock
     (1) Series of Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors shall (have) authority to divide the Preferred Stock into series, and shall determine and fix the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established prior to the issuance thereof, but only with respect to:
(a) The rate of dividend and the date from which such dividends shall be cumulative;
(b) The price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be redeemed;
(c) The amount payable upon shares in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation;
(d) Sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of share;
(e) The terms and conditions on which shares may be converted into shares of Common Stock, if the shares or any series are issued with the privilege of conversion.
(f) Voting rights, if any.
     Except as to the matters expressly set forth above in this Paragraph (1), all series of the Preferred Stock of the corporation, whenever designated and issued, shall have the same preferences, limitations and relative rights and shall rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.
 
     All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock hereinabove authorized shall be alike in every particular, and each series thereof shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words or figures.
     (2) Dividends
The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate per annum specified as to each series pursuant to Paragraph (1), and no more, payable quarterly on the last day of March, June, September, and December in each year for the respective calendar quarter ending on such dates ("Dividend Periods") out of the unreserved earned surplus of the corporation or out of any capital surplus legally available for the payment of such dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall accrue on each share of Preferred Stock from the first day of the Dividend Period in which such share is issued or from such other date as the Board of Directors may fix for this purpose pursuant to Paragraph (1). All dividends on Preferred Stock shall be cumulative so that if the corporation shall not pay or set apart for payment the dividend, or any part thereof, for any Dividend Period, on the Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding, such deficiency in the dividend on the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be fully paid or declared and set apart for payment, but without interest before any dividend shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment on the Common Stock. The holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any other or additional earnings or profits of the corporation, except for such premiums, if any, as may be payable in case of redemption, liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Any dividend paid upon the Preferred Stock at a time when any accrued dividends for any prior Dividend Period are delinquent shall be expressly declared to be in whole or partial payment of the accrued dividends to the extent thereof, beginning with the earliest Dividend Period for which dividends are then wholly or partly delinquent, and shall be so designated to each shareholder to whom payment is made.
No dividends shall be paid upon any shares of any series of Preferred Stock of the corporation for a current Dividend Period unless there shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment dividends required to be paid to the holders of each other series of Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods of such other series. If any dividends are paid on any of the Preferred Stock with respect to any past Dividend Period at any time when less than the total dividends then accumulated and payable for all past Dividend Periods on all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding are to be paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the dividends being paid shall be paid on each series of Preferred Stock in proportions that the dividends than accumulated and payable on each series for all past Dividend Periods bear to the total dividends then accumulated and payable for all such past Dividend Periods on all outstanding Preferred Stock.
     (3) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
     In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of each series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation in money or money's worth the amount specified pursuant to Paragraph (1) with respect to that series of Preferred Stock, together with all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not earned or declared), before any of such assets shall be paid or distributed to holders of Common Stock. In case of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, if the assets shall be insufficient to pay the holders of all of the series of Preferred stock then outstanding the full amounts to which they may be entitled, the holders of each outstanding series shall share ratably in such assets in proportion to the amounts which would be payable with respect to such series if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. The consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into nay restoration, or a sale of all or any part of its assets, shall not be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of this paragraph.
     (4) Redemption
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to a particular series pursuant to Paragraph (1), the following general redemption provisions shall apply to each series of Preferred stock (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as "Series"):
     On or prior to the date fixed for redemption of a particular Series or any part thereof as specified in the notice of redemption for said Series, the corporation shall deposit adequate funds for such redemption, in trust for the account of holders of the Series to be redeemed, with a bank having trust company in good standing organized under the laws
 
of the United States of America or the State of Wisconsin doing business in the State of Wisconsin and having capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and if the name and address of such bank or trust company and the deposit of or intent to deposit the redemption funds in such trust account shall have been stated in such notice of redemption, them from and after the mailing of such notice and the making of such deposit the shares of the Series called for redemption no longer be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and all rights of the holders of such share in or with respect to the corporation shall forthwith cease and terminate except only the right of the holders of such shares (2) to transfer such shares prior to the date fixed for redemption, (b) to receive out of said deposit the redemption price of such shares, which shall nevertheless include accrued but unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed, and (c) to exercise on or before the close of business on the fifth day preceding the date fixed for redemption privileges of conversion, if any, not theretofore expired.
     In case of redemption of only a part of a Series, the corporation shall designate by lot, in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine, the share to be redeemed, or shall effect such redemption pro rata.
     Any moneys so deposited by the corporation which shall remain unclaimed by the holders of the shares called for redemption and not converted shall, at the end of six years after the date fixed for redemption, be paid to the corporation upon its request, after which repayment the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall no longer look to the said bank or trust company for the payment of the redemption price but shall look only to the corporation or to others, as the case may be, for the payment of any lawful claim for such moneys which holders of said shares may still have. After said six-year period, the right of any shareholder other person to receive such payment may be forfeited in the manner and with the effect provided under Wisconsin Law. Any portion of the moneys so deposited by the corporation, in respect of shares of the Series converted into Common Stock, shall be repaid to the corporation upon its request.
     (5) Conversion Rights
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to a particular series pursuant to Paragraph (1), the following general conversion provisions shall apply to each series of Preferred Stock which is convertible into Common Stock (hereinafter, in this paragraph, referred to as "Series"):
     (a) All shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion shall be fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be free of all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof except taxes, if any, payable by reason of issuance in a name other than that of the holder of the share or shares converted and except as otherwise provided by applicable Wisconsin Statutes.
     (b) The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a particular Series at any time shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate conversion value, as herein provided, of the shares of that Series surrendered for conversion, by the price per share of Common Stock then in effect for that Series as herein provided. The corporation shall not be required, however, upon any such conversion, to issue any fractional share of Common Stock, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay to the shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional share if issued, a sum in case equal to the value of such fractional share at the rate of the then market value per share of Common Stock which for purposes hereof shall mean the last reported sale price of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Share of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of receipt at the office of the Transfer Agent of the certificates therefor, duly endorsed, together with written notice by the holder of his election to convert the same.
     (c) The basic conversion price per share of Common Stock for a particular Series, as provided for under the detailed description of the individual Series, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
          (i) In Case the corporation shall (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution of all holders of outstanding shares of its Common Stock as a class in shares of its Common Stock, (B) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of its Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (C) combine the outstanding shares of its Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the base conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted retroactively so that the holder of each outstanding share of each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the conversion of such share the number of shares of Common Stock of the corporation which he would have owned and been entitled to receive
 
after the happening of any of the events described above had such share of such Series been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (i) shall become effective retroactively immediately after such record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, split or combination. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
          (ii) In case the corporation shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock as a class any rights or warrants enabling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) at the record date fir determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the basic conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto for each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall be adjusted retroactively by multiplying such basic conversion price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such record date and the number of share of Common Stock which the aggregate exercise price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and other expenses of the corporation in connection with the issue) of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price per share of which the denominator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such record date and the number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (ii) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
          (iii) In case the corporation shall distribute to all holders of its Common Stock as a class evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends), the basic conversion price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior thereto for each Series of Preferred Stock which by its terms is convertible into Common Stock shall be adjusted retroactively by multiplying such basis conversion price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the difference between the current market price per share per share of Common Stock at the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution and the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends) so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall be the current market price per share of Common Stock. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (c) (iii) shall become effective retroactively immediately after such record date. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur.
     (d) For the purpose of any computation under clause (c) (iii) above, the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the high and low sale prices of the Common Stock of the corporation, as reported in the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions (or such other principal market quotation as may then be applicable to such Common Stock) for each of the 30 consecutive trading days commencing 45 trading days before such date.
     (e) For the purpose of making the computations prescribed in clause (c) of this Paragraph (5), no adjustment shall be made in the basic conversion price for any Series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such computation if the amount of such adjustment would be less than fifty cents; provided however, that any adjustments which by reason of this clause (e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and provided further that anything to the contrary in the foregoing notwithstanding any adjustment required for purposes of making the computations in said clause (c) shall be made not later than the earlier of (x) 3 years after the effective date provided for under said clause (c) for such adjustment or (y) the date as of which such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 3% in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the first date on which an event occurred which required the making of a computation prescribed in said clause (c). All calculations under this Paragraph (5) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be."
     (f) In the case of any capital reorganization or reclassification of Common Stock, or if the corporation shall be consolidated with or merged into, or sell or dispose of all substantially all of its property and assets, to any other corporation, proper provisions shall be made as part of the terms of such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale that any shares of a particular Series at the time outstanding shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of
 
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares of a particular Series would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger.
     (g) No adjustment with respect to dividends upon any Series or with respect to dividends upon Common Stock shall be made in connection with any conversion.
     (h) Whenever there is an issue of additional shares Common Stock of the corporation requiring a change in the conversion price as provided above, and whenever there occurs any other event which results in a change in the existing conversion rights of the holders of shares of a series, the corporation shall file and its transfer agent or agents and at its principal office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a statement signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, describing specifically such issue of additional shares of Common Stock or such other event (and, in the case of a capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, the terms thereof) and the actual conversion prices or basis of conversion as changed by such issue or event and the change, if any, in the securities issuable upon conversion. Whenever there are issued by the corporation to all holders of its Common Stock as a class any rights or warrants enabling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, the corporation shall also file in like manner a statement describing the same and the consideration receivable by the corporation therefrom. The statement so filed shall be open to inspection by any holder of record of shares of any Series.
     (i) The corporation shall at all times have authorized and shall at all times reserve and set aside a sufficient number of duly authorized shares of Common Stock for the conversion of all stock of all then outstanding Series which are convertible into Common Stock.
     (6) Reissuance of Shares
     Any shares of Preferred Stock retired by purchase, redemption, through conversion or through the operation of any sinking fund or redemption or purchase account, shall thereafter have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation, and may thereafter be reissued as part of the same series or may be reclassified and reissued by the Board of Directors in the same manner as any other authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock.
     (7) Voting Rights of Preferred Stock
          (a) Ordinary Voting Rights. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such class held on all questions on which shareholders of the corporation are entitled to vote and shall vote together share for share with the holders of Common Stock as one class, except as otherwise provided by law or as hereinafter otherwise provided or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the establishment of such Series of Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (f) of Paragraph (1) of this Section (A).
          (b) Special Voting Rights. Holders of Preferred Stock shall have voting rights as provided in the preceding clause (a) and, in addition, the following special voting rights:
     (i) Election of Directors. Whenever dividends payable on any series of the Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends on the shares of all of the Preferred Stock of that series then outstanding, the holders of Preferred Stock of that series shall have the exclusive and special right voting separately as a class, to elect two directors of the corporation, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased to the extent necessary to effectuate such right. Whenever such right of the Board of Directors shall be increased to the extent necessary to effectuate such right. Whenever such right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall have vested, such right may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided in clause (b) (ii), or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders. The right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class to elect members of the Board of Directors of the corporation as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such series of the Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time the special right of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock so to vote separately as a class for the election of directors shall terminate, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default in an aggregate amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends.
 
     (ii) Special Meetings of Holders of Preferred Stock. At any time when such special voting power shall have vested in the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock as hereinbefore provided in clause (b) (i), a proper officer of the corporation shall, upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 10% of such series of the Preferred Stock then outstanding addressed to the Secretary of the corporation, call a special meeting of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock for the purpose of electing directors pursuant to clause (b) (i). Such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date in such place as may be designated pursuant to the By-laws (or if there be no designation, at the principal offices of the corporation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin). If such meeting shall not be called by the proper officers of the corporation within 20 days after personal service of the said written request upon the Secretary of the corporation, or within 30 days after mailing the same within the United States of America by registered or certified mail addressed to the Secretary of the corporation at its principal office, then the holders of record of at least 10% of such series of the Preferred Stock then outstanding may designate in writing one of their numbers to call such meeting at the expense of the corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated upon the notice required for annual meetings of shareholders and shall be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Any holder of such series of Preferred Stock so designated shall have access to the stock books of the corporation for the purpose of causing meeting of shareholders to be called pursuant to these provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this clause (b) (ii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 90 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of shareholders.
     (iii) Special Rules Applicable While Any Series of Preferred Stock Has Special Voting Rights. At any annual or special meeting at which the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall have the special right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors as provided in clause (b) (i), the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of 33-1/3% of such series of the Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such series for the election of any director by the holders of such series as a class. At any such meeting or adjournment thereof, (A) the absence of a quorum of such series of the Preferred Stock shall not prevent the election of directors other than those to be elected by such series of the Preferred Stock voting as a class, and the absence of a quorum for the election of such other directors shall not prevent the election of the directors to be elected by such series of the Preferred Stock voting as a class and (B) in the absence of either or both such quorums, a majority of the holders present in person or by proxy of the stock or stocks which lack a quorum shall have power to adjourn the meeting for the election of directors which they are entitled to elect from time to time until a quorum shall be present, without notice other than announcement at the meeting.
     During any period in which the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock have the right to vote as a class for directors as provided in clause (b) (i), any vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be filled only be vote of a majority (even if that be only a single director) of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the series or class of stock which elected the directors whose office shall have become vacant. During such period the directors so elected by the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock shall continue in office (A) until the next succeeding annual meeting or until their successors, if any are elected by such holders and qualify, or (B) unless required by applicable law to continue in office for longer period, until termination of the right of the holders of such series of the Preferred Stock to vote as a class for directors, if earlier. If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately upon any termination of the right of the holders of any series of the Preferred Stock to vote as a class for directors as provided in clause (b) (i), the term of office of the directors then in office so elected by the holders of such series shall terminate.
     (iv) Action Requiring Approval of Two-Thirds of Outstanding Shares of Each Series of Preferred Stock.

     (B) To change the designations, preferences, limitations, or relative rights of the outstanding shares or such series of Preferred Stock in any manner prejudicial to the holders thereof.
          (v) Action Requiring Approval of a Majority of Outstanding Shares of Each Series of Preferred Stock. The affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each series of Preferred Stock shall be a prerequisite to the right of the corporation to authorize any shares of Preferred Stock in excess of
 
2,000,000 shares or any other shares ranking on a parity with Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
     (8) Restrictions in Event of Default in Dividends on Preferred Stock

     (A) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suite or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connect with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
 
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
     (B) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.
     (C) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in the preceding Sections (A) and (B) of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     (D) Any indemnification under Sections (A) or (B) of this Article VI, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such Sections. Such determination shall be made:
          (1) By the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding.
          (2) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion;
          (3) By the shareholders; or
          (4) By the chief legal officer of the corporation only in the following circumstances
(a) the indemnified is a non-officer, non-director employee of the corporation, and
     (b) the chief legal officer reasonably concludes that the actions of the indemnified were in accordance with the laws of the U.S. and Wisconsin, meet the requirements of this Article and were in accordance with the current Ethics Policy of the corporation; the chief legal officer reports fully on such decisions to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at its next meeting.
     (E) Expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in Section (D) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.
     (F) The right to indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     (G) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.
These Restated Articles of Incorporation supersede and take the place of the existing Articles of Incorporation and all amendments to the Articles of Incorporation through January 26, 2011.

In the case of any Special Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, or the President upon the demand of shareholders (a "Demand Special Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such hour and day as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than 70 days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Article II, Section 5); and provided further that in the event that the directors then in office fail to designate an hour and date for a Demand Special Meeting within 10 days after the date that valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at the special meeting are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 P.M. local time on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting, the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he or it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of his or its business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting, and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting for the conduct of related business.
          (f) The Corporation may engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Special Meeting received by the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).
          (g) For purposes of these By-Laws, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
     . . The Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or the President may designate any place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place of meeting for any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, or for any postponement thereof, and in case the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or the President shall fail or neglect to make such designation, the Secretary shall designate the time and place of such meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be reconvened at any place designated by vote of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or the President.
Section 3
PLACE OF MEETING
     . . The Corporation shall send written or printed notice stating the place, day and hour of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting not less than 10 days nor more than 70 days before the date of such meeting either personally or by mail to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to other shareholders as may be required by law or by the Restated Articles of Incorporation. In the event of any Demand Special Meeting, such notice of meeting shall be sent not more than 30 days after the Delivery Date. If mailed, such notice of meeting shall be addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the Corporation's record of shareholders. Unless otherwise required by law or the Restated Articles of Incorporation, a notice of an Annual Meeting need not include a description of the purpose for which the meeting is called. In the case of any Special Meeting, (a) the notice of meeting shall describe any business that the Board of Directors shall have theretofore determined to bring before the meeting and (b) in the case of a Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i) shall describe any business set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by the Corporation in accordance with Article II, Section 2 of these By-Laws and (ii) shall contain all of the information required in the notice received by the Corporation in accordance with Article II, Section 13(b)(ii) of these By-Laws.

Section 5
FIXING OF RECORD DATE
 
more than 70 days prior to the date of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the 30th day after the Deliver Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th day shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders is effective for any adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
     . . After a record date has been fixed for a meeting of shareholders, the Secretary or agent having charge of the shareholder record shall prepare a list of the names of all of the shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by class or series of shares and shall show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning 2 business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.

Section 7
QUORUM; POSTPONEMENTS; ADJOURNMENTS
          (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Articles of Incorporation, when specified business is to be voted upon by one or more classes or series of shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group, the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for the transaction of such business. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present, for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.
          (b) The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled Annual Meeting or Special Meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date. Any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution of shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the Chairman of the Board or pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
     . . At all the meetings of shareholders, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote his or her shares in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months from the date of its signing unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.
Section 8
PROXIES
     . . Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, holders of Common Stock and holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of each such class held on all questions on which shareholders are entitled to vote, and the holders of Common Stock and the holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together as one class.
Section 9
VOTING OF SHARES
     . . If the name signed on a vote, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the corporation may accept the vote, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:
Section 10
ACCEPTANCE OF INSTRUMENTS SHOWING SHAREHOLDER ACTION
 
          (a) The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
          (b) The name purports to be that of a personal representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation is presented with respect to the vote, waiver or proxy appointment.
          (c) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation is presented with respect to the vote, waiver or proxy appointment.
          (d) The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder is presented with respect to the vote, waiver or proxy appointment.
          (e) Two or more persons are the shareholder as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners.
     . . A shareholder may waive any notice whatever required to be given to any shareholder of the corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or any provision of law, by a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the date and time stated in the notice, by the shareholder entitled to such notice; provided that such waiver shall contain the same information as would have been required to be included in such notice under any applicable provisions of Chapter 180, Wisconsin Statutes, except the time and place of meeting, and shall be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the corporate records. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting, in person or by proxy, waives objection to the following: (a) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.
Section 11
WAIVER OF NOTICE BY SHAREHOLDERS
     . The Corporation or its authorized officers, agents or other representatives may reject a vote, waiver, proxy appointment, request to fix a Demand Record Date or demand for a Special Meeting if the Secretary or other duly authorized officer or agent of the Corporation, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature or signatures on it, about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder or about any other matter affecting the validity of such vote, waiver, proxy appointment, request or demand.

and (d) with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by paragraph (d) of this Section 13. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to

th
 
serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
               (iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 13 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 13 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

th
          (c) .
General
               (i) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 shall be eligible to serve as directors. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 13, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.
               (ii) For purposes of this Section 13, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
               (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13; provided, however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to limit the requirements applicable to nominations or shareholder action pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) or paragraph (b) of this Section 13. Nothing in this Section 13 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
          (d) .
Required Vote for Directors
               (i) . Election of directors at all meetings of the shareholders at which directors are to be elected shall be by ballot. Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 13, a majority of the votes cast at any meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present shall elect directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under
Majority voting in uncontested director elections
 
specified circumstances. For purposes of this By-Law, a "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes "for" and "against" that director's election and direction to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions and broker nonvotes with respect to that director's election.
               (ii) . In the event of a "contested election" of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this By-Law, a "contested election" means any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary makes this determination (i) the day after the meeting of the Board of Directors at which the nominees for director of the Board of Directors for such election are approved, when such meeting occurs after the last day on which a shareholder may propose the nomination of a director for election in such election pursuant to the Restated Articles of incorporation or these By-Laws, or (ii) the day after the last day on which a shareholder may propose the nomination of a director for election in such election pursuant to the Restated Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, when the last day for such a proposal occurs after the meeting of the Board of Directors at which the nominees for director of the Board of Directors for such election are approved, whichever of clause (i) or (ii) is applicable. This determination that an election is a "contested election" shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity. In all cases, once an election is determined to be a contested election, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.
Contested elections
     . . The Chairman of the Board of Directors, and in his absence (or if no person then holds such office), the President, and in his absence, any officer or director designated by the President, and in his absence, a Vice President in the order provided under Section 6 of Article IV of the By-Laws, and in their absence, any person chosen by the shareholders present shall call any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of the meeting, and the Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the shareholders, but, in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the meeting. The Board of Directors may, to the extent not prohibited by law, adopt by resolution any rules and regulations for the conduct of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as it deems appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to act or to prescribe any rules, regulations, or procedures as the chairman of the meeting deems appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations, or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may to the extent not prohibited by law include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies (which shall be reasonable in number) or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the meeting's commencement; (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (f) rules and procedures regarding the execution of election ballots before or after the time fixed for the commencement of the meeting; (g) the appointment of an inspector of election or an officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes; and (h) rules and procedures to facilitate the conduct of, and participation in, the meeting by electronic means. The chairman of the meeting shall determine the time at which the polls shall close for each matter to be voted on at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting but shall not be obligated to announce the closing of such polls at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting or otherwise.
Section 14
CONDUCT OF MEETING
     . . All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of a Board of Directors comprised of not less than nine (9) nor more than thirteen (13) members divided into three classes, to consist of three to four members each, depending on the size of the Board of Directors, and the term of office of one class shall expire at each annual meeting. The number of directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he is elected and until his death or until he shall resign or shall have been removed from office. Any director may be removed
Section 1
NUMBER AND TENURE QUALIFICATIONS
 
from office by shareholders prior to the expiration of his or her term, but only (i) at a special meeting called for the purpose of removing the director, (ii) by the affirmative vote of the number of outstanding shares set forth in the Restated Articles of Incorporation and (iii) for cause as hereinafter defined; provided, however, that, if the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by the Requisite Vote (as hereinafter defined), shall have recommended removal of a director, then the shareholders may remove such director without cause by the vote referred to above. As used herein, "cause" shall exist only if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction, where such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal, or has been adjudged liable for actions or omissions in the performance of his or her duty to the Corporation in a matter which has a materially adverse effect on the business of the Corporation, where such adjudication is no longer subject to appeal. As used herein, the term "Requisite Vote" shall mean the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then in office plus one director. Any action by the Board of Directors, other than pursuant to a Requisite Vote, or shareholders eliminating the requirement to establish cause for the removal of a director shall not operate to eliminate such requirement with respect to any director incumbent at the time of such action. The Board of Directors, at the regular meeting thereof held immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders, may elect one of its members to act as its Chairman until his successor is elected or his prior death, resignation or removal; and such Chairman shall, when present, preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and perform all such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board from time to time.
     . . A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be held without notice other than this By-Law immediately after, and at the same place as the annual meeting of the shareholders and each adjourned session thereof. The Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place either within or without the State of Wisconsin for the holding of additional regular meetings without notice other than such resolution.
Section 2
REGULAR MEETINGS
     . . Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, or any two directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix the time and place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, for the holding of any special meeting of the Board of Directors called by them.
Section 3
SPECIAL MEETINGS
     . Notice of any special meeting shall be given at least six hours prior to such meeting if given orally or in writing to each director at his business address, which shall include the director's business e-mail address. If notice is given by mail, private carrier, or overnight courier or other commercial delivery service only, it shall be given at least forty-eight hours prior to such meeting. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any director of the corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or any provision of law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the time of the meeting, by the director entitled to such notice and retained by the corporation, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a director at or participation in a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.
Section 4. NOTICE
     . . Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws a majority of the number of directors fixed by Section 1 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors.

If payment is approved by the Administrator notwithstanding the withdrawal of approval, the payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3, after the end of the Performance Period, and the payment amount shall equal the award amount calculated under Section 5.1, reduced in such manner or by such amount (if at all) as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. A Participant shall be notified of the Administrator's withdrawal of its approval for the Participant's participation in the Plan as soon as practicable following such action.

Section 3.3.
Transfers In, Out and Between Eligible Positions
          (a) Notwithstanding Section 3.1, if a key employee is hired or promoted into a position that is eligible for an Annual Performance Award, the Administrator may (1) select such key employee as a Participant at any time during the course of a Performance Period, (2) take action resulting in a key employee's receipt of an additional Annual Performance Award, where, with respect to a particular Performance Period already in progress, the key employee is currently a Participant in the Plan and already has an Annual Performance Award for that Performance Period, or (3) change the Performance Goals, Performance Measures, Performance Scale or potential award amount under an Annual Performance Award that is already in effect; that the Administrator may not apply the discretion described in clause (3) with regard to any Annual Performance Award that is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). The Administrator may, but is not required to, prorate the amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant under such Annual
provided
 
Performance Award had the Participant been employed during the entire Performance Period to reflect the Participant's actual period of employment during the Performance Period.
          (b) If a Participant is demoted during a Performance Period, the Administrator may decrease the potential award amount of any Annual Performance Award the Participant may be eligible to receive, or revise the Performance Goals, Performance Measures or Performance Scale applicable to the Participant (provided that any such revision as applied to an individual who is a covered employee under Code Section 162(m) may result only in a reduction of the amount that would have otherwise been payable absent such revision), as the Administrator determines is necessary to reflect the Participant's demotion, or the Administrator may withdraw its approval for the Participant's participation in the Plan in accordance with Section 3.2.
          (c) If a Participant is transferred from employment by the Company to the employment of an Affiliate, or vice versa, the Administrator may revise the Participant's Annual Performance Award to reflect the transfer, including but not limited to, changing the potential award amount, Performance Measures, Performance Goals and Performance Scale applicable to the Participant (provided that any such revision as applied to an individual who is a covered employee under Code Section 162(m) may result only in a reduction of the amount that would have otherwise been payable absent such revision).
           .
Section 3.4.
Termination of Employment
          (a) Except as otherwise provided under the terms of an employment or severance agreement between a Participant and the Company, no Participant shall earn an incentive award for a Performance Period unless the Participant is employed by the Company or an Affiliate (or is on an approved leave of absence) on the last day of such Performance Period, unless the Participant's employment was terminated during the year as a result of Retirement, Total and Permanent Disability or death at a time when the Participant could not have been terminated for Cause, or unless payment is approved by the Administrator after considering the cause of the Participant's termination. If payment is approved by the Administrator, the payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3, after the end of the Performance Period, and the payment amount shall equal the award amount calculated under Section 5.1, reduced in such manner or by such amount (if at all) as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.
          (b) If a Participant's employment is terminated as a result of death, Total and Permanent Disability or Retirement, at a time when the Participant could not have been terminated for Cause, then unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate in the event of his or her death) shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (x) the award amount calculated under Section 5.1 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Participant's whole calendar months of employment during the Performance Period for such award and the denominator of which is the number of calendar months in the Performance Period for such award. Payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3.
 
          The Administrator shall determine, at the time an Annual Performance Award is granted, the Performance Period, the Performance Measure(s), the Performance Goal(s) for such Performance Measure, the Performance Scale (which may vary for different Performance Measures), and the amount payable to the Participant if and to the extent the Performance Goals are met (as measured under the Performance Scale). The amount payable to a Participant for meeting the Performance Goal(s) may be designated as a flat dollar amount or as a percentage of the Participant's Base Salary, or may be determined by any other means specified by the Administrator at the time the Annual Performance Award is granted.
           .
Section 5.1.
Evaluating Performance and Computing Awards
          (a) As soon as practicable following the close of a Performance Period, the Administrator shall determine and certify whether and to what extent the Performance Goals and other material terms of the Annual Performance Award for that Performance Period were satisfied, and shall determine whether any discretionary adjustments under Subsection (b) shall be made. Based on such certification, the Administrator (or its delegate) shall determine the award amount payable to a Participant under the Annual Performance Award for that Performance Period, that the maximum award amount for any Participant shall be, with respect to any and all Annual Performance Awards of such Participant with Performance Periods covering (or ending within) the same fiscal year of the Company, no more than six million dollars ($6,000,000).
provided
          (b) The Administrator may adjust each Participant's potential award amount under any Annual Performance Award, based upon overall individual performance and attainment of goals, as follows:
           . When the payment due to the Participant has been determined, unless otherwise deferred pursuant to a Participant's election
Section 5.2.
Timing and Form of Payment
 
under the Company's deferred compensation plan, payment shall be made in a cash lump sum by the 75 day following the close of the Performance Period.
th
           . Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the end of the Performance Period for which a payment for an Annual Performance Award has accrued, but before payment or deferral of such amount actually occurs, if the Participant engages in Inimical Conduct, or if the Company determines after a Participant's termination of employment that the Participant could have been terminated for Cause, the Annual Performance Award shall be automatically cancelled and no payment or deferral shall be made. The Administrator may suspend payment or deferral (without liability for interest thereon) pending the Administrator's determination of whether the Participant was or should have been terminated for Cause or whether the Participant has engaged in Inimical Conduct.
Section 5.3.
Inimical Conduct
           . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, within thirty (30) days after a Change of Control (as defined below), the Company shall pay each Participant, with respect to each Annual Performance Award of the Participant, a lump sum payment in cash equal to the product of (x) such Participant's maximum potential award amount for the Performance Period(s) in which the Change of Control occurs, as specified in the Annual Performance Award and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days after the first day of the Performance Period on which the Change of Control occurs and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period. If, however, the Participant has a deferral election in effect with respect to any amount payable under this Section 6.1, such amount shall be deferred pursuant to such election and shall not be paid in a lump sum as provided herein.
Section 6.1.
Acceleration of Payment
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to amounts payable to a Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate) who is entitled to a payment hereunder because the Participant's employment terminated as a result of death or Disability, or payable to a Participant who has met the requirements for Retirement (without regard to whether the Participant has terminated employment), no payment shall be made unless the Change of Control (as defined below) also constitutes a change of control within the meaning of Code Section 409A.
           . A "Change of Control" means any of the following events:
Section 6.2.
Definition of Change of Control
          (a) The acquisition, other than from the Company, by any individual, entity or group of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule l3d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), including in connection with a merger, consolidation or reorganization, of more than either:
 
, that any acquisition by (x) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (y) any corporation with respect to which, following such acquisition, more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, shall not constitute a Change in Control of the Company; or
provided, however
          (b) Individuals who, as of October 1, 2005, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board during any twelve (12)-month period, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to October 1, 2005, whose election or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board, shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
provided
          (c) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than to a corporation with respect to which, following such sale or disposition, more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, immediately prior to such sale or disposition. For purposes hereof, "a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company" will not be deemed to have occurred if the sale involves assets having a total gross fair market value of less than forty percent (40%) of the total gross fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to the acquisition. For this purpose, "gross fair market value" means the value of the assets without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
          For purposes of this Section 6.2, persons will not be considered to be acting as a "group" solely because they purchase or own stock of the Company at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a "group" if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in the Company and any other corporation that enters into a merger,
 
consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in such corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the Company.
          In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, then if the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, that such change necessarily or equitably requires an adjustment in the Performance Goals established under an Annual Performance Award, such adjustments shall be made by the Administrator and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Plan. No adjustment shall be made in connection with the issuance by the Company of any warrants, rights, or options to acquire additional shares of Common Stock or of securities convertible into Common Stock.
          If permitted by the Company, a Participant may designate a Beneficiary by filing a beneficiary designation on the form provided by the Administrator. In such event, if the Participant dies prior to receiving any payment due hereunder, such payment shall be made to the Participant's Beneficiary. If, however, the Participant has an effective deferral election in place for such amount under the Company's deferred compensation plan, then the amount shall be deferred and paid in accordance with that plan. A Participant entitled to file a beneficiary designation may change his beneficiary designation at any time, that each beneficiary designation form filed with the Company shall revoke the most recent form on file, and the last form received by the Company while the Participant was alive shall be given effect. In the event there is no valid beneficiary designation form on file, or in the event the Participant's designated Beneficiary is not alive at the time payment is to be made, or in the event a Participant is not entitled to file a beneficiary designation, the Participant's estate will be deemed the Beneficiary and will be entitled to receive payment. If a Participant designates his spouse as a beneficiary, such beneficiary designation automatically shall become null and void on the date of the Participant's divorce or legal separation from such spouse; the Administrator has notice of such divorce or legal separation prior to payment.
provided
provided
           . No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset or assets of the Company (or any Affiliate) by reason of any Annual Performance Award under the Plan. It is intended that the Company has merely a contractual obligation to make payments when due hereunder and it is not intended that the Company (or any Affiliate) hold any funds in reserve or trust to secure payments hereunder.
Section 9.1.
No Funding
 
           . No Participant may assign, pledge, or encumber his interest under the Plan, or any part thereof, except that a Participant may designate a Beneficiary as provided herein.

          (a) Give any employee or Participant any right to receive any award other than in the sole discretion of the Administrator;
          (b) Limit in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time; or
          (c) Be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that a Participant will be retained in any particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration.
           . The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator. If at any time the Committee shall not be in existence, the Board shall assume the Committee's functions and each reference to the Committee herein shall be deemed to include the Board.
Section 10.1.
General
           . In addition to the authority specifically provided herein, the Administrator shall have full power and discretionary authority to: (a) administer the Plan, including but not limited to the power and authority to construe and interpret the Plan; (b) correct errors, supply omissions or reconcile inconsistencies in the terms of the Plan or any Annual Performance Award; (c) establish, amend or waive rules and regulations, and appoint such agents, as it deems appropriate for the Plan's administration; and (d) make any other determinations, including factual determinations, and take any other action as it determines is necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
Section 10.2.
Authority
           . The Administrator may delegate to one or more officers of the Company any or all of the authority and responsibility of the Administrator, except that the Committee may not delegate any authority with respect to Annual Performance Awards that are intended to comply with Code Section 162(m). If the Administrator has made such a delegation, then all references to the Administrator in this Plan include such officer(s) to the extent of such delegation.
Section 10.3.
Delegation of Authority
           . The Administrator's determinations and decisions made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and all related orders or resolutions of the Board shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons who have an interest in the Plan or an Annual Performance Award, and such determinations and decisions shall not be reviewable.
Section 10.4.
Decision Binding
           . The Committee's determinations must be made by not less than a majority of its members present at the meeting (in person or otherwise) at which a quorum is present, or by written majority consent, which sets forth the action, is signed by each member of the Committee and filed with the minutes for proceedings of
Section 10.5.
Procedures of the Committee
 
the Committee. A majority of the entire Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Service on the Committee shall constitute service as a director of the Company so that the Committee members shall be entitled to indemnification, limitation of liability and reimbursement of expenses with respect to their Committee services to the same extent that they are entitled under the Company's By-laws and Wisconsin law for their services as directors of the Company.
           . The Committee may modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, and may suspend the Plan, and the Employee Benefits Policy Committee (or any successor committee thereto) of the Company may modify or amend the Plan for ministerial or administrative changes or to conform the terms of the Plan to the requirements of applicable law; that, any such amendment or modification shall be approved by the Company's shareholders to the extent required by Code Section 162(m) or other applicable law; that no such modification, amendment, or suspension may, without the consent of the Participant or his or her Beneficiary in the case of the Participant's death, reduce the right of a Participant, or his or her Beneficiary, as the case may be, to any payment due under the Plan except as specifically provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the provisions of Article 6 prior to the effective date of a Change of Control.
Section 11.1.

In order for the provisions of this Section 11.2 to apply, the Committee must designate in writing that the Plan is being terminated in accordance with this Section. Upon termination of the Plan, the Committee may provide that all amounts accrued under the Plan to the date of the Plan termination (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) be paid in a lump sum, provided that payments to a Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate) who is entitled to a payment hereunder because the Participant's employment terminated as a result of death or Disability prior to the date of such Plan termination, or amounts payable to a Participant who has met the requirements for Retirement (without regard to whether the Participant has terminated employment) as of the date of such Plan termination may be paid upon termination of the Plan only in the following circumstances:
Section 11.2.
Termination
          (a) The Plan is terminated within twelve (12) months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Code Section 331, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(A). In such event, the payment must be paid no later than the latest of: (A) the last day of the calendar year in which the Plan termination occurs, (B) the first calendar year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or (C) the first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.
          (b) The Plan is terminated at any other time, provided that such termination does not occur proximate to a downturn in the financial health of the Company or an Affiliate, and all other plans required to be aggregate with this Plan under Code Section 409A are also terminated and liquidated. In such event, the payment shall be paid no earlier than twelve (12) months (and no later than twenty-four (24) months) after the date of termination.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment that would otherwise be paid during the twelve (12)-month period beginning on the Plan termination date pursuant to the terms of the Plan shall be paid in accordance with such terms. In addition, the Company or any Affiliate shall be prohibited from adopting a similar arrangement within three (3) years following the date of the Plan's termination

          The Company shall have the right to offset from any amount payable hereunder any amount that the Participant owes to the Company or to any Affiliate without the consent of the Participant (or his Beneficiary, in the event of the Participant's death).
          All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Annual Performance Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor or assign of the Company, whether the existence of such successor or assign is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participants, Beneficiaries, and their heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.
           . This Plan and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Wisconsin (excluding any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction), except as provided in Section 15.2 hereof.

Section 15.2.
Arbitration
          (a) . Notwithstanding any employee agreement in effect between a Participant and the Company or any Affiliate employer, if a Participant or Beneficiary (the "claimant") brings a claim that relates to benefits under this Plan, regardless of the basis of the claim (including but not limited to, actions under Title VII, wrongful discharge, breach of employment agreement, etc.), such claim shall be settled by final binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Application
 
          (b) . Arbitration must be initiated by serving or mailing a written notice of the complaint to the other party. Normally, such written notice should be provided the other party within one year (365 days) after the day the complaining party first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the complaint. However, this time frame may be extended if the applicable statute of limitation provides for a longer period of time. If the complaint is not properly submitted within the appropriate time frame, all rights and claims that the complaining party has or may have against the other party shall be waived and void. Any notice sent to the Company shall be delivered to:
Initiation of Action
Office of General Counsel Johnson Controls, Inc. 5757 North Green Bay Avenue P.O. Box 591 Milwaukee, WI 53201-0591
          The notice must identify and describe the nature of all complaints asserted and the facts upon which such complaints are based. Notice will be deemed given according to the date of any postmark or the date of time of any personal delivery.
          (c) . Before proceeding to arbitration on a complaint, the claimant must initiate and participate in any complaint resolution procedure identified in the Company's or Affiliate's personnel policies. If the claimant has not initiated the complaint resolution procedure before initiating arbitration on a complaint, the initiation of the arbitration shall be deemed to begin the complaint resolution procedure. No arbitration hearing shall be held on a complaint until any applicable Company or Affiliate complaint resolution procedure has been completed.
Compliance with Personnel Policies
          (d) . All arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator according to the Employment Dispute Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The arbitrator will have authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant including, without limitation, specific performance of any obligation created under policy, the awarding of punitive damages, the issuance of any injunction, costs and attorney's fees to the extent permitted by law, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse of the arbitration process. The arbitrator's award must be rendered in a writing that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's award is based.
Rules of Arbitration
          (e) . Each party may be represented in the arbitration by an attorney or other representative selected by the party. The Company or Affiliate shall be responsible for its own costs, the AAA filing fee and all other fees, costs and expenses of the arbitrator and AAA for administering the arbitration. The claimant shall be responsible for his attorney's or representative's fees, if any. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim which allows the prevailing party costs and/or attorneys' fees, the arbitrator may award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as provided by such statute.
Representation and Costs
          (f) . Discovery will be allowed to the same extent afforded under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Arbitration will be held at a location selected by the Company. AAA rules notwithstanding, the admissibility of evidence
Discovery; Location; Rules of Evidence
 
offered at the arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator who shall be the judge of its materiality and relevance. Legal rules of evidence will not be controlling, and the standard for admissibility of evidence will generally be whether it is the type of information that responsible people rely upon in making important decisions.
          (g) . The existence, content or results of any arbitration may not be disclosed by a party or arbitrator without the prior written consent of both parties. Witnesses who are not a party to the arbitration shall be excluded from the hearing except to testify.
Confidentiality

The Participant will be required to submit such medical evidence or to undergo a medical examination by a doctor selected by the Administrator as the Administrator determines is necessary in order to make a determination hereunder.
 
          . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein includes the feminine, the plural includes the singular, and the singular the plural.
Section 2.2. Gender and Number
          . In the event any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the said illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
Section 2.3. Severability
          . The Administrator shall select the key employees of the Company or an Affiliate for participation in the Plan. No employee shall have any right to receive a Long Term Performance Award in any year even if a Long Term Performance Award has been previously granted in prior years.

Section 3.1. Selection of Participants
          . Until the earlier of the end of a Performance Period or a Participant's termination of employment, the Administrator may at any time withdraw its approval for a Participant's participation in the Plan. In the event of the Administrator's withdrawal of approval, the employee concerned shall cease to be a Participant as of the date selected by the Administrator, the employee's Long Term Performance Award shall be cancelled, and the employee shall not be entitled to any payment under that Long Term Performance Award unless the Administrator determines otherwise. If payment is approved by the Administrator notwithstanding the withdrawal of approval, the payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3, after the end of the Performance Period, and the payment amount shall equal the award amount calculated under Section 5.1, reduced in such manner or by such amount (if at all) as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. A Participant shall be notified of the Administrator's withdrawal of its approval for the Participant's participation in the Plan as soon as practicable following such action.
Section 3.2. Termination of Approval
          .
Section 3.3. Transfers In, Out and Between Eligible Positions
          (a) Notwithstanding Section 3.1, if a key employee is hired or promoted into a position that is eligible for a Long Term Performance Award, the Administrator may (1) select such key employee as a Participant at any time during the course of a Performance Period, (2) take action resulting in a key employee's receipt of an additional Long Term Performance Award, where, with respect to a particular Performance Period already in progress, the key employee is currently a Participant in the Plan and already has a Long Term Performance Award for that Performance Period, or (3) change the Performance Goals, Performance Measures, Performance Scale or potential award amount under a Long Term Performance Award that is already in effect; that the Administrator may not apply the discretion described in clause (3) with regard to any Long Term Performance Award that is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). The Administrator may, but is
provided
 
not required to, prorate the amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant under such Long Term Performance Award had the Participant been employed during the entire Performance Period to reflect the Participant's actual period of employment during the Performance Period.
          (b) If a Participant is demoted during a Performance Period, the Administrator may decrease the potential award amount of any Long Term Performance Award the Participant may be eligible to receive, or revise the Performance Goals, Performance Measures or Performance Scale applicable to the Participant (provided that any such revision as applied to an individual who is a covered employee under Code Section 162(m) may result only in a reduction of the amount that would have otherwise been payable absent such revision), as the Administrator determines is necessary to reflect the Participant's demotion, or the Administrator may withdraw its approval for the Participant's participation in the Plan in accordance with Section 3.2.
          (c) If a Participant is transferred from employment by the Company to the employment of an Affiliate, or vice versa, the Administrator may revise the Participant's Long Term Performance Award to reflect the transfer, including but not limited to, changing the potential award amount, Performance Measures, Performance Goals and Performance Scale applicable to the Participant (provided that any such revision as applied to an individual who is a covered employee under Code Section 162(m) may result only in a reduction of the amount that would have otherwise been payable absent such revision).
          .
Section 3.4. Termination of Employment
          (a) Except as otherwise provided under the terms of an employment or severance agreement between a Participant and the Company, no Participant shall earn an incentive award for a Performance Period unless the Participant is employed by the Company or an Affiliate (or is on an approved leave of absence) on the last day of such Performance Period, unless the Participant's employment was terminated during the year as a result of Retirement, Total and Permanent Disability or death at a time when the Participant could not have been terminated for Cause, or unless payment is approved by the Administrator after considering the cause of the Participant's termination. If payment is approved by the Administrator, the payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3, after the end of the Performance Period, and the payment amount shall equal the award amount calculated under Section 5.1, reduced in such manner or by such amount (if at all) as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.
          (b) If a Participant's employment is terminated as a result of death, Total and Permanent Disability or Retirement, at a time when the Participant could not have been terminated for Cause, then unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate in the event of his or her death) shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (x) the award amount calculated under Section 5.1 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Participant's whole calendar months of employment during the Performance Period for such award and the denominator of which is the number of calendar months in the Performance Period for such award. Payment shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2, subject to Section 5.3.
 
          The Administrator shall determine, at the time a Long Term Performance Award is granted, the Performance Period, the Performance Measure(s), the Performance Goal(s) for such Performance Measure, the Performance Scale (which may vary for different Performance Measures), and the amount payable to the Participant if and to the extent the Performance Goals are met (as measured under the Performance Scale). The amount payable to a Participant for meeting the Performance Goal(s) may be designated as a flat dollar amount or as a percentage of the Participant's Base Salary, or may be determined by any other means specified by the Administrator at the time the Long Term Performance Award is granted.
          . As soon as practicable following the close of a Performance Period, the Administrator shall determine and certify whether and to what extent the Performance Goals and other material terms of the Long Term Performance Award for that Performance Period were satisfied. Based on such certification, the Administrator (or its delegate) shall determine the award amount payable to a Participant under the Long Term Performance Award for that Performance Period, that the maximum award amount for any Participant shall be, with respect to any and all Long Term Performance Awards of such Participant with Performance Periods ending on the last day of, or at any time within, the same fiscal year of the Company, no more than six million dollars ($6,000,000).
Section 5.1. Evaluating Performance and Computing Awards
provided
          . When the payment due to the Participant has been determined, unless otherwise deferred pursuant to a Participant's election under the Company's deferred compensation plan, payment shall be made in a cash lump sum by the 75 day following the close of the Performance Period.
Section 5.2. Timing and Form of Payment
th
          . Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the end of the Performance Period for which a payment for a Long Term Performance Award has accrued, but before payment or deferral of such amount actually occurs, if the Participant engages in Inimical Conduct, or if the Company determines after a Participant's termination of employment that the Participant could have been terminated for Cause, the Long Term Performance Award shall be automatically cancelled and no payment or deferral shall be made. The Administrator may suspend payment or deferral (without liability for interest thereon) pending the Administrator's determination of whether the Participant was or should have been terminated for Cause or whether the Participant has engaged in Inimical Conduct.
Section 5.3. Inimical Conduct
          . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, within thirty (30) days after a Change of Control (as defined below), the Company shall pay each Participant, with respect to each Long Term Performance Award of the
Section 6.1. Acceleration of Payment
 
Participant, a lump sum payment in cash equal to the product of (x) such Participant's maximum potential award amount for the Performance Period(s) in which the Change of Control occurs, as specified in the Performance Award and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days after the first day of the Performance Period on which the Change of Control occurs and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period. If, however, the Participant has a deferral election in effect with respect to any amount payable under this Section 6.1, such amount shall be deferred pursuant to such election and shall not be paid in a lump sum as provided herein.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to amounts payable to a Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate) who is entitled to a payment hereunder because the Participant's employment terminated as a result of death or Disability, or payable to a Participant who has met the requirements for Retirement (without regard to whether the Participant has terminated employment), no payment shall be made unless the Change of Control (as defined below) also constitutes a change of control within the meaning of Code Section 409A.
          . A "Change of Control" means any of the following events:
Section 6.2. Definition of Change of Control
          (a) The acquisition, other than from the Company, by any individual, entity or group of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule l3d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), including in connection with a merger, consolidation or reorganization, of more than either:
, that any acquisition by (x) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (y) any corporation with respect to which, following such acquisition, more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, shall not constitute a Change in Control of the Company; or
provided, however
          (b) Individuals who, as of October 1, 2005, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board during any twelve (12)-month period, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to
provided
 
October 1, 2005, whose election or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board, shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
          (c) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than to a corporation with respect to which, following such sale or disposition, more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, immediately prior to such sale or disposition. For purposes hereof, "a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company" will not be deemed to have occurred if the sale involves assets having a total gross fair market value of less than forty percent (40%) of the total gross fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately prior to the acquisition. For this purpose, "gross fair market value" means the value of the assets without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
          For purposes of this Section 6.2, persons will not be considered to be acting as a "group" solely because they purchase or own stock of the Company at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a "group" if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in the Company and any other corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in such corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the Company.
          In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, then if the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, that such change necessarily or equitably requires an adjustment in the Performance Goals established under a Long Term Performance Award, such adjustments shall be made by the Administrator and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Plan. No adjustment shall be made in connection with the issuance by the Company of any warrants, rights, or options to acquire additional shares of Common Stock or of securities convertible into Common Stock.
 
          If permitted by the Company, a Participant may designate a Beneficiary by filing a beneficiary designation on the form provided by the Administrator. In such event, if the Participant dies prior to receiving any payment due hereunder, such payment shall be made to the Participant's Beneficiary. If, however, the Participant has an effective deferral election in place for such amount under the Company's deferred compensation plan, then the amount shall be deferred and paid in accordance with that plan. A Participant entitled to file a beneficiary designation may change his beneficiary designation at any time, that each beneficiary designation form filed with the Company shall revoke the most recent form on file, and the last form received by the Company while the Participant was alive shall be given effect. In the event there is no valid beneficiary designation form on file, or in the event the Participant's designated Beneficiary is not alive at the time payment is to be made, or in the event a Participant is not entitled to file a beneficiary designation, the Participant's estate will be deemed the Beneficiary and will be entitled to receive payment. If a Participant designates his spouse as a beneficiary, such beneficiary designation automatically shall become null and void on the date of the Participant's divorce or legal separation from such spouse; the Administrator has notice of such divorce or legal separation prior to payment.
provided
provided
          . No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset or assets of the Company (or any Affiliate) by reason of any Long Term Performance Award under the Plan. It is intended that the Company has merely a contractual obligation to make payments when due hereunder and it is not intended that the Company (or any Affiliate) hold any funds in reserve or trust to secure payments hereunder.
Section 9.1. No Funding
          . No Participant may assign, pledge, or encumber his interest under the Plan, or any part thereof, except that a Participant may designate a Beneficiary as provided herein.
Section 9.2. No Transfer
          . Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to:
Section 9.3. No Implied Rights; Employment
          (a) Give any employee or Participant any right to receive any award other than in the sole discretion of the Administrator;
          (b) Limit in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time; or
          (c) Be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that a Participant will be retained in any particular position or at any particular rate of remuneration.
 
          . The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator. If at any time the Committee shall not be in existence, the Board shall assume the Committee's functions and each reference to the Committee herein shall be deemed to include the Board.
Section 10.1. General
          . In addition to the authority specifically provided herein, the Administrator shall have full power and discretionary authority to: (a) administer the Plan, including but not limited to the power and authority to construe and interpret the Plan; (b) correct errors, supply omissions or reconcile inconsistencies in the terms of the Plan or any Long Term Performance Award; (c) establish, amend or waive rules and regulations, and appoint such agents, as it deems appropriate for the Plan's administration; and (d) make any other determinations, including factual determinations, and take any other action as it determines is necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
Section 10.2. Authority
          . The Administrator may delegate to one or more officers of the Company any or all of the authority and responsibility of the Administrator, except that the Committee may not delegate any authority with respect to Long Term Performance Awards that are intended to comply with Code Section 162(m). If the Administrator has made such a delegation, then all references to the Administrator in this Plan include such officer(s) to the extent of such delegation.
Section 10.3. Delegation of Authority
          . The Administrator's determinations and decisions made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and all related orders or resolutions of the Board shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons who have an interest in the Plan or a Long Term Performance Award, and such determinations and decisions shall not be reviewable.
Section 10.4. Decision Binding
          . The Committee's determinations must be made by not less than a majority of its members present at the meeting (in person or otherwise) at which a quorum is present, or by written majority consent, which sets forth the action, is signed by each member of the Committee and filed with the minutes for proceedings of the Committee. A majority of the entire Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Service on the Committee shall constitute service as a director of the Company so that the Committee members shall be entitled to indemnification, limitation of liability and reimbursement of expenses with respect to their Committee services to the same extent that they are entitled under the Company's By-laws and Wisconsin law for their services as directors of the Company.
Section 10.5. Procedures of the Committee
          . The Committee may modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, and may suspend the Plan, and the Employee Benefits Policy Committee (or any successor committee thereto) of the Company may modify or amend the Plan for ministerial or administrative changes or to conform the terms of the Plan to the requirements of applicable law; that, any such amendment or modification shall be
Section 11.1. Amendment
provided
 
approved by the Company's shareholders to the extent required by Code Section 162(m) or other applicable law; that no such modification, amendment, or suspension may, without the consent of the Participant or his or her Beneficiary in the case of the Participant's death, reduce the right of a Participant, or his or her Beneficiary, as the case may be, to any payment due under the Plan except as specifically provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the provisions of Article 6 prior to the effective date of a Change of Control.
provided, however,
          . The Committee may terminate the Plan in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.2. In order for the provisions of this Section 11.2 to apply, the Committee must designate in writing that the Plan is being terminated in accordance with this Section. Upon termination of the Plan, the Committee may provide that all amounts accrued under the Plan to the date of the Plan termination (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) be paid in a lump sum, provided that payments to a Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary or estate) who is entitled to a payment hereunder because the Participant's employment terminated as a result of death or Disability prior to the date of such Plan termination, or amounts payable to a Participant who has met the requirements for Retirement (without regard to whether the Participant has terminated employment) as of the date of such Plan termination may be paid upon termination of the Plan only in the following circumstances:
Section 11.2. Termination
          (a) The Plan is terminated within twelve (12) months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Code Section 331, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(A). In such event, the payment must be paid no later than the latest of: (A) the last day of the calendar year in which the Plan termination occurs, (B) the first calendar year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or (C) the first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.
          (b) The Plan is terminated at any other time, provided that such termination does not occur proximate to a downturn in the financial health of the Company or an Affiliate, and all other plans required to be aggregate with this Plan under Code Section 409A are also terminated and liquidated. In such event, the payment shall be paid no earlier than twelve (12) months (and no later than twenty-four (24) months) after the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment that would otherwise be paid during the twelve (12)-month period beginning on the Plan termination date pursuant to the terms of the Plan shall be paid in accordance with such terms. In addition, the Company or any Affiliate shall be prohibited from adopting a similar arrangement within three (3) years following the date of the Plan's termination
          The Company shall have the right to deduct from all cash payments made hereunder (or from any other payments due a Participant) any foreign, federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such cash payments.
 
          The Company shall have the right to offset from any amount payable hereunder any amount that the Participant owes to the Company or to any Affiliate without the consent of the Participant (or his Beneficiary, in the event of the Participant's death).
          All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Long Term Performance Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor or assign of the Company, whether the existence of such successor or assign is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participants, Beneficiaries, and their heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.
          . This Plan and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Wisconsin (excluding any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction), except as provided in Section 15.2 hereof.
Section 15.1. Governing Law
          .
Section 15.2. Arbitration
          (a) . Notwithstanding any employee agreement in effect between a Participant and the Company or any Affiliate employer, if a Participant or Beneficiary (the "claimant") brings a claim that relates to benefits under this Plan, regardless of the basis of the claim (including but not limited to, actions under Title VII, wrongful discharge, breach of employment agreement, etc.), such claim shall be settled by final binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Application
          (b) . Arbitration must be initiated by serving or mailing a written notice of the complaint to the other party. Normally, such written notice should be provided the other party within one year (365 days) after the day the complaining party first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the complaint. However, this time frame may be extended if the applicable statute of limitation provides for a longer period of time. If the complaint is not properly submitted within the appropriate time frame, all rights and claims that the complaining party has or may have against the other party shall be waived and void. Any notice sent to the Company shall be delivered to:
Initiation of Action
 
          Office of General Counsel           Johnson Controls, Inc.           5757 North Green Bay Avenue           P.O. Box 591           Milwaukee, WI 53201-0591
          The notice must identify and describe the nature of all complaints asserted and the facts upon which such complaints are based. Notice will be deemed given according to the date of any postmark or the date of time of any personal delivery.
          (c) . Before proceeding to arbitration on a complaint, the claimant must initiate and participate in any complaint resolution procedure identified in the Company's or Affiliate's personnel policies. If the claimant has not initiated the complaint resolution procedure before initiating arbitration on a complaint, the initiation of the arbitration shall be deemed to begin the complaint resolution procedure. No arbitration hearing shall be held on a complaint until any applicable Company or Affiliate complaint resolution procedure has been completed.
Compliance with Personnel Policies
          (d) . All arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator according to the Employment Dispute Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The arbitrator will have authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant including, without limitation, specific performance of any obligation created under policy, the awarding of punitive damages, the issuance of any injunction, costs and attorney's fees to the extent permitted by law, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse of the arbitration process. The arbitrator's award must be rendered in a writing that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's award is based.
Rules of Arbitration
          (e) . Each party may be represented in the arbitration by an attorney or other representative selected by the party. The Company or Affiliate shall be responsible for its own costs, the AAA filing fee and all other fees, costs and expenses of the arbitrator and AAA for administering the arbitration. The claimant shall be responsible for his attorney's or representative's fees, if any. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim which allows the prevailing party costs and/or attorneys' fees, the arbitrator may award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as provided by such statute.
Representation and Costs
          (f) . Discovery will be allowed to the same extent afforded under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Arbitration will be held at a location selected by the Company. AAA rules notwithstanding, the admissibility of evidence offered at the arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator who shall be the judge of its materiality and relevance. Legal rules of evidence will not be controlling, and the standard for admissibility of evidence will generally be whether it is the type of information that responsible people rely upon in making important decisions.
Discovery; Location; Rules of Evidence
          (g) . The existence, content or results of any arbitration may not be disclosed by a party or arbitrator without the prior written consent of both parties. Witnesses who are not a party to the arbitration shall be excluded from the hearing except to testify.
