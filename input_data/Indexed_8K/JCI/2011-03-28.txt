Explanatory Note
This current report on Form 8-K/A updates information provided on a Form 8-K dated January 26, 2011, relating to disclosures made under Item 5.07, Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders, associated with the Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on January 26, 2011.
As previously reported, in an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers held at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company on January 26, 2011, 314,207,536 shares voted for one year, 10,009,602 shares voted for two years, 211,952,191 shares voted for three years, and there were 62,828,788 broker non-votes.
SEC regulations state that the Company must hold these votes on frequency at least once every six years. In light of these voting results and other factors, the Company's Board of Directors, at its March 23, 2011 meeting, decided that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company will continue to hold annual advisory votes until the Company's Board of Directors decides to hold the next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
