Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Compensation Plan Changes At a meeting held on September 20, 2011 of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company"), the Committee approved the following amendments to the Companys 2001 Restricted Stock Plan and 2007 Stock Option Plan, all of which were effective immediately: The 2001 Restricted Stock Plan was amended to provide that only shares of Company stock issued pursuant to awards under the plan reduce the number of shares available under the plan. Because restricted share unit (RSU) awards are only settled in cash, the effect of the amendment is that RSU awards do not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. The 2007 Stock Option Plan was amended to provide that stock appreciation rights (SARs) under the plan that are settled in cash do not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. The 2001 Restricted Stock Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan were amended to give the Committee the authority to approve a definition of "retirement" at the time it grants an equity award that is different from the definition that the respective plan provides. Except for these amendments, the 2001 Restricted Stock Plan remains in all material respects as described in the Companys proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 4, 2003. Except for these amendments, the 2007 Stock Option Plan remains in all material respects as described in the Companys proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2006.
