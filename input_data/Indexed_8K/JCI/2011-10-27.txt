Business results (excluding items, see Footnotes)
Automotive Experience
Automotive Experience sales in the quarter increased 24% to $5.1 billion versus $4.1 billion last year due to higher global production volumes, incremental volume from recent acquisitions, new program launches and a favorable foreign currency impact. North American revenues increased 7% to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion last year, approximately equal to the increase in industry vehicle production levels. European sales were significantly higher than the 2010 fourth quarter at $2.6 billion due to higher production volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, revenue growth in Europe totaled 26%, compared with an industry production increase of 5%, led by higher volumes for BMW, Renault/PSA, and Volkswagen. In Asia, sales increased 15% to $650 million from $563 million in 2010 due to higher demand in Korea. China revenues, which are mostly generated through unconsolidated joint ventures, rose 20% to $1.1 billion, compared to an 8% increased in auto production in the quarter. The company said its automotive joint ventures in China generated more than $4.0 billion in revenues in fiscal 2011.
Johnson Controls recently announced that its 2012  2014 backlog of net new business increased to $4.2 billion, compared with a backlog of $4.0 billion for 2011  2013.
Automotive Experience segment income totaled $234 million in the current quarter, up 81% compared with $129 million last year, as a result of the higher volumes and improved profitability in Europe and at its Chinese joint ventures. European segment income was $74 million compared with a loss in the 2010 quarter, while segment income in Asia more than doubled year-over-year. North America segment income was down 16% due to higher engineering expenses and production launch costs associated with the opening of a new metals component facility.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 19% to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion last year, reflecting higher volumes in Europe and Asia as well as higher lead prices, which are passed along to customers. Excluding the lead impact, sales rose 12% versus the same period last year. Aftermarket unit shipments increased 4%. Higher global automotive production resulted in a 2% increase in original equipment battery shipments worldwide.
Power Solutions segment income was $213 million, up 17% versus $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the higher volumes, a favorable product mix and the benefits of increased vertical integration.
In the fourth quarter, the company said it would invest $100 million to build AGM battery capacity associated with start-stop vehicle production in China. The plant is expected to launch production in early 2013. Also in the fourth quarter, Johnson Controls acquired the share of its hybrid battery joint venture partner for approximately $145 million in cash and announced four new lithium-ion battery supply contracts with Azure Dynamics, Geely, Land Rover, and Odyne.

Building Efficiency
Building Efficiency sales in the 2011 fourth quarter were $4.1 billion, up 14% compared with last year. All five segments of Building Efficiency increased revenues versus the prior year, led by Global Workplace Solutions (up 24%) and Asia (up 17%). Market share gains led to a 19% increase in shipments of small and large tonnage chillers globally, reflecting growth in all geographic regions, with double-digit increases in North America and Asia. Fourth quarter backlog increased 8% to a record $5.1 billion versus $4.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, with the largest gains in Asia and Latin America. Orders were level with last year as an 18% increase in Asia was offset by lower orders in the Middle East and North America Service. The company noted that in the 2010 quarter, Middle East orders included the company's largest-ever contract for HVAC equipment.
Segment income of $278 million was up 1% compared with last year as double-digit improvements in North America Systems (+13%), Asia (+27%) and in the Middle East ("Other" segment +34%) were offset by lower segment income in North America Service and Global Workplace Solutions. The lower North America Service results are related to Solutions contract reserves, acquisition-related costs and investments in infrastructure. Global Workplace Solutions profitability was impacted by costs associated with recent contract launches, which totaled approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2011. Excluding the Global Workplace Solutions business, segment margin in the quarter was 9.3%.
In October, Johnson Controls introduced the Panoptix solution, an industry-first next-generation building efficiency system. The Panoptix solution integrates multiple systems and activities across building portfolios, resulting in enhanced performance and greater operational efficiencies.
Full-year results (excluding items)
For the 2011 fiscal year, Johnson Controls sales increased 19% to $40.8 billion compared with $34.3 billion in 2010. Income from business segments increased to $2.4 billion from $1.9 billion the prior year. Net income increased 22% percent to $1.7 billion from $1.4 billion in 2010. Further details of the fiscal 2011 financial results are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
2012 Outlook
Johnson Controls today affirmed the 2012 financial guidance it issued on October 12, 2011. Johnson Controls anticipates a sales increase of 8%, to approximately $44.2 billion. The 2012 expectations are the result of modestly higher global automotive production levels, growth across the businesses in emerging markets as well as market share gains. Earnings are forecast to increase to approximately $2.85 - $3.00 per diluted share. Sales, earnings and margin improvements are expected in all three of its businesses in 2012.

"We are optimistic as we begin fiscal 2012. We have good momentum resulting from the strong backlogs in our automotive and buildings businesses, our market leadership position in new battery technologies and continued growth opportunities in emerging geographic markets," said Mr. Roell. "Our long-term objective is to profitably grow faster than our underlying industries and we will make record levels of investment in 2012 to support that goal. We have the strategies and processes in place to improve our profitability. With the support of our customers and employees around the world, I am confident that 2012 will be another record year for Johnson Controls."
