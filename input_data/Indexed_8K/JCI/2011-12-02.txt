On December 2, 2011, Johnson Controls, Inc. (the "Company") closed its sale of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.600% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes"), $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.750% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% Senior Notes due 2041 (the "2041 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated November 29, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, as well as indemnification rights and obligations of the parties.
The Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement were registered under the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157502) filed on February 24, 2009 (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of January 17, 2006, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association as successor Trustee, and pursuant to an Officers' Certificate, dated December 2, 2011 (the "Officers' Certificate"), setting forth the terms of the Notes. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $1.09 billion, after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
The relevant terms of the Notes are set forth in the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate. The Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after expiration of any applicable grace period.
The Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a "make-whole" redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time on or after September 1, 2021 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 2021 Notes), with respect to the 2021 Notes, or June 1, 2041 (six months prior to the maturity date of the 2041 Notes), with respect to the 2041 Notes, the Company may redeem some or all of the applicable series of Notes at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change in control triggering event as defined in the Officers' Certificate, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, and the Officers' Certificate (including the terms of the Notes) set forth above are qualified in their entirety by the terms of such agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement, and Exhibit 4.1 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with its filing with the SEC of a final prospectus supplement, dated November 29, 2011, and a prospectus, dated February 23, 2009, related to the offering of the Notes.

The Company will file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) a final supplement to the form of prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall include all information required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be included therein with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to the Representatives prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised the Representatives, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein.

Agreements of the Company
(a) During the period beginning with the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date as, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Final Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with the initial offering or sale of the Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless, in each case, the Company has furnished the Representatives a copy for their review prior to such time, and the Company will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filings.
 
(b) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rules 424(b) and 433, respectively, (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof, including, if necessary, and subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(c) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, as set forth in Schedule IV hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
(d) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event occurs as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of such event or, in circumstances where the Company's obligations under this paragraph (d) arise from an opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, notify the Representatives of such event after the Company receives such opinion, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment to the Registration Statement, a new registration statement or an amendment or supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representatives in such quantities as may be reasonably requested.
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the date hereof and otherwise satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158).
 
(f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(g) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities (provided that the Company will not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now subject), will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in connection with its review of the offering.
(h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for printing and engraving fees, for fees charged by the Trustee, for the expenses, if any, incurred by the Underwriters in road shows, for any filing fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority relating to the Securities and for expenses incurred in printing and distributing the Final Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectuses and any supplements thereto to the Underwriters. The Company will pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
(i) During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, prepare, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus where, as a result of such preparation, use, authorization, approval or reference, the Company would be required to file the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission or retain the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus under Rule 433 and the Company will not file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus with the Commission (other than the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto, any electronic road show and any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package). Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (ii) it will comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
(j) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Closing Date.
(k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
(l) The Company will retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433.
(m) The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
5. . Each Underwriter agrees with the Company that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any Free Writing Prospectus (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III, any electronic road show or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus prepared pursuant to Section 4(i) above or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Schedule IV hereto without the consent of the Company.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, the percentage in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingDiscounts and Commissions" relating to concessions and the second sentence in the first paragraph under the heading "UnderwritingPrice Stabilization and Short Positions" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8 that the indemnifying party may designate in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii)
provided
however
 
the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company
provided
however
 
shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). For the avoidance of doubt, the contribution obligations of the Underwriters under this paragraph (d) are several and not joint.
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred (1) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, act of terrorism, attack on the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or (2) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls, and, with respect to either (1) or (2) above, the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
Patriot Act Compliance
15. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
No Fiduciary Duty
16. . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to [        ], or registered assignees, the principal sum set forth in the Schedule of Transfers and Exchanges in Note attached hereto, which amount shall not exceed Four Hundred Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($450,000,000) on December 1, 2021, and to pay interest thereon from December 2, 2011, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2012, at the rate of 3.750% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 3.750% Note Due 2021 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the May 15 or November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice
 
whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated herein issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: December 2, 2011
 
 
Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of January 17, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Base Indenture) to which Base Indenture, together with all indentures supplemental to the Base Indenture and the Officers' Certificates under Section 3.01 of the Base Indenture setting forth the form and terms of the Notes (the Base Indenture as so supplemented, "the Indenture"), reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time prior to September 1, 2021 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes). The Redemption Price for the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 25 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
In addition, at any time on or after September 1, 2021 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at its option, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
 
For the purposes of determining the Redemption Price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of Debt Securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (or their respective affiliates that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers); provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, (2) one Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Banca IMI S.p.A. or its successor and (3) one Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. or its successor. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of such Holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including the date of purchase, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due and owing on the relevant Interest Payment Date. The Change of Control Offer will be made in accordance with the terms specified in the Indenture.
With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the time or terms of payment of the principal at maturity of, or the interest on, any such series of Debt Securities, or reduce principal or premium or the rate of interest, without the consent of the Holder thereof, or (b) without the consent of all of the
 
Holders of any series of Debt Securities then outstanding, reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any such series, the Holders of which are required to consent (i) to any such supplemental indenture, (ii) to rescind and annul a declaration that the Debt Securities of any series are due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (iii) to waive any past Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences and (iv) to waive compliance with certain other provisions contained in the Indenture.
The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture.
The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Debt Security Registrar (initially U.S. Bank National Association) in the registry books maintained by such Debt Security Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name a Note is registered as the owner for all purposes whether or not such Note be overdue and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
 
This Note is in the form of a Global Security as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Global Security representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Indenture, any supplemental indenture, or of any Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect thereof shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any Subsidiary or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liabilities being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Notes are subject to defeasance at the option of the Company as provided in the Indenture.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that the Securities, when delivered by the Company in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
