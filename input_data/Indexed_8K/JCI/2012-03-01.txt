The Company shall assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability or claim, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person and the payment of all expenses. The Remarketing Agent or such controlling person against whom such suit is brought shall have the right to employ one separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Remarketing Agent or the expense of such controlling person unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Company or (ii) the named parties to any such suit (including any impleaded parties) include the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person and the Company and the Remarketing Agent or such controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on the behalf of the Remarketing Agent or on the behalf of such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any required local counsel) for the Remarketing Agent and such controlling persons, which firm (and local counsel, if any) shall be designated in writing by the Remarketing Agent.

The Remarketing Agent's agreement to indemnify the Company and any other indemnified person as aforesaid is expressly conditioned upon the Remarketing Agent being notified of the action in connection therewith brought against the Company or any other indemnified person by letter, telegram, or facsimile transmission addressed to it at its address furnished to the Company for the purpose, with reasonable promptness after the first legal process which discloses the nature of the liability or claim shall have been served upon the Company or any other indemnified person (or after the Company or any such person shall have received notice of such service on any agent designated by the Company or any such person), but failure so to notify the Remarketing Agent shall not relieve the Remarketing Agent from any liability which it may have to the Company or any other indemnified person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.
The Remarketing Agent shall assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such liability or claim, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Company or such other person and the payment of all expenses. The Company or other indemnified person against whom such suit is brought shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company or such other indemnified person unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Remarketing Agent or (ii) the named parties to any suit (including any impleaded parties) include the Company or such other indemnified person and the Remarketing Agent, and the Company or such other indemnified person shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Remarketing Agent, in which case the Remarketing Agent shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the Company or such other indemnified person, it being understood, however, that the Remarketing Agent shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any required local counsel) for the Company and such person, which firm (and local counsel, if any) shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Remarketing Agent shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Remarketing Agent from all liability arising out of such loss, expense, liability or claim.
 
(a) If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) and 7(b) above for any reason other than as specified therein in respect of any losses, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the remarketing of the Remarketed Notes; or (ii) if the allocation provided in clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) to the Company from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Notes bears to the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any claim or action.
(b) The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages that the Remarketing Agent have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 7 and Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent; provided, however, that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
The Remarketing Agent, when acting as the Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (collectively, the ""). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

Securities

No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein.

Johnson Controls, Inc.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Johnson Controls, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-179613) (the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated February 22, 2012, and the final supplement to the prospectus, dated February 27, 2012 (collectively, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the remarketing of the Company's 11.50% Subordinated Notes due 2042 (CUSIP 478366 AT4), which series will be designated the Company's 2.355% Senior Notes due 2017 (CUSIP 478373 AA1) following the Remarketing (each, a "Remarketed Note," and collectively, the "Remarketed Notes"). Following the Remarketing, the Remarketed Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March 16, 2009, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of March 16, 2009, and the Supplemental Indenture No. 2, dated as of the date hereof (such Indenture, as amended and supplemented, the "Indenture"), in each case between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
As counsel to the Company in connection with the remarketing of the Remarketed Notes, we have examined or are otherwise familiar with (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company; (ii) the By-Laws of the Company, as amended to date; (iii) the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus and exhibits (including those incorporated by reference) constituting a part of the Registration Statement; (iv) the Indenture; and (v) such other documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us to render this opinion.
In our examination of the above-referenced documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, assuming that (i) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee and (ii) the Notes have been duly authenticated by the Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that the Securities, when delivered by the Company in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by
 
Johnson Controls, Inc.

the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be legally issued and valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
We hereby consent to the deemed incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and to the reference to our firm therein. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
