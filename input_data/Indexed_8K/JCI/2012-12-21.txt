FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MILWAUKEE, December 19, 2012  Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE: JCI), a global diversified company in the building and automotive industries, announced today that it expects to post higher sales and earnings in fiscal 2013 despite a challenging economic environment.
The Company is presenting its fiscal 2013 forecast to financial analysts today in New York. Highlights include:
 
 
 
 
 
From a market perspective, Johnson Controls said that compared with 2012 markets, it expects slightly higher 2013 automotive production in North America and China with lower production in Europe. Global non-residential construction spending is forecast to be relatively flat in 2013 as strength in emerging markets, especially Asia, offsets anticipated softness in North America and Europe.
The Company said it believes it is positioned to grow faster than its underlying markets with improved profitability over the long term.
"While we recognize the challenges of the near-term global economy, we believe our unique strengths will enable Johnson Controls to outperform our underlying markets. We have added management capacity and depth with talent from outside JCI to further leverage of our competitive advantages," said Stephen A. Roell, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson Controls. "The company continues to benefit from growth opportunities stemming from our investments in technology and
Exhibit 99.1
 
global expansion. We remain committed to investing for future growth and profit improvement and are confident that our 2013 strategies and improvement initiatives position us to improve shareholder value over the long term."
2013 Business Segment Financial Outlook
Johnson Controls provided sales and margin guidance for each of its four business units in 2013.
Automotive Seating 2013 sales are forecast to gain approximately 2 percent, reflecting higher production volumes in North America, partially offset by the lower production environment in Europe. Segment margins are expected to be approximately 4.2 to 4.4 percent in 2013 as the negative impact of lower European production offsets improvements in operational efficiency and the benefits from recent cost reduction initiatives.
Automotive Electronics and Interiors 2013 sales are projected to increase approximately 2 percent, reflecting higher volumes in Asia, partially offset by lower electronics sales in Europe. Operating leverage and operational improvements, offset by investment in electronics product development are forecast to result in margins of approximately 1.9 to 2.1 percent in 2013.
The combined automotive backlog for 2013 to 2015 is $3.7 billion, approximately level with the 2012 to 2014 period due to a lower assumed auto production rate in Europe.
Power Solutions 2013 sales are estimated to increase approximately 10 to 12 percent due to higher battery volumes across all regions and channels, led by higher production in China, market share growth and increasing market demand for AGM batteries which are used in Start-Stop vehicles. Segment margins are expected to be approximately 14.6 to 14.8 percent in 2013 led by operating leverage, an improved product mix and continued operational improvements, offset by lead recoveries.
Building Efficiency sales are forecast to increase 2 to 4 percent in 2013 due to growth in emerging markets and a moderate recovery in North America Systems and Service. Segment margins are expected to increase approximately 50 basis points to 6.4 to 6.5 percent in 2013, due to improved operating leverage, pricing actions and the benefits of earlier cost reduction initiatives.
Johnson Controls expects to make capital investments of $1.4 billion in 2013 vs. $1.8 billion in 2012. Approximately 80% of the company's capital expenditures in 2013 are associated with growth and margin expansion opportunities. The higher capital expenditures focus on increased manufacturing capacity for AGM batteries and on expansion in emerging markets. The increased investments also will support a higher level of Automotive Experience new business launches in 2013.
Mid-Term Financial Outlook (Through 2017)
Today, Johnson Controls also provided mid-term margin guidance for each of its four businesses.
Exhibit 99.1
 
Automotive Seating forecasts annual margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points due to benefits from vertical integration, operational improvements and better quoting disciplines. Longer-term, the company believes margins could improve to 7 to 8 percent.
Annual margin expansion of 60 to 70 basis points over the mid-term is projected for Automotive Electronics and Interiors driven by higher profitability in Electronics, an operational turnaround in Interiors and cost improvement initiatives. Over the next few years, margin could increase to 4 to 6 percent.
Power Solutions forecasts 200 basis points of margin expansion by 2017 led by an improved product mix, manufacturing improvements, and benefits from vertical integration.
Building Efficiency expects annual margin expansion of approximately 40 to 50 basis points due to improved supply chain management, business model changes, and growth in emerging markets.
The Strategic Review and 2013 Outlook Meeting begins at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A webcast of the event and presentation materials are available in the "Investors" section of .

But innovation is no more than table stakes to play winning in this industry requires cost leadership
Innovations don't earn consistent premium.
Our customers are cost driven and that will not change
Price is the main driver of winning business
They work to develop product offerings from competitors that can effectively substitute with similar look and feel or equivalent functionally
Innovations are rapidly copied
And customers facilitate innovation transfer across suppliers
As a result, no competitor can expect to earn a consistent premium from innovation
making it a cost game
Lowest total cost positions are derived from: The right designs at the right costs The right production model The right manufacturing and sourcing footprint The right supply base anchored by appropriate supplier relationships Effective, efficient and repeatable operations Strong processes JCMS, SDT and S&OP

Much of our current business is in good shape
North America Interiors:
While earning reasonable returns today, we are undertaking restructuring actions to improve returns to our desired rates
Asia Interiors:
Has historically earned strong returns; need to continue to drive efficiencies to maintain margins while growing business
Electronics:
Very strong returns especially in North America; focused on growing the business to an at scale position
Restructuring two plants and dense packing
Fixing a few under performing plants
Lowering SG&A
Moving to a different purchasing model
Expanding our Southern US and Mexican footprint
Solid returns on all our Joint Ventures
Facing near term margin pressure due to launch costs
We need to protect profit margins:
Change LTA expectations in a slowing market
Thoughtful vertical integration to enhance margins
Grow the core Driver Information business
Establish a solid position in the Infotainment market
Expand the Specialty Products portfolio
Accelerate our growth in China and India
Build a globally competitive footprint

but some programs are not, particularly in Europe. The worst performing programs are a profit problem and we are focused on fixing them
Program 1
Loses $9 million per year
Program 2
Loses $19 million per year
Program 3
Will lose $11 million per year
Program 4
Increased engineering costs
Program 5
Loses $8 million per year
We have rights to cancel our contract and have initiated this process
Customer requesting higher volumes than contractually agreed
We are working with the customer to resolve and improving our scrap issues
Program bid and won based on supply from one plant, but was switched to another plant to resolve a labor dispute
We have four initiatives to improve this program
Launch issues with a electronic design
Fixes are being worked and accepted by the customer
We are cost disadvantaged relative to market price
We are working to have the program re sourced
12
 
We also need to restructure Interiors in Europe
Taking near term actions to address volume reductions
Western European FY'13 volume forecast to be more than 8% lower than FY'11
Further exacerbating issues with excess industry capacity
We have taken one wave of restructuring actions and are in the process of a second wave
In total, we expect to achieve $27 M in run rate savings as a result of these actions
