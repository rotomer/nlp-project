SECTION 1.02. Classification of Loans and Borrowings. For purposes of this Agreement, Loans may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a "Revolving Loan") or by Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Loan") or by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Revolving Loan"). Borrowings also may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a "Revolving Borrowing") or by Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Borrowing") or by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing"). SECTION 1.03. Terms Generally. The definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words "include", "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". Unless the context requires otherwise (a) any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements or modifications set forth herein), (b) any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Person's successors and assigns, (c) the words "herein", "hereof" and "hereunder", and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof, (d) all references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement and (e) the words "asset" and "property" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets and properties, including cash, securities, accounts and contract rights. SECTION 1.04. Accounting Terms; GAAP. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that, if Holdings or the Parent Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that Holdings or the Parent Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof to
30 eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies Holdings or the Parent Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith. It is understood that all financial computations hereunder with respect to Holdings and the Subsidiaries (including computations of Consolidated EBITDA and Net Tangible Assets and compliance with Section 6.07) shall be made excluding the accounts of all Excluded Subsidiaries. ARTICLE II The Credits SECTION 2.01. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's Commitment or (b) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required. (b) Subject to Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the applicable Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar
31 Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 12 Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings outstanding. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date. SECTION 2.03. Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a Revolving Borrowing, a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice given by the Parent Borrower of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the relevant Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
32 (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and (v) the location and number of the relevant Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06. If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lenders agree to make Swingline Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $75,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Commitments; provided that no Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. (b) To request a Swingline Loan, a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Swingline Lender of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which
33 shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The applicable Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the relevant Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of such Borrower with such Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. (c) A Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from a Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan of such Borrower after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
34 Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. (d) The Parent Borrower may designate any Lender to be a Swingline Lender hereunder subject to the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender. Any such designation shall not be effective until confirmed in a written agreement signed by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) any Account Party may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, and (ii) the Issuing Banks agree to issue Letters of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by an Account Party to, or entered into by an Account Party with, any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), an Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the
35 beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the applicable Account Party shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments. Each Issuing Bank shall provide to the LC Agent and the Administrative Agent not later than 3:00 p.m. (or promptly thereafter, if unable to do so by 3:00 p.m.), New York City time, on the first Business Day of each calendar week a report of such Issuing Bank setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank that are outstanding as of 3:00 p.m. on the last Business Day of the preceding calendar week, (ii) the average daily undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for each calendar day during the period since the last calendar day covered by the preceding weekly report (or, in the case of the first weekly report, during the period from and including the Effective Date) and (iii) the aggregate amount of LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed as of the time of such report. In addition to providing such weekly reports, each Issuing Bank shall, from time to time upon request of the LC Agent or the Administrative Agent, provide the LC Agent and the Administrative Agent with information of the type referred to in the immediately preceding sentence on a more frequent basis. The LC Agent shall provide to each Lender not later than 3:00 p.m. (or promptly thereafter, if unable to do so by 3:00 p.m.), New York City time, on the first Business Day of each calendar month a report setting forth the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit that are outstanding as of the date of the most recent weekly reports delivered by the Issuing Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding paragraph. Neither the LC Agent nor the Administrative Agent nor any Issuing Bank shall have any duty or obligation at any time to monitor the LC Exposure relative to the total Commitments and neither the LC Agent nor the Administrative
36 Agent nor any Issuing Bank shall have any liability in respect of the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit to the extent that such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension results in the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Commitments. It shall be the responsibility of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to ensure that, after giving effect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed the total Commitments. (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank in respect of such Letter of Credit hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Account Party on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to an Account Party for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, (i) the applicable Account Party shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Account Party shall have received notice of such LC
37 Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Account Party prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (A) the Business Day that such Account Party receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (B) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Account Party receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $10,000,000, the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing by the Parent Borrower or a Swingline Loan to the Parent Borrower in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Account Party's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan; or (ii) such Issuing Bank may, if arrangements to do so have been agreed upon in writing by the Parent Borrower, a Borrowing Subsidiary or an Account Party and such Issuing Bank, obtain reimbursement of such LC Disbursement by debiting directly from an account of the Parent Borrower, such Borrowing Subsidiary or such Account Party maintained with such Issuing Bank (or one of its Affiliates) an amount equal to such LC Disbursement; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to prevent the applicable Account Party from reimbursing LC Disbursements of an Issuing Bank in accordance with alternate procedures agreed upon with such Issuing Bank, so long as such reimbursements are made no later than required under clause (i) above. If such Account Party fails to make such payment when due or the applicable Issuing Bank is unable to debit the designated account of the Parent Borrower, the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary or the relevant Account Party for the full amount of the LC Disbursement, in each case as provided in the preceding sentence, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the LC Agent (and upon receipt of such notice the LC Agent shall notify each Lender and the Administrative Agent) of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Account Party in respect thereof and (in the case of such notice from the LC Agent to each Lender) such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from such Account Party (the "Participation Amount"), in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and
38 the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from such Account Party pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve such Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. (f) Obligations Absolute. An Account Party's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Account Party's obligations hereunder. Neither the LC Agent, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing Bank from
39 liability to the applicable Account Party to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by such Account Party to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Account Party that are caused by the applicable Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) or such other standard of care as shall be separately agreed to in writing by such Issuing Bank and the applicable Account Party, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the LC Agent, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Account Party by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), or by such other means of communication (if any) as have been agreed upon by such Account Party and such Issuing Bank, of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Account Party shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Account Party reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
40 Revolving Loans; provided that, if such Account Party fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (i) Designation and Replacement of Issuing Banks. An Account Party may designate any Lender to be an Issuing Bank hereunder, subject to such Lender's agreement, in its sole discretion, to become an Issuing Bank. Such Account Party shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such designation. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the applicable Account Party, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank (which must be a Lender). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Account Party shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (j) Cash Collateralization. If (i) the Administrative Agent has declared the Loans outstanding hereunder due and payable pursuant to Article VII and (ii) the Liens on the Collateral have been released pursuant to Section 9.02(c), then, on the Business Day that an Account Party receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, such Account Party shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date
41 attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Account Party plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to Holdings, any Borrower or any Account Party described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of such Account Party under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at such Account Party's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Account Party for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of such Account Party for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy the other Obligations. SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of
42 any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing (or, in respect of the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement under Section 2.05(e), such Lender's Participation Amount), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share (or such Lender's Participation Amount, as applicable) available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing (or such Lender's Participation Amount, as applicable) available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower (or such Issuing Bank, as applicable) to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If (x) with respect to such Borrowing, such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing or (y) with respect to such reimbursement of such LC Disbursement, the applicable Account Party shall reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement before the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank reimburses the Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, then the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive or retain the amount due to it as provided above together with interest payable by such Account Party with respect to the period commencing on the date that the Administrative Agent funded its payment to the applicable Issuing Bank. SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Such Borrower may elect different
43 options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by such Borrower. (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
44 (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase in Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. (b) The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments. (c) The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or
45 prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. (d) The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, request that the Commitments be increased by an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500,000,000. Each such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in the Commitments and the date (the "Proposed Effective Date") on which such increase is requested to become effective (which date shall not be less than 60 days after the date of such notice) and shall offer each Lender the opportunity to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of the proposed increase in the amount of the total Commitments. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not less than 30 days prior to the Proposed Effective Date, either agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing to increase its Commitment being referred to herein as an "Increasing Lender") or decline to increase its Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment)(each Lender so declining or deemed to have declined being referred to herein as a "Non-Increasing Lender"). In the event that, on the 30th day prior to the Proposed Effective Date, the Lenders have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the total Commitments requested by the Parent Borrower, the Parent Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution being referred to herein as an "Augmenting Lender"), which may (but need not) include any Lender, to extend Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount of such Commitments; provided that (i) each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) each Borrower, each Account Party and each applicable Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence its Commitment and its status as a Lender. Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the Proposed Effective Date and the Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the
46 foregoing, no increase in the total Commitments shall become effective under this paragraph unless (i) on the Proposed Effective Date, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of Holdings or the Parent Borrower and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents reasonably satisfactory to it consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. (e) On the effective date (a "Increase Effective Date") of any increase in the total Commitments pursuant to paragraph (d) above (each a "Commitment Increase"), (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding (the "Initial Loans") immediately prior to giving effect to such Commitment Increase on the related Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender that shall have been a Lender prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (I) such Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and the deemed payment of the Initial Loans, but prior to the making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) multiplied by (II) the amount of the related Subsequent Borrowings and (B) the product of (I) such Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase, the deemed payment of the Initial Loans and the making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) multiplied by (II) the amount of such Initial Loans, (iii) each Augmenting Lender that shall not have been a Lender prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (A) such Augmenting Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and the deemed payment of the Initial Loans, but prior to the making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) multiplied by (B) the amount of the related Subsequent Borrowings, and (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Non-Increasing Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference between (A) the product of (I) such Non-Increasing Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase, the
47 deemed payment of the Initial Loans and the making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) multiplied by (II) the amount of such Initial Loans, and (B) the product of (I) such Non-Increasing Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and the deemed payment of the Initial Loans, but prior to the making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) multiplied by (II) the amount of the related Subsequent Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of such Commitment Increase, each Borrower shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the "Subsequent Borrowings") pursuant to Section 2.02 in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Initial Loans owed by such Borrower and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (vi) each Non-Increasing Lender, each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each related Subsequent Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and the deemed payment of the Initial Loans, but prior to the deemed making of the related Subsequent Borrowings) and (vii) the relevant Borrower shall pay each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on such Initial Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the relevant Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto. SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan owed by such Borrower to such Lender on the Maturity Date and (ii) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan owed to such Swingline Lender by such Borrower on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Borrower then outstanding. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
48 principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay its Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any of its Borrowings in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (b) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the maximum amount of Revolving Credit Exposures permitted by Section 6.08, the Borrowers shall prepay Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, each Account Party shall deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
49 (c) The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12. SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, the Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposures of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purposes).
50 (b) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in (A) Stand-by Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate, and (B) Trade Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal to 50% of the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the determination date, in each case on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum, on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure in respect of Stand-by Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (c) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the
51 Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower or any Account Party hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
52 Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) Subject to Section 2.18, if any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any
53 Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender and the relevant Account Party will pay to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered in accordance with Section 2.18. (b) Subject to Section 2.18, if any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender and the relevant Account Party will pay to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered in accordance with Section 2.18. (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender and the relevant Account Party shall pay such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate (such amount hereinafter referred to as the "Additional Costs") within 30 days after receipt thereof. (d) Subject to Section 2.18, failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
54 waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation. SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) If any Borrower or any Account Party shall be required by reason of any change occurring after the date of this Agreement in applicable law or regulation or tax treaty or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable by such Borrower or such
55 Account Party (as the case may be) hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Issuing Bank, any Lender or to the Administrative Agent, then except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.16 and subject to Section 2.18, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrowers and the Account Parties agree to pay any present or future Other Taxes which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any other Loan Document or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any such Loan Document other than any Other Taxes imposed upon any assignment or participation of a Lender's rights, interests and obligations hereunder or thereunder; provided that the amount such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) shall be required to pay to a particular Lender in respect of Other Taxes shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate amount of the Commitment of such Lender on which such Other Taxes are imposed; provided further that if a Lender is actually aware of the application of any Other Tax to any such payment, execution, delivery or registration, such Lender shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower of such Other Tax and the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall thereafter have the benefit of the provisions of Section 2.18(b). (c) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes withheld by the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) in respect of any payment to any Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent, such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or, if such a receipt is not available, a certificate of the treasurer or any assistant treasurer of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) setting forth the amount of such payment and the date on which such payment was made.
56 (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.16 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans made hereunder and reimbursement obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit issued hereunder. (e) On the date hereof (or, in the case of an entity that becomes an Issuing Bank or a Lender after the date hereof, on the date such entity becomes an Issuing Bank or a Lender) and thereafter as required by applicable law, each Issuing Bank and Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent such certificates, documents or other evidence, and any amendments or supplements to such certificates, documents, or other evidence, as required by the Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Issuing Bank or Lender (or the Administrative Agent) establishing that payments made under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document to such Issuing Bank or Lender (or the Administrative Agent) are (i) not subject to withholding under the Code because such payments are effectively connected with the conduct by such Issuing Bank or Lender (or the Administrative Agent) of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) totally exempt from United States tax under a provision of an applicable tax treaty. Unless the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to Taxes or are subject to Taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrowers and the Account Parties shall withhold Taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Issuing Bank or Lender (or to the Administrative Agent) organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States. (f) Neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be required to pay any additional amounts to any Issuing Bank or Lender (or to the Administrative Agent) pursuant to paragraph (a) above if the obligations to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Issuing Bank or Lender (or the Administrative Agent) to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) unless such failure results from a change occurring after the date of this Agreement in applicable law or regulations or tax treaty or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
57 with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law). (g) Neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be liable under this Section 2.16 to any Issuing Bank, Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, that has changed the location of its principal office or any of its Applicable Lending Offices after the date (the "Relevant Date") on which it first becomes a party to this Agreement (a "Change in Location") for any Taxes that would have not been imposed but for a Change in Law enacted, promulgated, or effective before the Relevant Date, but only to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) was required to pay such Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.16 immediately prior to such Change in Location. (h) If any Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of Taxes indemnified and paid by a Borrower or an Account Party, such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Parent Borrower, apply for such refund at the Parent Borrower's expense. If any Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any Taxes for which such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent has received payment from a Borrower or an Account Party hereunder, it shall within 30 days after the receipt thereof repay the lesser of such refund and the amount paid by such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) with respect to such Taxes to the applicable Borrower or the applicable Account Party, as applicable, in each case net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent and with interest received by such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent from the relevant taxing authority attributable to such refund; provided that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be), upon the request of such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, agree to return any such refund (plus interest, penalties and other charges) to such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, in the event such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to pay such refund to any Governmental Authority. (i) Each Issuing Bank, Lender, and the Administrative Agent severally (but not jointly) represents
58 and warrants that, as of the date such person becomes a party to this Agreement, payments made by the Borrowers and the Account Parties to such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement are effectively connected with the conduct by such Issuing Bank, Lender or the Administrative Agent of a trade or business in the United States. SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower and each Account Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due), in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or a Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
59 (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower or any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower or an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent from such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) has made such payment on such date in
60 accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If, with respect to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, an event or circumstance occurs that would entitle such Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise any of the rights or benefits afforded by Section 2.14 or 2.16(a), such Lender or the Administrative Agent, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall take all steps as may be reasonably available (including designating a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or participating in Letters of Credit or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, or furnishing the proper certificates under any applicable tax laws, tax treaties, conventions and governmental regulations to the extent that such certificates are legally available to such Lender or to the Administrative Agent) to eliminate or mitigate the effects of any event resulting in the ability of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise rights under any of such Sections; provided that neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be under any obligation to take any step that, in its reasonable judgment, would (i) result in its incurring Additional Costs or Taxes in performing its obligations hereunder unless the Borrowers and the Account Parties have expressly agreed to reimburse it therefor or (ii) be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or to the
61 Administrative Agent. Within 60 days after the occurrence of any event giving rise to any rights or benefits provided by Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a) in favor of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Administrative Agent (i) will notify the Parent Borrower of such event or circumstance and (ii) provide the Parent Borrower with a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail (x) the event or circumstance giving rise to any benefit under Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a), (y) the effective date of, and the time period during which, compensation for any Additional Costs or Taxes are being claimed and (z) the determination of amount or amounts claimed thereby and detailed calculations with respect thereto; provided that, if such Lender or the Administrative Agent does not give the Parent Borrower such notice and certificate within the 60-day period set forth in this sentence, the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall be required to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent only for such Additional Costs and Taxes as are attributable to the period from and after the first date as of which such notice and certificate have been received by the Parent Borrower. Such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of any change in circumstances with respect to the event specified in the above-described notice and certificate as promptly as practicable after such Lender or the Administrative Agent obtains knowledge thereof. Such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall deliver the notice and certificate described in this paragraph (a) to the Parent Borrower in respect of any Additional Costs or Taxes unless it is then the general policy of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to pursue similar rights and remedies in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements. (b) With respect to Sections 2.14 and 2.16, the Parent Borrower shall have the right, should any Lender request any compensation or indemnity thereunder, to (i) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (A) promptly terminate such Lender's Commitment by irrevocable written notice of such termination to such Lender and the Administrative Agent without the necessity of complying with Sections 2.08(b) and (c) hereof, (B) reduce the total Commitments by the amount of such Lender's Commitment and (C) pay or prepay in immediately available funds all Loans owing to such Lender, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, or (ii) require such Lender to assign all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement,
62 without recourse to or representation or warranty by such Lender, to an assignee in accordance with Section 9.04; provided that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any statute, law, rule, regulation, order or decree of any Governmental Authority and (y) the assigning Lender shall have received from the relevant Borrower and the relevant Account Party and/or such assignee full payment in immediately available funds of the principal of and interest accrued on the Loans to the date of such assignment made by it hereunder and all other amounts owed to it hereunder that are subject to such assignment. The Parent Borrower shall have the right, should the Administrative Agent request any compensation or indemnity under such Sections, to require the Administrative Agent to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a successor Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (c) With respect to Section 2.14 or 2.16, (i) other than with respect to Section 2.16(b), neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to exercise any right or benefit afforded thereby and neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be obligated to reimburse any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to such Sections unless (x) such Lender or the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Parent Borrower in accordance with Section 9.01 the notice and the certificate described in Section 2.18(a) hereof and (y) the Parent Borrower has had a 30-Business Day period following the receipt of such notice and certificate (if the Parent Borrower in good faith disagrees with the assertion that any payment under such Sections is due or with the amount shown as due on such certificate and so notifies the Lender or the Administrative Agent of such disagreement within 10 Business Days following receipt of the notice and certificate) to negotiate with the requesting Lender or the Administrative Agent, which negotiations shall be conducted by the respective parties in good faith, and to agree upon another amount that will adequately compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent, it being expressly understood that if the Parent Borrower does not provide the required notice of its disagreement as provided above, the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay the amount shown as due on the certificate on the tenth Business Day following receipt thereof and further if the Parent Borrower does provide such required notice, and negotiations are entered into but do not result in agreement by the Parent Borrower and such Lender or the Administrative Agent within the 30-Business Day period, then the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be)
63 shall pay the amount shown as due on the certificate on the last day of such period, but in either event not earlier than the date as of which the relevant Additional Costs or Taxes are incurred, (ii) other than with respect to Other Taxes, unless the appropriate notice and certificate are delivered to the Parent Borrower within the 60-day period described in Section 2.18(a), the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall be liable only for Additional Costs, Taxes or amounts required to be paid which are attributable to the period from and after the date such notice and certificate have been received by such Borrower or such Account Party, as applicable, (iii) neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be liable for any amounts incurred as a result of any change in an Applicable Lending Office of any Issuing Bank or Lender to the extent that such Issuing Bank or Lender shall have had knowledge at the time of such change in Applicable Lending Office that reimbursement or recoupment under Section 2.14 would arise as a result of such change, (iv) each Lender or the Administrative Agent shall in good faith allocate all Additional Costs, Taxes and payments required to be made fairly among all its commitments (whether or not it seeks compensation from all affected borrowers), (v) in no event shall the Borrowers or the Account Parties be liable for any taxes (other than Other Taxes) that would not have been imposed but for a connection between such Lender or the Administrative Agent (other than by reason of the activities contemplated by this Agreement) and the relevant taxing jurisdiction, (vi) neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to exercise any right or benefit afforded hereby or receive any payment otherwise due under Sections 2.14 and 2.16 (including, without limitation, any repayment by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be) of any refund of Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(h)) which arises from any gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or the failure of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to comply with the terms of this Agreement, (vii) if Lender or the Administrative Agent shall have recouped any amount or received any offsetting tax benefit (other than a refund of Taxes as described in Section 2.16(h)) or reserve or capital benefits theretofore paid to it by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be), such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) an amount equal to the amount of the recoupment received by such Lender or the Administrative Agent reduced by any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent attributable to such recoupment, as determined in good faith by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, and (viii) the
64 liability of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to any Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to any taxes shall be reduced to the extent that such Lender or the Administrative Agent receives an offsetting tax benefit (or could have received such a benefit by taking reasonable measures to receive it); provided that there shall not be any reductions pursuant to this clause (viii) with respect to any tax benefit (x) the existence of which such Lender or Administrative Agent is unaware, (y) the claiming of which would result in any cost or tax to such Lender or the Administrative Agent (unless the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall have agreed to pay its reasonably allocable portion of such cost or tax) and (z) unless the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall agree to indemnify the Lender or the Administrative Agent to the extent any tax benefit taken into account under this clause (viii) is thereafter lost or becomes unavailable. (d) In addition to their obligations under Section 2.14 hereof, each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees to execute and deliver, and to make any required filings of, all certificates, agreements, documents, reports, statements and other instruments as are reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 2.18 and Sections 2.14 and 2.16. The Parent Borrower agrees to pay all filing fees incurred by any Lender or the Administrative Agent in performing its obligations under this Section 2.18. SECTION 2.19. Extension of Maturity Date. (a) The Parent Borrower may, not later than the date that is six months prior to the Maturity Date, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, request that the Maturity Date (such date being referred to hereinafter as the "Initial Maturity Date") be extended (the "Maturity Date Extension") to be the date that is two years after the Initial Maturity Date (such date being referred to herein as the "Extended Maturity Date"). Such notice shall offer each Lender the opportunity to extend the maturity of its Commitment to the Extended Maturity Date. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not less than 30 days prior to the Initial Maturity Date, either agree to extend the maturity of its Commitment (each Lender so agreeing to extend the maturity of its Commitment being referred to herein as a "Consenting Lender") or decline to extend the maturity of its Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period shall be deemed to have declined to extend the maturity of its Commitment)(each
65 Lender so declining or deemed to have declined being referred to herein as a "Non-Consenting Lender"). In the event that, on the 30th day prior to the Initial Maturity Date, less than 100% of the Lenders have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to extend the maturity of their Commitments, then during the period prior to the Initial Maturity Date, the Parent Borrower may either (x) elect to continue this Agreement at a reduced size with the Consenting Lenders or (y) arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution being referred to herein as an "Extending Lender"), which may (but need not) include any Lender, to extend Commitments (to become effective on the Initial Maturity Date) in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the total Commitments held by the Non-Consenting Lenders; provided that (i) each Extending Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) the Borrowers, the Account Parties and each Extending Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence such Extending Lender's Commitment and its status as a Lender. New Commitments created pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the Initial Maturity Date, provided that the conditions to the Maturity Date Extension are satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Maturity Date Extension and the new Commitments of any Extending Lenders shall not become effective unless, on a date selected by the Parent Borrower by notice to the Administrative Agent that is within five Business Days prior to the Initial Maturity Date, each of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the total amount of the Commitments of the Consenting Lenders and new Commitments of the Extending Lenders exceeds 50% of the Commitments in effect prior to giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lenders and the effectiveness of the new Commitments of the Extending Lenders; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct and no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in each case as of such date, and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate, dated such date and signed by the President, a Vice President or a Financial Officer of the Parent Borrower, to such effect; and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 (or, with respect to a Borrowing Subsidiary, clauses (a) and (b) of Section 4.03) as to the corporate power and authority
66 of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to borrow hereunder after giving effect to the Maturity Date Extension. (b) In the event that the Maturity Date Extension becomes effective in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section, on the Initial Maturity Date (i) the Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lenders shall terminate, each Non-Consenting Lender shall be released from its participation obligations in respect of any outstanding Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans and each Borrower or each Account Party, as applicable, shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the Non-Consenting Lenders, the outstanding principal of their respective Loans and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all accrued fees and other amounts then owing to the Non-Consenting Lenders hereunder, (ii) the new Commitments of the Extending Lenders, if any, shall become effective, (iii) the participation obligations hereunder in respect of any outstanding Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans shall be reallocated in accordance with the Commitments in effect after giving effect to the foregoing clauses and (iv) if there are any Loans then outstanding from Consenting Lenders and any new Commitments of Extending Lenders have become effective (with the result that the Loans comprising each Borrowing are not held by the Consenting Lenders and Extending Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Commitments), the Borrowers shall give a notice of optional prepayment hereunder in respect of all such outstanding Loans and may (but shall not be required to) give a Borrowing Request hereunder to fund such prepayment. (c) Concurrently with and following the effectiveness of the Maturity Date Extension, the term "Maturity Date", as such term is used herein (except to the extent such term is used in this Section) or under any other Loan Document, shall be deemed to mean the Extended Maturity Date. SECTION 2.20. Borrowing Subsidiaries. The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, designate any Subsidiary (other than any Eckerd Company or any Foreign Subsidiary) to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent a Subsidiary Borrowing Election with respect to such Subsidiary. The eligibility of any Borrowing Subsidiary to borrow hereunder shall terminate when the Administrative Agent receives a Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to such Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary Borrower Election delivered to the Administration Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of
67 the relevant Subsidiary and the Parent Borrower, and each Subsidiary Borrower Termination delivered to the Administrative Agent shall be duly executed on behalf of the Parent Borrower. The delivery of a Subsidiary Borrower Termination shall not affect any obligation of the relevant Subsidiary incurred in its capacity as a Borrower, and such Subsidiary shall continue to constitute a Borrowing Subsidiary for all purposes hereof (other than the right to borrow Loans) until all its obligations hereunder as a Borrower have been discharged and paid in full. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks of its receipt of any Subsidiary Borrower Election or Subsidiary Borrower Termination. ARTICLE III Representations and Warranties Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and Purchasing represents and warrants to the Lenders that: SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Loan Parties is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except, in each case, where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and Purchasing and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Holdings, the Parent Borrower, Purchasing or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
68 principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect or as to which the failure to be made or obtained and to be in full force and effect would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Collateral Agreement and (iii) filings of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) will not violate any applicable law or material regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of Holdings or any Subsidiary or any material order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any material provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Holdings or any Subsidiary, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, except Liens created under the Credit Agreement. SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2002, reported on by KPMG LLP, independent public accountants. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period in accordance with GAAP. (b) Since January 26, 2002, there has been no material adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to the business of Holdings and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), except for minor defects in title and leases being contested, in each case, that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.
69 (b) Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any defects in ownership or licenses and any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or Purchasing, threatened against or affecting Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions. (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures, material agreements and other material instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.
70 SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. No Loan Party is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Holdings or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, would result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan by a material amount, and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans by a material amount. SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished and taken as a whole with such other information) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, Holdings, the Parent Borrower and
71 Purchasing represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. SECTION 3.12. Material Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of Holdings that is a Material Subsidiary as of the Effective Date. ARTICLE IV Conditions SECTION 4.01. Effective Date. The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which each of the following conditions is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 9.02): (a) The Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received from each party hereto either (i) a counterpart of this Agreement signed on behalf of such party or (ii) written evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which may include telecopy transmission of a signed signature page of this Agreement) that such party has signed a counterpart of this Agreement. (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received a favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders and dated the Effective Date) of each of Shearman & Sterling, special New York counsel for the Loan Parties, and Charles R. Lotter, Esq., General Counsel of Holdings, substantially in the form of Exhibits B-1 and B-2, and covering such other matters relating to the Loan Parties, the Loan Documents or the Transactions as the Required Lenders shall reasonably request. Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and Purchasing hereby requests such counsel to deliver such opinions. (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably request relating to the organization, existence and good standing of each Loan Party, the authorization of the Transactions and any other legal matters relating to the Loan Parties,

(e) The Administrative Agent shall have received all fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the Effective Date, including, to the extent invoiced at least two Business Days prior to the Effective Date, reimbursement or payment of all out-of-pocket expenses required to be reimbursed or paid by any Loan Party hereunder. (f) The Collateral and Guarantee Requirement shall have been satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a completed Perfection Certificate dated the Effective Date and signed by an executive officer or Financial Officer of the Parent Borrower, together with all attachments contemplated thereby, and the Administrative Agent shall have received the results of a search of the Uniform Commercial Code (or equivalent) filings made with respect to the Parent Borrower in the jurisdictions contemplated by the Perfection Certificate and copies of the financing statements (or similar documents) disclosed by such search and evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the Liens indicated by such financing statements (or similar documents) are permitted by Section 6.02 or have been released. (g) The Administrative Agent shall have received evidence that the insurance required by the Collateral Agreement is in effect. (h) Prior to or concurrently with the effectiveness of the Commitments, the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreements shall be terminated and all loans and other amounts accrued or owing thereunder shall be paid.

73 Effective Date, giving pro forma effect to any Loans being made or Letters of Credit being issued on the Effective Date as if such Loans were made or such Letters of Credit were issued on the last day of such calendar month. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower and the Lenders of the Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall not become effective unless each of the foregoing conditions is satisfied (or waived pursuant to Section 9.02) at or prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 14, 2002 (and, in the event such conditions are not so satisfied or waived, the Commitments shall terminate at such time). SECTION 4.02. Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of each Issuing Bank to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) The representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable. (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

ARTICLE VIII
92 The Administrative Agent Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Parent Borrower, Purchasing or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or
93 have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Parent Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and the Parent Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Parent Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
94 have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Parent Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. ARTICLE IX Miscellaneous SECTION 9.01. Notices. (a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and subject to paragraph (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or
95 overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows: (i) if to Holdings, the Parent Borrower or Purchasing, to it at J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc., 6501 Legacy Drive, Mail Code 1304, Plano, TX 75024, Attention of the Treasurer (Telecopy No. (972) 431-2044), with a copy to the General Counsel of the Parent Borrower; (ii) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, Loan and Agency Services Group, One Chase Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10081, Attention of Mary McCormack (Telecopy No. (212) 552-7500), with a copy to JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park Avenue, New York 10017, Attention of Mr. Barry Bergman (Telecopy No. (212) 270-5646); and (iii) if to any other Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. (b) Notices and other communications to the Issuing Banks and Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank or Lender. The Administrative Agent, Holdings, the Parent Borrower or Purchasing may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. (c) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
96 preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Except with respect to any amendment to this Agreement contemplated by the definition of "Permitted Holding Company Reorganization" (which amendment shall be permitted if entered into by the parties referred to therein), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrowers, the Account Parties and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
97 thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any Guarantee Party from its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender or (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Collateral Agreement (except as expressly provided in paragraph (c) below) without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender, as the case may be. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all Liens on the Collateral created under the Collateral Agreement shall be automatically released in the event that the Parent Borrower receives a Rating of (i) Baa2 or better from Moody's and (ii) BBB or better from S&P. SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Parent Borrower and the other Loan Parties, jointly and severally, shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit and (iv) all fees associated with, and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with, any inventory audit performed by the Administrative Agent or any auditor that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent on
98 behalf of the Administrative Agent, as well as any such expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the monitoring and independent appraisals of such inventory, in each case as contemplated by Section 5.08. (b) The Parent Borrower and the other Account Parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) arise in connection with any judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of any Borrower or Account Party against such Indemnitee, (y) result from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (z) result from any dispute among the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or any of them, other than disputes resulting from the fault of any Loan Party. (c) To the extent that the Parent Borrower or any other Account Party fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the applicable Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the
99 unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the applicable Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither Holdings, any Borrower nor any Account Party shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days after written demand therefor. SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) neither Holdings, any Borrower nor any Account Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Holdings, any Borrower or any Account Party without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b)(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
100 with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of: (A) the Parent Borrower, provided that no consent of the Parent Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Parent Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
101 Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers and the Account Parties, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Holdings, the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Parent Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
102 (c)(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of Holdings, any Borrower, any Account Party, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) Holdings, the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, Holdings, the Borrowers and the Account Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Parent Borrower. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Parent Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers and the Account Parties, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under
103 this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
104 which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and either the Loans have become due and payable or any three Lenders representing at least $50,000,000 in aggregate amount of the Commitments have requested the Administrative Agent, in writing and in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, to declare the Loans to be forthwith due and payable, each Issuing Bank and Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Issuing Bank or Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any Account Party against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Issuing Bank or Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Issuing Bank or Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Issuing Bank and Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Issuing Bank or Lender may have.
