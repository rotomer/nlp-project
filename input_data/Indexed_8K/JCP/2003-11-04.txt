Exhibit 99 JCPENNEY NEWS RELEASE CONTACT JCPenney Sells Mexico Department Store Operation PLANO, Texas, October 29, 2003 - J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. and its subsidiary, J. C. Penney Mexico, Inc., announced today that they have entered into an agreement to sell their Mexico department store operation to Grupo Sanborns S.A. de C.V. of Mexico City. The stock sale transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax loss of approximately $40 million to J. C. Penney Company, Inc. The loss is principally related to currency translation costs accumulated since operations began in 1995 that have previously been reflected through reductions in stockholders' equity. The transaction will result in positive cash flow of approximately $25 million, including future anticipated tax benefits. The sale is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approval. It is expected that upon completion of this sale, the Mexican business will be treated as a discontinued operation. Following is a list of the six Mexico stores:
