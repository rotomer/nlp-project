Exhibit 99.1 JCPenney News Release JCPENNEY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Increase 43 Percent Financial Condition Continues to Strengthen PLANO, Texas, February 26, 2004 - J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) reported today that fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increased 43 percent to $0.83 versus comparable earnings of $0.58 per share last year. Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 percent to $1.21 versus comparable earnings of $0.95 per share last year. In accordance with current accounting rules, Eckerd drugstores and Mexico department store operations are being reported as discontinued operations, resulting in a net loss for the quarter and full year of $3.42 and $3.13 per share, respectively (see discussion below). Allen Questrom, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased with our continuing progress in the department store and catalog/Internet business. Department stores generated a comparable store sales increase for the third consecutive year. Catalog/Internet had its first sales gain after several years of repositioning, with very strong Internet sales, and a significant improvement in its contribution to results. We continue to focus on providing our customers with a compelling value across all three channels - department stores, catalog and Internet - through improved merchandise assortments, integrated marketing programs, and an enhanced shopping experience. We have implemented the majority of our centralization initiatives and are now positioned to turn our attention to improving execution and consistency, as well as creating a more competitive expense structure."

Looking ahead to 2004, Questrom added, "We anticipate a much better consumer environment this year, and the first half is expected to be especially strong. Last year's first quarter was impacted by a number of adverse factors. In 2004, higher refunds and lower withholding rates from the President's tax package, together with the current low-interest rate environment, will benefit the moderate customer. We expect our business to continue to generate sales and profit improvement, and are encouraged by recent business trends. I am confident that we are on track to achieve our operating profit goal of six to eight percent of sales in 2005." Addressing Eckerd, Questrom stated, "We have concluded that a sale of Eckerd, at an appropriate price, is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders, and will allow both JCPenney and Eckerd to maximize their potential. We are in active negotiations with interested parties and continue to make progress on a sale transaction. I appreciate all of the hard work and dedication that have created this valuable customer franchise, and know Eckerd associates will continue to serve customers in the highest professional manner, regardless of any change in ownership." Department Stores and Catalog/Internet - -------------------------------------- Fourth quarter operating profit increased 28 percent to $445 million compared with $349 million in last year's period. Operating profit was 7.3 percent of sales, an increase of 120 basis points. Operating profit reflects the continuation of substantial increases in the gross margin ratio as well as significant growth in catalog/Internet's profit contribution. Comparable department store sales increased 3.2 percent on a 13-week basis, representing the third consecutive year with strong holiday sales gains, and catalog/Internet sales increased 8.7 percent on a 13-week basis. Internet sales continue to experience strong growth, increasing by about 50 percent for both the fourth quarter and full year, and exceeded $600 million in sales for the full year. 2
Department Stores and Catalog gross margin increased by 190 basis points as a percent of sales in the quarter, and continues to benefit from better execution in a centralized environment. The acceleration of gross margin over the last several years reflects the Company's focus on providing the customer with fashionable, trend-right product that delivers compelling quality and value for the moderate customer. Since converting to a centralized organization, improvements in operating results reflect the leverage of centralized buying, significantly improved marketing, more effective store presentations, a repositioning of the catalog model and the exceptional growth of Internet. SG&A expenses increased as a result of planned increases in advertising, costs associated with the store distribution center network, and higher non-cash pension expense, as well as expenses related to this year's 53rd week. In addition, operating expenses include the previously announced charge of $20 million for contract cancellations and separation benefits associated with the first phase of the Company's cost savings initiative. The cost reduction program is expected to result in annualized cost savings in excess of $200 million when fully implemented. Discontinued Operations - ----------------------- During 2003, the Company evaluated strategic alternatives for all of its businesses, including Eckerd. In the fourth quarter, the Company's Board of Directors concluded that a plan to sell Eckerd, at an appropriate price, is in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. Having met the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," Eckerd's net assets were classified as "held for sale" and its results of operations and financial position reported as a discontinued operation beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. The accounting rules also require the recording of certain financial estimates related to a prospective sale, even though a definitive agreement has not been reached. This year's fourth quarter includes a non-cash charge of $450 million to reflect the Company's investment in Eckerd, as well as goodwill, at their estimated fair values. In addition, the Company was required to recognize a non-cash charge of $875 million to reflect the deferred tax liability for the excess of fair value over the tax basis of Eckerd. The tax basis of Eckerd is lower than its book basis because the Company's drugstore acquisitions were largely tax-free transactions. 3
Also included in discontinued operations is the loss on the November 2003 sale of the Company's Mexico department store operation. More specific information on the components of discontinued operations is shown on the attached financial schedules. The Company has also conformed prior period financial results to reflect Eckerd and Mexico as discontinued operations (see attached schedules). Financial Condition - -------------------- The Company's financial condition and liquidity continued to strengthen in 2003. Free cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $375 million for the year, substantially higher than original guidance (free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets). Cash flow benefited from improved operating results and capital expenditure management. In addition, cash flow also reflects the Company's $300 million cash contribution to the pension plan in the third quarter. At year-end, cash investments were approximately $3 billion and represented in excess of 50 percent of the Company's $5.4 billion of consolidated long-term debt. The Company's strong financial position continues to provide the resources to maintain strong liquidity and financial flexibility as it focuses on improving the performance of department stores and catalog/Internet. Guidance - -------- At this time, the Company is only providing 2004 guidance for department stores and catalog/Internet operating profit and first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations. For the year, operating profit is expected to improve by approximately 80 basis points to the area of 5.2 percent of sales, with contributions from both gross margin and SG&A. For the first quarter, earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.12 per share compared with last year's $0.05 per share. 4
