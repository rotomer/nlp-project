Exhibit 99.1 JCPenney News Release JCPENNEY REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS Operating Profit More Than Doubles Financial Condition Remains Strong PLANO, TX, May 18, 2004 -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) reported today that first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.38 per share compared to $0.05 per share last year. Net income includes a charge related to the previously announced treatment of Eckerd drugstore operations as a discontinued operation, as discussed below. Allen Questrom, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am very pleased with JCPenney's continuing progress and first quarter performance. Sales and operating profits far exceeded our plan, reflecting the strengthening of our value proposition for the moderate customer. Our management team is concentrating on delivering fashionable merchandise assortments, superior quality and compelling value with the convenience of our three shopping options - - stores, catalog and Internet. We are focused on consistent execution, creating a more competitive cost structure, and growing our business. Combined with the financial repositioning from the sale of Eckerd, these efforts are expected to continue to enhance shareholder value." Addressing second quarter, Questrom added, "We are optimistic that we will continue to see improvement in the economy and consumer spending. Because we face economic and geopolitical issues, we are planning sales and operating profits conservatively. We currently expect second quarter sales to increase low-single digits for both comparable department stores and Catalog/Internet, and earnings to be in the area of six cents per share compared to a three cent loss last year."

Operating Results - ----------------- First quarter operating profit was $229 million compared with $84 million last year, an increase of 350 basis points as a percent of sales. Operating profit of 5.7 percent of sales, reflects strong sales and continued improvement in the gross margin ratio, coupled with SG&A expense leverage. Comparable department store sales increased 9.5 percent. Sales performance reflects good customer response to both fashion and basic merchandise, planned marketing events and an improved store environment. With a 6.5 percent sales increase, Catalog/Internet's profit contribution continues to generate solid improvement. Customers are responding to improvements in specialty catalogs and the expanded assortments and convenience of the Internet. Internet sales increased about 45 percent for the quarter. Department Stores and Catalog gross margin increased by 90 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting good sell-through of seasonal product, less clearance merchandise, and the continued benefits from centralization initiatives. SG&A expenses were leveraged by 260 basis points as a percent of sales. Expenses were well managed and reflect benefits that continue to be derived from centralization. Expenses also reflect some early savings from the previously announced cost savings initiative, offset by additional implementation costs related to the program. Discontinued Operations - ------------------------ Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003, Eckerd results of operations and financial position were reported as a discontinued operation. The first quarter loss from discontinued operations includes a charge of $77 million, net of taxes, to adjust the fair value that was estimated at the end of 2003, as well as Eckerd's operating results for the quarter. Including this charge, net income for the quarter was $0.13 cents per share. Attached to this release are quarterly balance sheets and cash flow statements for prior periods that reflect Eckerd and the previously divested Mexico department store operations as discontinued operations. 2
Financial Condition - ------------------- The Company's financial condition continues to be strong. With better than planned results in the first quarter, free cash flow from continuing operations improved over last year. At the end of the quarter, cash investments were $3.0 billion and represented approximately 55 percent of the Company's $5.4 billion of consolidated long-term debt. The Company continues to expect to receive approximately $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of Eckerd. The sale process is progressing and is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal second quarter. The Company's strong financial position continues to provide the resources to support and maintain strong liquidity and financial flexibility as it focuses on improving the performance of the business.
