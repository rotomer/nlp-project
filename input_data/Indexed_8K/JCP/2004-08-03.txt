The Company's capital structure repositioning is comprised of the following: o Common Stock Repurchases (Up to $3.0 billion): The Company's Board of ----------------------------------------------- Directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program of $2.35 billion, and up to an additional $650 million of stock repurchases contingent upon the conversion of the Company's convertible debt. Assuming the closing stock price on Friday, July 30, 2004 of $40.00, the Company could repurchase up to 75 million common shares, or approximately 23 percent of its current diluted shares. The shares are expected to be acquired as soon as practicable through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions, with all shares currently expected to be repurchased within the next nine to 12 months. The actual number and the timing of share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable SEC rules. Credit Suisse First Boston has been retained to administer the program. o Convertible Debt ($650 million - reflected in both share repurchases ---------------------------------------------------------------------- and debt reductions): The Company currently anticipates that it will --------------------- exercise the October 2004 call provision of its $650 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt, which is convertible into 22.8 million common shares. If the Company's stock price continues to exceed the conversion price, it is expected that virtually all holders of such notes will convert to common shares. o Debt Reductions ($2.3 billion): The Company's debt reduction program -------------------------------- consists of the retirement of $2.3 billion of debt in 2004 and 2005. These debt reductions include the anticipated conversion of the convertible debt, early retirements of long-term debt, the termination of the off-balance sheet Eckerd receivables securitization program, and normal long-term debt maturities (see attached schedule). Early retirements are expected to occur in the third quarter of 2004, principally through the exercise of call and sinking fund provisions. 2
The Company expects to incur approximately $50 million of pre-tax charges in the third quarter related to the early retirement of debt. These one-time charges will be recorded as a separate component of income from continuing operations. o Eckerd Lease Obligations ($3.4 billion): The purchasers of Eckerd ------------------------------------------- assumed real property lease obligations as part of the sale transaction. Consequently, the Company eliminated $3.4 billion of the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations, principally related to Eckerd store leases. Preferred Stock Redemption - -------------------------- The Company has elected to redeem its outstanding preferred shares, all of which are held in its 401(k) savings plan. Preferred shares, which are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, will be converted into approximately 10 million common shares. The conversion of preferred shares, which will occur in August 2004, will reduce annual net dividends by approximately $11 million, after tax. Interest Expense - ----------------- Based on the above actions, interest expense is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million in the third quarter and $70 million to $75 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts exclude the $50 million of one-time charges related to early debt retirements. Diluted Shares and Weighted Average Share Counts - -------------------------------------------------- If a repurchase of 75 million shares is accomplished, the Company would have approximately 253 million diluted shares at the end of this program, compared with 320 million diluted shares currently. The components of diluted shares and the expected impact on weighted average shares used for diluted earnings per share calculations are shown on the attached schedule. 3
July Sales and Second Quarter Earnings Guidance - ----------------------------------------------- Sales for the four weeks ended July 31, 2004 were above expectations, with a good customer response to early back to school marketing events. Comparable department store sales increased 8.1 percent for the period and Catalog/Internet sales decreased 1.1 percent, with Internet sales increasing over 30 percent. Because the Company is providing July sales information as part of this release, the July sales release scheduled for August 5, 2004 will not be issued (see attached sales table). Based on strong sales, coupled with continued improvement in both gross margin and Catalog/Internet's profit contribution, management has raised its guidance for second quarter earnings from continuing operations to the range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share.
