EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description 99.1 J. C. Penney Company, Inc. News Release issued February 24, 2005
Exhibit 99.1 JCPENNEY FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 40 PERCENT Full Year Operating Profit Increases 66 Percent to 7.1 Percent of Sales 2005 Earnings Per Share Expected to Increase Approximately 30 Percent PLANO, Texas, February 24, 2005 -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increased 40 percent to $1.16 per share from $0.83 per share last year. On a dollar basis, income from continuing operations increased to $328 million from $253 million last year. Full year operating profit increased 66 percent to 7.1 percent of sales, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 84 percent to $2.23 per share compared to $1.21 per share last year. The increase in earnings per share was primarily the result of continued improvement in sales productivity, growth in gross margin and leverage of SG&A expenses. Net income for the quarter, including the effects of discontinued operations, was $1.17 per share compared to a loss of $3.42 per share last year. Myron (Mike) Ullman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with the improvements we continue to achieve in our business. Fourth quarter and full year operating profit exceeded our original expectations and represents the fourth consecutive year of substantial earnings improvement. Our results reflect the impact of effective merchandising programs, including transition of seasonal product, compelling marketing and continued improvement in the shopping experience in our stores." Ullman added, "2004 was a breakout year for JCPenney as a result of the organization's focus on the execution of our business plan. The Company has strong momentum as we pursue compelling merchandise initiatives that respond to the needs and wants of our customer. Based on our improved operating performance, completion of the sale of Eckerd and the ongoing capital repositioning program, the Company's financial position has improved significantly. As we enter 2005, the Company has increased financial flexibility to support the long range plan that we are developing and places us in a good position to implement additional capital structure repositioning actions."
Department Stores and Catalog/Internet - --------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter, comparable department store sales increased 3.0 percent with positive results in all merchandise divisions and all regions of the country. For a comparable 13-week period, catalog/Internet sales increased 3.9 percent over last year. The Internet component of sales increased 33 percent for the quarter and continues to be the fastest growing sales channel. Gross margin for the fourth quarter improved by 130 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting the benefits of better buying, merchandise flow, seasonal transition and marketing. Gross margin included a LIFO credit of $18 million, or approximately $0.04 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to a $6 million credit in 2003. SG&A expenses were 27.6 percent of sales and well leveraged, declining by 100 basis points as a percent of sales. 2004 SG&A expenses included $8 million, or about $0.02 per share, related to lease accounting adjustments. SG&A expenses decreased by $64 million from last year, with the decrease attributable to last year's 53rd week, which accounted for approximately $65 million. Last year's fourth quarter also included $20 million of pre-tax charges related to the implementation of expense savings initiatives. Fourth quarter operating profit was $581 million or 9.6 percent of sales, compared with $445 million last year. This represents an increase of nearly 31 percent, or 230 basis points as a percent of sales. For the full year, operating profit increased over 66 percent to $1.3 billion, or 7.1 percent of sales. Real Estate and Other - ---------------------- Real estate and other consists principally of charges related to the previously announced management transition. Cash Flow and Financial Condition - ---------------------------------- Free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets) for the year totaled $599 million and represented the fifth consecutive year of positive free cash flow. Capital expenditures were $412 million for the year with the majority of spending supporting the Company's new store program and improvements to existing space.
As of January 29, 2005, the Company had cash investments of $4.7 billion, which was higher than normal as the Company completes the share and debt reduction program announced in August 2004. Long-term debt totaled $3.9 billion, including $609 million of current maturities. Capital Structure Repositioning - -------------------------------- Execution of the capital structure repositioning plan announced in conjunction with the sale of Eckerd is progressing in line with expectations. As of January 29, 2005, the Company had repurchased approximately 50 million shares of common stock for about $2 billion, and continues to expect to complete the program by the end of the first half of 2005. In addition, during 2004 the Company retired $1.7 billion of long-term debt, including $221 million of off-balance sheet securitized receivables and the conversion of $650 million of convertible debt. 2005 Guidance - -------------- February sales have started strong and comparable department stores sales are now expected to increase mid-single digits for the month. For the balance of the first quarter and full year, comparable store sales are expected to increase low-single digits. Catalog/Internet sales are expected to increase low-to-mid single digits for both the first quarter and full year. Operating profit for the year is expected to increase to about 7.6 percent of sales, driven by moderate expansion of gross margin and continued SG&A leverage. The Company's Board of Directors is considering a new common stock repurchase program in 2005 of at least $600 million. The final size of the new program will depend upon investor decisions related to the exercise of the put option on the Company's $400 million 7.4% Debentures, due 2037. If investors elect to exercise options for less than $400 million, the majority of the difference will be used for open market debt repurchases, with the balance allocated to share repurchases. The exercise date of the put option expires on March 1, 2005. The Company currently expects earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.53 per share in the first quarter and $2.89 to $3.01 per share for the full year. Full year earnings guidance reflects the impact of $0.08 per share for charges associated with anticipated open market repurchases of debt. Also included in this guidance is an estimated charge of $0.05 per share related to employee stock options, which the Company will begin expensing in the first quarter of 2005.
