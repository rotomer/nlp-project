Exhibit 99.1 JCPENNEY ANNOUNCES NEW CAPITAL STRUCTURE REPOSITIONING PROGRAM $1 Billion Program Targeted for Equity and Debt Reductions Company Declares May 2, 2005 Dividend PLANO, Texas, March 18, 2005 - J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion capital structure repositioning program. The new program is to be funded with approximately $600 million of free cash flow generated in 2004 and $400 million previously allocated to the early retirement of the 7.4% Debentures due 2037. The 2037 Debentures contained a put option that expired March 1, 2005, with virtually all of the debentures remaining outstanding. The program consists of $750 million of common stock repurchases and $250 million of open-market debt repurchases, and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. As previously disclosed, the Company expects to take pre-tax charges of approximately $30 million, or $0.08 per share, during 2005 related to the early retirement of debt, which will continue to be reported separately as "bond premiums and unamortized costs." Robert Cavanaugh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said, "The expansion of our capital structure repositioning is made possible by the Company's consistent operating improvement, strong liquidity, and positive free cash flow. This new program reflects the confidence we have in our business and further strengthens our financial profile." The following update pertains to the capital structure repositioning program announced in August 2004. As of March 17, 2005, the Company had repurchased 51.8 million shares of common stock for about $2 billion, representing about 68% of the 2004 repurchase program.
The Company will complete the August 2004 debt reduction program in May with the maturity and payment of the $193 million 7.05% Note on May 23, 2005. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on its common stock, payable May 2, 2005, to the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on April 8, 2005.
