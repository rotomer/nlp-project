Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On September 15, 2005, the Human Resources Committee of J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. ("Corporation") approved an adjustment to the 2005 total J. C. Penney Company, Inc. sales and operating profit results of continuing operations performance goals under the Corporation's Management Incentive Compensation Program ("Incentive Program"). The adjustment reflects the recent sale of Lojas Renner S. A. ("Renner") and the subsequent classification by J. C. Penney Company, Inc. ("Company") of Renner operating results as a discontinued operation. Annual profit incentive compensation can be earned under the Incentive Program by management employees, including executive officers who are anticipated to be named in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company's 2006 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement. The Incentive Program ties incentive compensation to Company performance, with no incentive payment for performance well below plan and up to 200% of incentive targets for superior results.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. J. C. PENNEY COMPANY, INC. By: /s/ Michael T. Theilmann ---------------------------------- Michael T.
