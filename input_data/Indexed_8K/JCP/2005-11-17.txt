Exhibit 10.1 J. C. PENNEY COMPANY, INC. 2005 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD -- 2005 NON-ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR ANNUAL GRANT -- Name: Restricted Stock Unit Grant - --------------------------- A restricted stock unit grant for xxx units was granted to you on xxxx. Each restricted stock unit shall at all times be deemed to have a value equal to the then-current fair market value of one share of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Common Stock of 50(cent) par value ("Common Stock"). This grant is subject to all the terms, rules, and conditions of the J. C. Penney Company, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan ("Plan"). The number of restricted stock units granted to you will be adjusted as provided in the Plan in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spinoff, distribution to holders of Common Stock other than cash dividends, or the like. You will be credited with a quarterly distribution of an amount equivalent to the dividend declared on Common Stock on the restricted stock units until such time as the units are converted to shares of Common Stock. Any such dividends shall be converted into a number of additional restricted stock units equal to the aggregate dividend which would have been paid with respect to the number of restricted stock units then credited to you under this grant divided by the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day on which such dividends are paid. Any such additional restricted stock units shall vest at the same time as the restricted stock units granted hereunder. Payment Date - --------------- Upon your separation from Board Service, the Company will issue to you shares of Common Stock in cancellation of the restricted stock units. If your separation from Board service is for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination as defined in the Plan, the restricted stock units will be forfeited. The beneficiary listed on your J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Beneficiary Designation Form will receive the vested shares upon separation due to death. Taxes - ------ At the time the Company issues to you, in cancellation of the restricted stock units, shares of Common Stock, the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date (the opening price of the Common Stock on the NYSE, or if the Common Stock does not trade on such date, the closing price reported in the composite transaction table on the last trading date immediately preceding such date) multiplied by the number of vested shares will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099. The fair market value is subject to Federal Income Tax and Social Security Self-Employment Tax. Change of Control - ----------------- The restricted stock unit award vests immediately without regard to the vesting date listed above upon a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in Attachment A).
Attachment A A Change of Control Event will have occurred if there is a change of ownership, a change of effective control, or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as "Company" is defined in the J. C. Penney Company, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan). 1. Change of ownership occurs on the date that a person or persons acting as a group acquires ownership of stock of the Company that together with stock held by such person or group constitutes more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of such corporation. 2. Notwithstanding whether the Company has undergone a change of ownership, a Change of Effective control occurs (a) when a person or persons acting as a group acquires within a 12-month period 35 percent of total voting power of the stock of the Company or (b) a majority of the board of Directors is replaced within 12 months if not previously approved by a majority of the members. A change in effective control also may occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction has a Change in Control Event, i.e. multiple change in control events. 3. Change in ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets occurs when a person or persons acting as a group acquires assets that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent of the total fair market of all assets of the Company immediately prior to the acquisition. A transfer of assets by the Company is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to - (i) A shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock; (ii) An entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company; (iii) A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company; or (iv) An entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (iii). Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase assets of the Company at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar business transaction with the Company.
