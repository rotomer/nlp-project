Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On December 6, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. amended each of (i) the Supplemental Retirement Program for Management Profit-Sharing Associates of J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. ("SRP"), (ii) the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan ("BRP"), and (iii) the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Mirror Savings Plans I, II, and III (collectively, the " Mirror Plans"). The SRP, BRP, and Mirror Plans were amended to comply with the transitional relief provided under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), and the Proposed Regulations promulgated thereunder. The full text of the amendments to the SRP, BRP, and Mirror Plans are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 hereto, and are incorporated herein by reference. The amendments to the SRP, BRP, and Mirror Plans are effective as of January 1, 2005. The SRP provides certain supplemental retirement benefits, including Social Security substitute payments until age 62, to certain management employees, including executive officers, who voluntarily retire prior to age 65 in accordance with the SRP and whose aggregate retirement and estimated Social Security benefits would otherwise be below specified minimum retirement income levels. Participation in the SRP is limited to employees eligible for participation on or prior to December 31, 1995. The Code imposes certain limitations on the maximum benefits that may be earned under "qualified" retirement plans such as the Company's Pension Plan and its Savings Plan. The BRP provides to impacted management employees certain benefits which, under the Code, can not be earned under the Company's Pension Plan. The Mirror Savings Plans provide to impacted management employees certain benefits which, under the Code, cannot be earned under the Company's Savings Plan.
