Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. J. C. Penney Company, Inc. issued a news release on February 16, 2006, announcing its fourth quarter results of operations and financial condition. This information is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The news release referred to above contains the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. Although it is not a generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) measure, it is derived from components of the Company's consolidated GAAP cash flow statement. Free cash flow from continuing operations is defined as cash provided by operating activities less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets. Although free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes it is important in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measuring the ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Positive free cash flow generated by a company indicates the amount of cash available for reinvestment in the business, or cash that can be returned to investors through increased dividends, stock repurchase programs, debt retirements, or a combination of these. Conversely, negative free cash flow indicates the amount of cash that must be raised from investors through new debt or equity issues, reduction in available cash balances or a combination of these. Based on the seasonality of the Company's business, cumulative free cash flow generally runs negative for the first nine months of the year and turns positive in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The Company's calculation of free cash flow may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description 99.1 J. C. Penney Company, Inc. News Release issued February 16, 2006
Exhibit 99.1 JCPENNEY OPERATING PROFIT INCREASES 22.5 PERCENT IN 2005 Board of Directors Approves New $750 Million Common Stock Repurchase Program and Plan to Increase Annualized Dividend by 44 Percent First Year of Long Range Plan Validates Vision for Growth 2005 Results Summary o Operating profit increased 14.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 22.5 percent for the year o Income from continuing operations increased 38.9 percent for the quarter, and 48.7 percent for the year o Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 68.4 percent for the quarter and 74.1 percent for the year o Positive free cash flow exceeds $700 million o Opened 18 new stores in 2005, the most in eight years o Sales for jcp.com surpass $1 billion PLANO, Texas, Feb. 16, 2006 -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) reported fourth quarter and full year income from continuing operations that were significantly ahead of 2004 levels. Income from continuing operations continued to benefit from substantial improvement in core operating results coupled with the effects of the company's recently completed capital structure repositioning program. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year were $1.92 per share and $3.83 per share, respectively, and included $0.21 per share and $0.20 per share, respectively, from the effects of a previously disclosed one-time tax benefit. Net income in the fourth quarter, including discontinued operations, increased to $2.34 per share. "Our performance in 2005 demonstrates the progress we are making in executing JCPenney's Long Range Plan objective to achieve leadership in the retail sector," said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer. "In 2005, we continued to produce sustained growth in quarterly and annual sales and operating profit. In addition, our growth initiatives and our capital structure repositioning program combined to generate superior EPS growth. Based on these results, our board of directors has demonstrated their confidence in the company's
longer term prospects by authorizing a new $750 million common stock repurchase program and approving a plan to increase the dividend by 44 percent." Ullman added, "Over the past year, we have made substantial improvements in our merchandise assortments and taken actions to make JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop. We will celebrate this with the launch next month of the largest branding campaign in the company's history. This campaign will include the opening of the JCPenney Experience virtual store in New York City's Times Square and our exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards. "As we look ahead, we recognize that there may be short-term disruptions caused by industry consolidation and that our customer continues to be faced with issues such as high energy prices and changes to consumer credit payment terms. Nevertheless, we are focused on each of the initiatives in our Long Range Plan and capitalizing on the many opportunities that lie before us." Growth Initiatives - ------------------- During 2005, the company launched its 2005 to 2009 Long Range Plan, identifying four key strategies: 1) making an emotional connection with the customer, 2) making JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop, 3) making JCPenney a great place to work, and 4) becoming a leader in performance and execution. In support of the Long Range Plan, the company introduced lifestyle merchandising, which led to the launch of several new private and exclusive brands, including nicole by Nicole Miller, W - Work to Weekend, nick(it), a.n.a, Solitude, Studio, and Miss Bisou, and the expansion of Chris Madden for the JCPenney Home Collection. In 2005, the company opened the most new stores in one year since 1997, opening 18 stores, the majority of which were in the successful off-mall format. In addition, the company launched the rollout of a new POS system that reduces transaction time and will provide Internet connectivity to over 35,000 POS devices to enhance the customer shopping experience. During 2005, more than 430 stores were converted to the new technology, with the remaining stores scheduled for conversion in 2006.
Operating Performance - --------------------- Fourth quarter total department store sales increased 4.2 percent and comparable department store sales increased 2.6 percent. Sales were generally positive throughout the store with the best regional performance in the southeastern and western regions of the country. During the quarter, Direct (catalog/Internet) sales increased 3.7 percent, with sales for www.jcp.com increasing approximately 22 percent. For the full year, Internet sales increased nearly 28 percent and, as previously announced, surpassed the $1 billion mark. Total net sales for the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion. On a FIFO basis, gross margin increased about 20 basis points. Gross margin for the quarter was down slightly on a LIFO basis, at 37.0 percent of sales, due to a reduction in this year's LIFO adjustment versus last year. In 2005, LIFO generated a credit of about $1 million compared with an $18 million credit last year. SG&A expenses were well managed during the quarter and improved by 110 basis points, to 26.4 percent of sales. SG&A expenses benefited principally from changes in our previously announced store staffing model, more effective use of advertising and efficiencies in the Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating profit was $655 million, a 14.5 percent increase from last year's $572 million. As a percent of sales, operating profit increased 100 basis points to 10.6 percent of sales from 9.6 percent of sales last year. For the full year, operating profit increased 22.5 percent to $1,577 million on approximately $18.8 billion in net sales. Income from continuing operations increased 48.7 percent to $977 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 74.1 percent to $3.83 per share. Net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $1,088 million, or $4.26 per share. Other Charges and Credits - --------------------------- Net interest expense was $39 million in the quarter and continues to benefit from rising short-term interest rates on the company's cash investments. In addition, the company recognized $13 million of income from real estate and other, principally related to ongoing real estate operations and gains on the sale of properties. In last year's fourth quarter, real estate and other was a charge of $25 million, including costs associated with the company's senior management transition.
As previously reported, taxes for continuing operations benefited principally from the elimination of state tax valuation allowances as a result of the company's ability to utilize the related net operating loss tax assets. This reduced the effective income tax rate and increased earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter. Discontinued Operations - ----------------------- Discontinued operations in this year's fourth quarter consists principally of positive tax adjustments resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the company's former Eckerd drugstore operations, which the company sold in 2004. Cash Flow and Financial Condition - ----------------------------------- Free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets) for the year totaled approximately $700 million, representing the sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow and exceeding the most recent guidance. Capital expenditures were $535 million for the year. As of Jan. 28, 2006, the company had cash investments of $3 billion and long-term debt totaled $3.5 billion. Common Stock Repurchase Program and Dividends - ---------------------------------------------- During 2005, the company completed its previously authorized capital structure repositioning program with the repurchase of $2.2 billion of common stock and $400 million of long-term debt retirements. Consistent with the company's long-term financial strategy, the company's board of directors has authorized a new $750 million common stock repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006. In addition, the board has approved a dividend plan that provides for a 44 percent increase in the annualized common stock dividend, to $0.72 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend that the company expects to pay in May.
