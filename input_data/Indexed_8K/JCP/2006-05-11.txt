Exhibit 99.1 JCPENNEY FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 45 PERCENT Operating Profit Increased 20 Percent to 8.7 Percent of Sales Progress on Long Range Plan for Growth Continues First Quarter 2006 Highlights - ----------------------------- o Continued strengthening of operating performance - EPS from continuing operations increased 45 percent o Increased the quarterly dividend by 44 percent o Revealed an accelerated new store growth plan beginning in 2007 o Announced an exciting new beauty initiative with Sephora PLANO, Texas, May 11, 2006 -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) first quarter 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 45.2 percent to $0.90 per share from $0.62 per share in last year's period. Operating profit increased 19.8 percent to $369 million from $308 million last year. Operating profit increased 120 basis points in this year's first quarter to 8.7 percent of sales, and benefited from growth in sales, gross margin and leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses. On a per share basis, net income in the quarter, including the effects of discontinued operations, was $0.89 per share compared to $0.63 per share last year. "We are pleased with the progress the Company continues to make in executing the long range plan, which is focused on building long term growth for our business. We have established strong momentum and are focused on accelerating growth and becoming a leader in the retail industry," said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer. "In the first quarter we delivered a strong increase in earnings, achieving our twelfth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales gains and continued to improve both our gross margin and SG&A expense ratios."
Ullman added, "While economic indicators are generally positive, we know that our customers - the moderate consumer - are faced with high energy prices and increasing interest rates. This makes it even more important that we deliver the style, quality, and shopping experience they want." The Company believes it is well positioned to benefit from the changes occurring across the retail landscape. To capitalize on the opportunity for JCPenney in this new environment, the Company is focused on executing the long range plan to drive continued improvement in its existing business and to deliver growth. Commenting on its growth strategies, Ullman added, "We have recently announced a number of exciting new programs to help achieve our goals, including a joint initiative with Sephora that will make beauty available to the JCPenney customer in our stores and through jcp.com; the acceleration of new store growth that will add approximately 175 new stores over the next four years; a cycle time reduction program that will increase the speed of new product introductions; and further improvement in our multi-channel initiative with jcp.com access at all our stores. To demonstrate the confidence we have in our prospects, we have increased our EPS growth target to 16 percent per year over the next four years." Operating Results - ----------------- First quarter total department store sales increased 2.2 percent and comparable department store sales increased 1.3 percent, in line with the Company's expectations. Sales were strongest in fine jewelry, family footwear, children's, and men's with the best regional performance in the southeastern and western regions of the country. During the quarter, Direct sales increased 3.9 percent, primarily as a result of continued strength from jcp.com, which increased approximately 22 percent on top of a 35 percent increase last year. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 41.9 percent of sales and benefited from better performance from private brands as well as continued improvement in seasonal transition and merchandise flow. SG&A expenses were well managed during the quarter, and improved by 40 basis points, to 33.2 percent of sales. SG&A expenses reflect leverage of salary costs and efficiencies in the Direct business, which were partially offset by higher marketing costs, including the launch of the Company's new branding campaign in March.
First quarter operating profit was $369 million, a 19.8 percent increase from last year's $308 million. As a percent of sales, operating profit increased 120 basis points to 8.7 percent of sales from 7.5 percent of sales last year. Other Charges and Credits - ------------------------- Net interest expense was $34 million in the quarter and continued to benefit from rising short-term interest rates on the Company's cash investments. In addition, the Company recognized $13 million of income from real estate and other, principally related to ongoing real estate operations and gains on the sale of properties. In last year's first quarter, real estate and other provided income of $22 million. Income from continuing operations increased 24.6 percent to $213 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 45.2 percent to $0.90 per share. Net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $210 million, or $0.89 per share. Discontinued Operations - ------------------------ During the quarter a net after-tax charge of $3 million, or about $0.01 per share, was recorded related to ongoing adjustments to Eckerd reserves. Financial Condition - ------------------- The Company's financial condition remains strong. As of April 29, 2006, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $2.8 billion and long-term debt, including current maturities, of $3.5 billion. Merchandise inventories were $3.4 billion, which was in line with expectations, and reflect increases associated with new stores. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $269 million, which was in line with expectations. Common Stock Repurchase Program and Dividends - --------------------------------------------- As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new $750 million common stock repurchase program in February. Due to the planned announcements of important strategic initiatives near the end of the quarter, primarily accelerated store growth and the Sephora initiative, no stock was repurchased in the first quarter. The Company continues to expect that the current repurchase program will be completed in 2006 and that share repurchases will essentially offset the exercise of employee stock options for weighted average
share calculation purposes. In addition, as previously announced, the Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the dividend by 44 percent, to $0.72 per share on an annualized basis. Second Quarter 2006 Guidance - ----------------------------- The following second quarter guidance reflects the Company's current expectations: o Comparable store sales: low single digit increase o Direct sales: low single digit increase o Operating profit rate: modest improvement year over year, primarily as a result of SG&A expense leverage o Interest expense: about $40 million o Income tax rate: lower effective tax rate than first quarter, trending to approximately 37 percent for the year o Earnings per share: in the area of $0.60 per share o Average diluted shares: approximately 238 million average diluted shares of common stock in the second quarter (including about 3 million common stock equivalents) Reflecting improved performance in the first quarter, the Company now expects full year earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.34 per share.

Exhibit 99.2 Glossary of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations - cash provided by operating - ----------------------------------------------- activities from continuing operations less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets. Management believes free cash flow from continuing operations is important in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measuring the ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Positive free cash flow generated by a company indicates the amount of cash available for reinvestment in the business, or cash that can be returned to investors through increased dividends, stock repurchase programs, debt retirements or a combination of these. Conversely, negative free cash flow indicates the amount of cash that must be raised from investors through new debt or equity issues, reduction in available cash balances or a combination of these. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is net cash provided by operating activities. Operating Profit/Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) - represents gross - ------------------------------------------------------------- margin less selling, general and administrative expenses, and is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of the retail operations. Operating profit/EBIT excludes net interest expense, bond premiums and unamortized costs and real estate and other. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is income from continuing operations before income taxes.
