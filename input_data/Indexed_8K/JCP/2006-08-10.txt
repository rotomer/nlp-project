Exhibit 99.1 JCPENNEY REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER OPERATING PROFIT Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Increased 63 Percent to $0.75 Management Raises Full Year Earnings Per Share Guidance to $4.55 Second Quarter 2006 Highlights o Comparable store sales increased 6.6 percent o Operating Profit increased 27.2 percent, or 100 basis points as a percent of sales o Repurchased 8 million shares of common stock for $530 million o Completed new POS rollout offering jcp.com access at over 35,000 store registers PLANO, Texas, Aug. 10, 2006 -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) reported record second quarter operating profit and earnings. Operating profit increased 27.2 percent to $271 million from $213 million last year and improved 100 basis points to 6.4 percent of sales. Operating profit improvement was driven by strong sales performance, coupled with improved gross margin and leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses. Second quarter 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 63.0 percent to $0.75 from $0.46 last year. Earnings per share in both years include the benefits of one-time tax credits as well as the effects of the Company's ongoing share repurchase program. "The Company had an excellent second quarter, with good customer response to fine jewelry, children's and women's accessories, as well as a solid rebound in apparel categories, particularly women's," said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have broad-based momentum entering the back half of the year and are confident in our competitive positioning. While we are cautiously optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead, we believe that it is prudent to plan conservatively in the current environment." Ullman added, "We continue to improve the fundamentals of our existing businesses and are poised for the acceleration of our new store growth. In the third quarter, we will open 25 stores,
with 17 in the new and successful off-mall format. Twenty of these stores will open on October 6th, the most store openings in a single day in the Company's recent history, and beginning in 2007, we plan to open 50 stores per year." Operating Results - --------------------- Second quarter total department store sales increased 7.1 percent and comparable department store sales increased 6.6 percent. Sales were ahead of the Company's initial guidance and increased in all merchandise divisions and regions of the country. The strongest merchandise results were in fine jewelry, children's and women's accessories, and the best regional performance was in the west and southeast. During the quarter, Direct sales increased 2.7 percent, and jcp.com sales increased approximately 25 percent. Gross margin improved by 30 basis points to 38.4 percent of sales, reflecting continued benefits from private brand performance and better flow of merchandise. SG&A expenses improved by 70 basis points to 32.0 percent of sales, and reflect leverage of salary and marketing costs. Second quarter operating profit was $271 million, a 27.2 percent increase from last year's $213 million. Other Charges and Credits - -------------------------- Net interest expense was $32 million in the quarter and continued to benefit from rising short-term interest rates on the Company's cash investments. Real Estate and Other provided income of $9 million in the current quarter, principally related to ongoing real estate operations. Last year, Real Estate and Other contributed $14 million of income in the second quarter, including approximately $8 million in gains from the sale of properties. Second quarter taxes are shown net of $26 million, or $0.11 per share, in one-time federal and state income tax credits, which reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter to 28.2 percent. Excluding these one-time credits, the tax rate would have been 38.8 percent.
Financial Condition and Other Items - ----------------------------------- The Company continues to maintain a strong financial condition. As of July 29, 2006, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion and long-term debt, including current maturities, of $3.5 billion. Merchandise inventories were well controlled at $3.5 billion, with increases associated with the planned opening of 25 new stores in the third quarter essentially offset by better merchandise flow. Free cash flow for the first half was in line with expectations and the Company continues to anticipate annual free cash flow of approximately $200 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 8 million shares of common stock for $530 million. Management expects to complete the current repurchase program in the third quarter. In addition, the Company completed the rollout of its new POS system during this year's second quarter. This new system offers faster transaction times and provides access to jcp.com at all registers, enhancing the shopping experience ------- and expanding the merchandise assortment. Earnings Guidance - ------------------- The following guidance reflects the Company's current expectations for the third and fourth quarters: o Comparable store sales: low single digit increase in both quarters. o Direct sales: low single digit increase in the third quarter, mid single digit increase in the fourth quarter (note; the fourth quarter includes a 53rd week in 2006). o 53rd Week (4Q): approximately $150 million of sales for department stores (no impact on comp sales) and $50 million of sales for Direct. Incremental SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. o Operating profit margin: moderate improvement year over year in each quarter, primarily as a result of SG&A expense leverage. o Interest expense: approximately $40 million in each quarter. o Income tax rate: approximately 38.5 percent in both quarters. o Average diluted shares: approximately 228 million average diluted shares of common stock in both the third and fourth quarters, and full year average diluted shares of about 232 million (all share guidance includes about 3 million common stock equivalents).
o Earnings per share: approximately $1.07 per share in the third quarter and approximately $1.84 in the fourth quarter. Full year earnings are now expected to be in the area of $4.55 per share.

Exhibit 99.2 Glossary of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations - cash provided by operating - ----------------------------------------------- activities from continuing operations less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets. Management believes free cash flow from continuing operations is important in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measuring the ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Positive free cash flow generated by a company indicates the amount of cash available for reinvestment in the business, or cash that can be returned to investors through increased dividends, stock repurchase programs, debt retirements or a combination of these. Conversely, negative free cash flow indicates the amount of cash that must be raised from investors through new debt or equity issues, reduction in available cash balances or a combination of these. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is net cash provided by operating activities. Operating Profit/Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) - represents gross - ------------------------------------------------------------- margin less selling, general and administrative expenses, and is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of the retail operations. Operating profit/EBIT excludes net interest expense, bond premiums and unamortized costs and real estate and other. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is income from continuing operations before income taxes.
