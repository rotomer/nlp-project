For the quarter, operating profit improved 50 basis points to 11.3 percent of sales and was driven by strong gains in gross margin.

For the full year, operating profit improved 100 basis points to 9.7 percent of sales and earnings from continuing operations increased to $4.88 per share. Last years fourth quarter and full year income from continuing operations included income of $0.21 and $0.20 per share, respectively, from one-time tax credits. Net income for this years fourth quarter and full year, including the impact of discontinued operations, was $2.09 and $4.96 per share, respectively.
PLANO, Texas, Feb. 22, 2007
The fourth quarter marked a very strong end to a year of great achievement at JCPenney, said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman III, chairman and chief executive officer of JCPenney. Over the course of 2006, we saw continued growth in both sales and operating profit. This reflects the ongoing
 
improvements we made in our merchandise assortments, as well as further refinements to our highly effective planning and allocation systems to ensure we have the right products for our customers whenever they want them. We also launched our accelerated store opening program, opening 28 new stores this year, increasing our presence around the U.S. and making it even more convenient to shop at JCPenney.
Ullman continued, In 2007, we will build on what we have accomplished in executing our Long Range Plan strategies, with the primary objective of exceeding our customers expectations every time they shop at JCPenney. We started this process with the recent introduction of our new brand positioning, Every Day Matters, through which we will form a deeper, more enduring relationship with our customers.
 
Operating Performance
On a 13-week basis, fourth quarter total department store sales increased 4.1 percent and comparable department store sales increased 2.2 percent. Sales were in line with the Companys guidance for a low-single digit increase, and improved throughout the store and across all regions of the country. The strongest merchandise results were in childrens apparel, fine jewelry and family shoes, and the best regional performances were in the western and northeastern areas of the country. On a 13-week basis, Direct sales decreased 1.2 percent, and Internet sales through sales increased 17.6 percent on top of a 21.8 percent increase in last years quarter.

Gross margin in the quarter improved by 180 basis points to 38.0 percent of sales, reflecting continued benefits from the strong performance of private brands and ongoing improvement in inventory management, including better flow of seasonal goods. The company recorded a LIFO credit of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to a $1 million credit last year. The higher LIFO credit in 2006 was the result of favorable costing coupled with higher inventory levels. Total operating expenses were 26.7 percent of sales in the fourth quarter and reflected the commitment of expense dollars to drive a successful holiday season, costs associated with this years 53 week and operating costs for 28 new stores added during the year. Fourth quarter operating profit was $756 million, a 13.2 percent increase from last years $668 million. For the year, operating profit increased $291 million to $1,922 million, or 9.7 percent of sales.

Real estate and other contributed $4 million of income in this years fourth quarter and reflects the results of normal recurring real estate operations, partially offset by charges associated with the previously announced management transition.
Disclosure Enhancements
Beginning in this years fourth quarter, the Company made two changes to its statement of operations, both designed to enhance the disclosure of its expense structure and provide more clarity on the impact of growth initiatives. Costs associated with the Companys 13 store merchandise distribution centers have now been reclassified from SG&A expenses into cost of goods sold, and depreciation and amortization, as well as pre-opening expenses, have been presented as separate components of operating expenses. These changes had no impact on earnings from continuing operations in the current or prior years. Historical financial statements reflecting the reclassifications, as well as the previously disclosed classification of real estate and other as a component of operating profit, are provided in Attachment 1 (including quarterly restatements for fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2006 and annual restatements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003).
Interest and Taxes
Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million compared with $39 million last year, reflecting the ongoing benefits of higher interest rates on cash investments. The tax rate in this years fourth quarter was 37.2 percent, which was lower than initially anticipated due to the reversal of certain tax reserves.
Discontinued Operations
The Company recognized income of $20 million, net of tax, from discontinued operations in this years fourth quarter, which is principally related to positive variances on tax matters that had been provided for in connection with the sale of previously owned businesses.
Cash Flow and Financial Condition
The Company continues to maintain a strong financial condition. As of Feb. 3, 2007, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion and long-term debt, including current maturities, of $3.4 billion. Merchandise inventories were at planned levels of $3.4 billion, reflecting increases associated with the opening of 28 new stores in 2006 and seven stores that will open in the first quarter of 2007. Cash flows from operating activities exceeded initial guidance by more than $100 million, including the discretionary contribution of $300 million to the Companys pension plan. Full year capital expenditures were $772 million, an increase from
 
 
last year primarily in support of the 28 new store openings, as well as the ongoing execution of the Companys long range plan initiatives.
New FASB Pension Rules
As discussed in the third quarter earnings release, the Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued FAS 158 (Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans), which was effective at year-end 2006. This standard requires recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans directly on the balance sheet.  The Company recorded a decrease in stockholders' equity of $234 million, net of tax, at year-end 2006, as a result of adopting this new rule.  Adoption of FAS 158 impacts the balance sheet only, and has no effect on cash flows or earnings per share in the current or future years.
2007 Earnings Guidance
The following first quarter and full-year guidance is based on managements current expectations for fiscal 2007:
 
New Long Range Plan Targets to be Announced in April
With its strong financial performance in 2006, JCPenney is well ahead of schedule in achieving the objectives it set in the five-year Long Range Plan it introduced in 2005. Accordingly, the Company plans to announce new Long Range Plan initiatives and financial performance goals for the five-year period ending in 2011 at its Analyst Meeting on April 17 and 18.
