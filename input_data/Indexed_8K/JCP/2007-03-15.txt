(1) 2006 Incentive Compensation Awards, 2007 Base Salaries, 2007 Target Incentive Opportunity Percentages, and 2007 Equity Awards.
Pursuant to the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Program (Incentive Program), annual cash incentive compensation is awarded to eligible associates based upon the achievement of pre-set performance goals. For the Companys named executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table of the Companys Proxy Statement, incentive compensation payouts are based (i) 50% on total Company sales and operating profit from continuing operations, and (ii) 50% on the named executive officers individual performance. On March 9, 2007, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (Committee) determined the Incentive Program payment amounts for fiscal 2006 for each of the Companys named executive officers other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as set forth in the table below. The Committee also determined the 2007 base salaries, the 2007 target incentive opportunity percentages under the Incentive Program, and the 2007 equity awards for the Companys named executive officers other than the CEO, which are also set forth in the table below.
Each of these determinations will be discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Companys 2007 proxy statement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on the Companys website.
As previously reported in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 28, 2007, the 2006 Incentive Program payment amount and 2007 compensation arrangements for the CEO were determined by the independent members of the Board of Directors on February 28, 2007.
In addition to the determinations above, the Committee also granted special restricted stock unit awards to Ken C. Hicks and Michael T. Theilmann in the amounts of 19,108 units and 9,554 units, respectively. These awards vest 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date, 25% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, and 25% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.

Employment Termination
If your employment terminates during the Performance Cycle because of Retirement, Disability, death or reduction in force/unit closing, then you shall be entitled to a prorated number of the Performance Units earned in accordance with the Payout Matrix, determined as of the end of the Performance Cycle. The proration shall be based on the ratio of (a) the number of calendar days from the date of grant to the effective date of termination to (b) the total number of calendar days in the vesting period. Any Performance Units earned under this termination provision, shall be immediately vested and delivered in shares of JCPenney Common Stock within 75 days of the end of the Performance Cycle.
If your employment terminates following the end of the Performance Cycle because of Retirement, Disability, death or reduction in force/unit closing, you shall be entitled to a prorated number of the Performance Units earned under the Payout Matrix. The proration shall be based on the ratio of (a) the number of calendar days from the date of grant to the effective date of termination to (b) the total number of calendar days in the vesting period. Any Performance Units that have already vested shall be subtracted from the prorated amount and the remaining prorated Performance Units shall vest immediately and be delivered as shares of JCPenney Common Stock as soon as practicable but in no event later than 75 days following your termination date.

Dividend Equivalents
You shall not have any rights as a stockholder until your Performance Units vest and you are issued shares of Common Stock in cancellation of the vested Performance Units. However, following the conclusion of the Performance Cycle you shall begin to accrue dividend equivalents on the Performance Units credited to your account in the amount of any quarterly dividend declared on the Common Stock. Dividend equivalents shall continue to accrue until your Performance Units vest and you receive actual shares of Common Stock in cancellation of the vested Performance Units. The dividend equivalents shall be credited as additional Performance Units in your account to be paid out in shares of Common Stock on each applicable Vesting Date along with the Performance Units to which they relate. The number of additional Performance Units to be credited to your account shall be determined by dividing the aggregate dividend payable with respect to the number of Performance Units in your account by the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the dividend payment date.

Your withholding rate with respect to this award may not be higher than the minimum statutory rate. The Company shall retain and cancel the number of issued shares equal to the value of the required minimum tax withholding in payment of the required minimum tax withholding due.

The Committees determinations shall be final, conclusive, and binding on you and your heirs, legatees and designees.
