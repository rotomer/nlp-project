First Quarter Highlights
 
PLANO, Texas, May 17, 2007
-- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) reported record earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter ended May 5, 2007. For the quarter, operating income improved 60 basis points to 9.6 percent of sales, driven by improvement in gross margin and SG&A expense leverage. Income from continuing operations for the quarter increased 11.7 percent to $238 million, while earnings per share increased 15.6 percent to $1.04 per share from $0.90 per share in last years first quarter.
The year is off to a strong start at JCPenney. This in part reflects the early benefits of our enhanced merchandise flow capabilities, which allow us to present newness in our assortments and reduce clearance levels, as well as the recent introduction of our private lingerie brand Ambrielle and exclusive Liz & Co. and CONCEPTS by Claiborne lines. Based on our first quarter performance, we have increased our earnings guidance for the full year, said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman III, chairman and chief executive officer of JCPenney.
At its April Analyst Meeting, the Company introduced its 2007 to 2011 Long-Range Plan which is designed to build on the strengths that set JCPenney apart in the industry. The Plan is
 
 
focused on
 
developing a deep and enduring emotional connection with customers, inspiring them with merchandise and services, becoming the preferred choice for a retail career, and establishing JCPenney as the growth leader in the retail industry. 
Our merchandise offerings, and the plans we have for new brands and merchandise concepts such as American Living, reflect what we learn from listening to our customers. This provides us with an exceptional mix of private, exclusive and national brands, and combined with our unique positioning on- and off-mall and industry leading Internet presence, enables us to offer our customers great style and quality, at a smart price. These are key differentiators for JCPenney that underscore our confidence to deliver the Companys long-range targets, Ullman added.
Operating Performance
During the first quarter, total department store sales increased 4.4 percent. Total store sales reflect 32 new or relocated stores opened subsequent to first quarter last year, including seven stores opened in this years first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 2.2 percent and were in line with the Companys guidance for a low-single digit increase, despite a challenging retail environment for much of the quarter. The strongest merchandise results were in womens apparel, fine jewelry and womens accessories, with continued softness in home categories such as furniture and window coverings. All regions of the country generated sales gains in the first quarter, with the best performances in the northwestern and southwestern regions. Internet sales through

increased approximately 18 percent on top of a 22 percent increase in last years first quarter, while total Direct sales, including print and outlet stores, decreased 3.6 percent.
Gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 41.5 percent of sales, which reflects good customer response to spring merchandise assortments, especially private apparel brands, continued benefits from the Companys planning and allocation technology and processes, and initial benefits from the Companys cycle time reduction initiative. SG&A expenses were leveraged by 20 basis points to 29.7 percent of sales. Including the impacts of depreciation and amortization expense, pre-opening expenses and income from ongoing real estate operations, total operating expenses were 31.9 percent of sales in the quarter. First quarter operating income was $419 million, a 9.7 percent increase from last years $382 million.
 
 
 
Interest and Taxes
Interest expense for the quarter was $32 million compared with $34 million last year, and the tax rate was 38.5 percent, both of which were in line with previously announced guidance.
Liquidity and Financial Condition
The Company continues to maintain a strong financial condition. As of May 5, 2007, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $3.1 billion and long-term debt, including current maturities, of $4.1 billion. On April 27, 2007, the Company successfully completed a $1 billion debt offering. The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the early redemption on June 1, 2007, of the remaining $303 million principal amount of its 8.125 percent Debentures due 2027. The balance of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of 2007 and 2008 long-term debt maturities.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $244 million, in line with expectations, with the majority of spending related to the construction of new stores and the renovation of existing stores.
Merchandise inventories were at planned levels of $3.5 billion, reflecting increases associated with 32 new stores opened since last years first quarter, including seven in the first quarter this year, and the planned opening of 15 additional new stores in the second quarter.
