2007 Highlights
 
 
PLANO, Texas, Feb. 21, 2008
-- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) reported operating income of $729 million and earnings from continuing operations of $1.93 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating income as a percent of sales increased slightly in the quarter, although on a dollar basis it declined compared to last years 14-week fourth quarter. For the quarter, the impact of gross margin pressure resulting from a weak consumer spending environment was more than offset by effective control of operating expenses. For the full year, operating income was $1,888 million, or 9.5 per cent of sales, and earnings from continuing operations were $4.90 per share. Net income for this years fourth quarter and full year, including the impact of discontinued operations, was $1.93 and $4.93 per share, respectively.
I am proud of what our team accomplished in 2007, said Myron E. (Mike) Ullman III, chairman and chief executive officer of JCPenney. Our ability to manage the business through difficult retail conditions is a tribute to our Associates around the country and validates the Long-Range Plan initiatives we have been implementing to become the retail industry leader in performance and execution.
With no clear indication that the consumer environment will improve during 2008, we have taken a conservative approach to planning our business to maintain a balance between near-term economic realities and our long-term growth opportunities. To this end, we will remain focused on improving the customer experience in our stores and providing exciting, stylish merchandise at smart prices that will resonate well with our customers during this period. This approach will be seen in our new American Living concept and other launches we have planned over the course of the year. At the same time, we are taking prudent actions to grow our competitive market share with 36 new store openings under a moderated capital expenditure plan while remaining vigilant about managing both SG&A and inventory levels.
Operating Performance
Total sales in the fourth quarter decreased 4.1 percent compared to last years 14-week period, while comparable store sales decreased 2.3 percent. The strongest merchandise results were in womens and childrens apparel, and, geographically, the best performance was in the northwest region of the country. Internet sales through
jcp.com
continue to represent our fastest growing channel increasing 13.7 percent on a 13-week basis. The weakest performances were in fine jewelry and big-ticket home categories and in the southeast region of the country.
For the quarter, operating income as a percent of sales improved 10 basis points to 11.4 percent. Gross margin declined 180 basis points to 36.2 percent of sales and reflected pressure from a weak sales environment that led to increased promotional levels and in-season clearance activities. SG&A expenses were well-managed in the quarter, decreasing 11.3 percent from last years 14-week fourth quarter. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses improved 190 basis points to 24.8 percent of sales in the fourth quarter and benefited primarily from lower salary and related costs.
Interest expense for the quarter was $43 million, which was in line with initial expectations, and the effective tax rate was 37.2 percent.
Cash Flow and Financial Condition
The Company maintained its strong financial condition, with the flexibility to continue to support long-term growth initiatives. As of Feb. 2, 2008, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion and long-term debt, including $200 million of current maturities, of $3.7 billion. Merchandise inventories totaled $3.6 billion and were consistent with Company expectations, including levels of clearance merchandise. Inventory at the end of the year
reflects increases associated with the opening of 50 new stores in 2007 and 10 stores that will open in the first quarter of 2008, as well as the launch of American Living across 40 merchandise categories. Including merchandise to support the American Living launch, comparable store inventories increased about two percent. For the year, cash flows from operating activities decreased compared to 2006, while full year capital expenditures were $1.2 billion, in line with expectations and higher than last year as a result of the accelerated new store program.
