Description
99.1                                  J. C. Penney Company, Inc. News Release issued May 7, 2009

Exhibit 99.1
-- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) comparable store sales decreased 6.6 percent for the four weeks ended May 2, 2009, better than the Companys guidance for sales to decrease 9 to 12 percent and compared to a 1.7 percent decrease last year.    Total sales in April decreased 5.0 percent.
PLANO, Texas, May 7, 2009
Sales during the month benefited from the shift of Easter into the April reporting period this year, partially offset by the loss of one selling day.   The top performing merchandise divisions during the month were womens and childrens apparel, reflecting a strong customer response to the Companys spring apparel offerings.  Fine jewelry experienced the weakest sales during the month.  Geographically, the best performing region of the country was the southwest while the central region experienced the weakest results.
 
 
 
Managements guidance for the four-week period ending May 30, 2009, is for a 9 to 12 percent decrease in comparable store sales, compared to a 4.4 percent decrease in last years May period.  Expectations for May sales reflect recognition of the difficult comparisons to last years second quarter sales performance.
 
 
 
 
 
Based on better-than-expected sales results in the April period, operational efficiencies achieved through process improvements and a consistent focus on expense control, management expects earnings for the first quarter to be in a range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.
