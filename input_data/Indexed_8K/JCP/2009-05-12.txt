99.1                                                J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Press Release dated May 12, 2009

Exhibit 99.1
 
 J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) announced today that it and its wholly owned subsidiary, J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc., have accepted for purchase $104,440,000 principal amount of outstanding 8 percent Notes due March 1, 2010 (CUSIP No. 708130AA7), which were validly tendered pursuant to the previously announced cash tender offer to purchase up to $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes.  The offer expired at 11:59 p.m., EDT, on May 11, 2009.  Pursuant to the full terms and conditions of the offer as set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated April 14, 2009, the Company has accepted for purchase all validly tendered Notes not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration date.
PLANO, Texas, May 12, 2009
The aggregate consideration for the Notes accepted for purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, is $107,150,280 and is expected to be paid on May 13, 2009.  Holders of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn on or before 5:00 p.m., EDT, on April 27, 2009, will receive $1,010 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.  Holders of Notes validly tendered after 5:00 p.m., EDT on April 27, 2009 and prior to the expiration date will receive $980 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.
By using cash on hand to repurchase and retire this debt early, the Company expects to reduce its interest expense for 2009 by approximately $4 million.  This amount is net of fees associated with this offer.
The successful completion of our debt tender offer will reduce interest expense and further exemplifies JCPenneys commitment to improving the Companys capital structure, stated Robert Cavanaugh, executive vice president and chief financial officer.  We believe that the level of participation in the offer reflects the confidence that the investment community places on our financial strength and flexibility to support our long-range plan for industry growth and leadership.
Barclays Capital Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as dealer managers for the tender offer.  D.F. King & Co., Inc. acted as Information Agent and Depositary for the tender offer.
