Mr. Hicks, 56, has held his current position at JCPenney since 2005. He joined the Company in 2002 as president and chief operating officer of JCPenneys stores and merchandise operations, after having served as president of Payless ShoeSource, Inc. (now known as Collective Brands, Inc.). He is also a member of JCPenneys Board of Directors, and will resign from that position on July 6th.
Through Kens strong merchandising and marketing leadership, we have solidified our position in the hearts and minds of millions of customers across the country as the shopping destination for great style and quality at very affordable prices, said Mr. Ullman.  JCPenneys Board of Directors and Associates are grateful for Kens dedicated service and contributions to JCPenneys success and wish him the best of luck in his new position. We have a strong leadership team in place and look forward to adding to it in the near future with a worthy successor to Ken.
Mr. Hicks said, It has been a tremendous privilege to have worked with the great retail team at JCPenney to reclaim its leadership position within the industry.  While I am very excited about my new opportunity, I am proud of the strong position that JCPenney is now in for its future success.
