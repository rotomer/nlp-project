Exhibit 99.1
 
 J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) reported comparable store sales for the four-week period ended Aug. 1, 2009 and raised its earnings guidance for the second quarter.  Comparable store sales in July decreased 12.3 percent, slightly better than the Companys guidance for sales to decrease 13 to 16 percent.  Total Company sales in July decreased 10.6 percent.  Sales during the month were impacted by a combination of a later start to the Back-to-School selling period and the shift of several state tax-free shopping periods into this years fiscal August, as well as by lower levels of clearance inventory relative to last year.  In last years July period, comparable store sales decreased 6.5 percent.  
PLANO, Texas (Aug. 6, 2009)
 
Womens apparel and womens accessories were the top performing merchandise divisions in July.  Childrens apparel was the weakest performer and was impacted by lower levels of clearance merchandise when compared to the same period last year.  The southwest region was the best performing region in July, while the southeast region had the softest sales performance during the month.
 
During the July period, the Company launched Schooled in Style: Smart Looks for Less, an innovative, integrated marketing campaign for the 2009 Back-to-School Season.  The campaign showcases recently launched brands RS By Sheckler, Rusty, and Third Rail a Zoo York Production and private brand Decree for young men, along with JCPenneys other desired teen brands like Levis and Decree for juniors.  The Companys distinctive assortment of teen brands make it clear that even as JCPenney steps up its style, parents and teens can continue to depend on JCPenney for great quality and prices.
 
The Company opened five new stores at the end of July, including the opening of its first-ever department store in Manhattan and its first store expected to obtain LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification located in Fairview, Texas.  The Company also added 23
 
 
 
 
 
Sephora inside JCPenney locations in both new and existing stores bringing the total number of locations to 143, with 12 more planned to open by the end of 2009.
 
 
August Sales Outlook and Updated Second Quarter Earnings Guidance
 
Managements guidance for the four-week period ending Aug. 29, 2009, is for a 6 to 9 percent decrease in comparable store sales, compared to a 4.9 percent decrease in last years August period.  August sales guidance takes into account the shift of several state tax-free shopping events from the July period into the August period, as well as the shift of Labor Day weekend shopping into the September reporting period.
 
Based on better than expected sales in July and continued improvement in gross margin and operating expenses, management now expects to report a second quarter loss of approximately $0.01 per share.  This compares to the Companys most recent guidance for a loss in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 per share.
