Item 3.03                      Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
 
On October 15, 2010, the Board of Directors of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the Company) declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of Common Stock of 50 par value of the Company (the Common Stock). The dividend is payable to holders of record as of the close of business on October 25, 2010 and is payable in respect of each share of Common Stock upon certification by the New York Stock Exchange to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Rights have been approved for listing and registration. The specific terms of the Rights are contained in the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2010 (the Rights Agreement), by and between the Company and Mellon Investor Services, LLC, as Rights Agen t.
 
The Board of Directors authorized the adoption of the Rights Agreement, which has a one-year term, to promote fair and equal treatment of the Companys stockholders in connection with any initiative to acquire control of the Company and in light of recent rapid accumulations of a significant percentage of the Common Stock. In general terms, the Rights restrict  any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, or, in the case of any person or group that owns 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock on the date of announcement of the Companys entry into the Rights Agreement, any additional shares of Common Stock. The Company, its subsidiaries, employee benefit plans of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any entity holding Common Stock for or pu rsuant to the terms of any such plan, are excepted. In addition, any person or group who becomes the owner of 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock solely as a result of a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to any repurchase of shares by the Company would be permitted to acquire up to an additional 1% of the outstanding Common Stock. Finally, any person or group who, in connection with an agreement to merge with or acquire the Company, receives an option to acquire shares of Common Stock would be excepted. Any person or group who acquires shares of Common Stock in violation of these limitations is known as an Acquiring Person. For purposes of the Rights Agreement, beneficial ownership is defined to include ownership of options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights, swap agreements or other securities, contract rights or derivative positions, whether or not presently exercisable.
 
The Rights will not prevent a takeover of the Company, but may cause substantial dilution to a person that acquires 10% or more of the Common Stock.
 
Following is a summary of the terms of the Rights Agreement. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Rights Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
. The Rights will initially trade with, and will be inseparable from, the Common Stock. The Rights will not be evidenced by separate certificates until they become exercisable. As long as the Rights are attached to the Common Stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of Common Stock so that each share of Common Stock will have a Right attached.
The Rights
 
Each Right will allow its holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of participating preferred stock (a Preferred Share) for $130 (or, in certain cases, securities of certain other entities), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement, once the Rights become exercisable. This portion of a Preferred Share will give the stockholder approximately
Exercise Price.
 
the same dividend, voting, and liquidation rights as would one share of Common Stock. Prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or liquidation rights.
 
. The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and become exercisable at the close of business on the 10th business day (or such later date as the Board of Directors may fix) following:
Exercisability
 
 
 
 
The date when the Rights become exercisable is referred to as the Separation Time. After that date, the Rights will separate from the Common Stock and be evidenced by book-entry credits or by Rights certificates that the Rights Agent will mail to all eligible holders of Common Stock.
 
.
Consequences of a Person or Group Becoming an Acquiring Person
 
. Prior to the expiration of the Rights, upon the earlier of (i) the first date of a public announcement by the Company that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, or (ii) the date on which any Acquiring Person beneficially owns more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock, each Right will constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon the exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement, that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price (as defined in the Rights Agreement) equal to twice the then-current Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then-current Exercise Price. On such date, any Rights that are beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person (and such Acquiring Persons affil iates or associates and, in each case, any transferee thereof) will become null and void.
Flip-in Feature
 
. Prior to the expiration of the Rights, if there exists an Acquiring Person that controls the Board of Directors or beneficially owns 90% or more of the Common Stock, and the Company is involved in (i) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange (or enters into an agreement to undertake any of the foregoing) and either (a) such merger, consolidation or share exchange is with the Acquiring Person or any of its affiliates or associates, or (b) any term of such merger, consolidation or share exchange relating to the treatment of capital stock of the Company that is beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person is not identical to the terms of such transaction relating to capital stock that is beneficially owned by other holders, or (ii) a sale of more tha n 50% of the Companys assets or earning power (each, a Flip-over Transaction or Event), each Right will constitute the right to purchase from the resulting entity, upon exercise of such Right in accordance with the Rights Agreement, that number of shares of common stock of such entity having an aggregate Market Price equal to twice the then-current Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then-current Exercise Price.
Flip-over Feature
 
.
Preferred Share Provisions
 
Each one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, if issued:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
. After a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, but before an Acquiring Person owns 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, the Board of Directors may extinguish the Rights by exchanging one share of Common Stock or an equivalent security for each Right, other than Rights held by the Acquiring Person.
Exchange
 
. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights for $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the Separation Time. The redemption price may, at the option of the Company, be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. If the Board of Directors redeems any Rights, it must redeem all of the Rights. Once the Rights are redeemed, holders of Rights will only be entitled to receive the redemption price of $0.01 per Right. The redemption price will be adjusted in the event of a stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Common Stock.
Redemption
 
. The Rights will generally expire on October 14, 2011. By a two-thirds vote of the independent directors, the Board of Directors can extend the expiration of the Rights for up to one year.
Expiration
 
. The Board shall have the right to adjust, among other things, the Exercise Price, as well as the number of Preferred Shares issuable, and the number of outstanding Rights to prevent dilution that may occur from a stock dividend, a stock split, or a reclassification of the Preferred Shares or Common Stock.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
 
. The terms of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board of Directors prior to the Separation Time without the consent of the holders of the Rights. The Board of Directors may not amend the Rights Agreement after the Separation Time in a way that adversely affects the holders of the Rights.

Certificates for the Common Stock issued (whether originally issued or from the Company's treasury) on or after the Payment Time but prior to the Separation Time shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock represented thereby and shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them substantially the following legend:
 
13
 
 
 
 
Until the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights Agreement referred to below), this certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2010 (as such may be amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement"), between J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the "Company") and Mellon Investor Services, LLC, as Rights Agent, the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of the Company. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights may be redeemed, may become exercisable for securities or assets of the Company or securities of another entity, may be exchanged for shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets of the Company, may expire, may become null and void (including, if they are "Beneficially Owned" by an "Acquiring Person" or an "Affiliate" or "Associate" thereof (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement, or by any transferee of any of the foregoing)) or may be evidenced by separate certificates and may no longer be evidenced by this certificate. The Company will mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of the Rights Agreement to the holder of this certificate without charge after the receipt of a written request therefor.
 
 
Certificates representing shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding at the Payment Time shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock evidenced thereby notwithstanding the absence of the foregoing legend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the omission of a legend nor the inclusion of a legend that makes reference to a rights agreement other than the Agreement shall affect the enforceability of any part of this Agreement or the rights of any holder of Rights.
If the Common Stock issued after the Payment Time but prior to the Separation Time shall be uncertificated, the registration of such Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock represented thereby. The Company shall mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of this Agreement to any Person that holds Common Stock, as evidenced by the registration of the Common Stock in the name of such Person on the stock transfer books of the Company, without charge after the receipt of a written request therefor, and the Company shall cause the transfer agent for the Common Stock
 
14
 
 
 
 
to include on each direct registration account statement with respect to the Common Stock issued prior to the Separation Time an appropriate notation to the reflect the issuance of the Rights.

Exercise of Rights; Separation of Rights
. (a) Subject to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10 and subject to adjustment as herein set forth, each Right will entitle the holder thereof, at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, to purchase, for the Exercise Price, one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock.
(b)
 
Until the Separation Time, (i) no Right may be exercised and (ii) each Right will be evidenced by the certificate for the associated share of Common Stock (or, if the Common Stock shall be uncertificated, by the registration of the associated Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company and the confirmation thereof provided for in Section 2.2), and will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer (whether with or without such letter or confirmation) of, such associated share.
(c)
 
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised pursuant to Section 2.3(d) below and (ii) may be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock. Promptly following the Separation Time (provided that the Board of Directors of the Company has not elected to exchange all of the then outstanding Rights pursuant to Section 3.1(c)), then the Rights Agent or the transfer agent for the Common Stock, if requested by the Company and provided with the necessary information, will mail to each holder of record of Common Stock as of the Separation Time (other than any Person whose Rights have become null and void purs uant to Section 3.1(b)), at such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company (and the Company hereby agrees to furnish copies of such records to the Rights Agent for this purpose), (x) a certificate (a "Rights Certificate") in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto appropriately
 
15
 
 
 
 
completed, representing the number of Rights held by such holder at the Separation Time and having such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and as do not affect the rights, liabilities, responsibilities or duties of the Rights Agent, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock or the Rights may from time to time be listed or traded ("Trading Regulation"), or to conform to usage, and (y) a disclosure statement describing the Rights;
provided, , that the Company shall have no obligation to distribute Rights Certificates to any Acquiring Person or Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any of the foregoing. Receipt of a Rights Certificate by any Person shall not preclude a later determination that such Rights are null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b). To the extent applicable, the Company may implement such procedures as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to minimize the possibility that Rights are received by Persons with respect to whom Rights would be null and void under Section 3.1(b).

(d)
 
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Rights may be exercised on any Business Day at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time by submitting to the Rights Agent the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise") substantially in the form attached to the Rights Certificate duly executed and properly completed, accompanied by payment in cash, or by certified or official bank check or money order payable to the order of the Company, of a sum equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Rights being exercised and a sum sufficient to cover any tax or charge that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in t he transfer or delivery of

(g)
 
The Company covenants and agrees that it will (i) take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares delivered (or evidenced by registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery (or registration) of such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered (or registered) and fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary to comply with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection wit h the issuance of any shares upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or charge that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery (or registration) of shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being transferred or exercised.

Each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as of the payment or effective date for the applicable dividend, subdivision or combination.
19
 
 
 
 
In the event that the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue any shares of Common Stock otherwise than in a transaction referred to in the preceding paragraph, each such share of Common Stock so issued shall automatically have one new Right associated with it, which Right shall be evidenced by the certificate representing such share (or, if the Common Stock shall be uncertificated, such Right shall be evidenced by the registration of such Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company and the confirmation thereof provided for in Section 2.2). Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time only to the extent provided in Section 5.3.
(b)

20
 
 
 
 
such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, and (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with the transfer agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment or statement therein contained and shall have no duty or liability with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of, any adjustment or any such event unless and until it shall have received such a certificate.
(d)
 
Rights Certificates shall represent the right to purchase the securities purchasable under the terms of this Agreement, including any adjustment or change in the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.
2.5
  
Date on Which Exercise is Effective
. Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or registration on the stock transfer books is effected) upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration) shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.

The Rights Agent is hereby appointed "Rights Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the Rights Register for the Company and registering Rights and transfers of Rights after the Separation Time as herein provided. In the event that the Rights
 
22

After the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, upon surrender for registration of transfer or exchange of any Rights Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.7(c) and (d), the Company will execute, and the Rights Agent will countersign and, if requested and provided with all necessary information, deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holder's instructions, one or more new Rights Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so surrendered.
(b)

As a condition to the issuance of any new Rights Certificate under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation under any section of this Agreement that requires the payment of taxes or charges unless and until it is satisfied that all such taxes and/or charges have been paid.
 
23
 
 
 
 
(d)

Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Rights Certificates
. (a) If any mutilated Rights Certificate is surrendered to the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 5.1, the Company shall execute and the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange therefor a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so surrendered.
(b)
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Rights Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any of their agents harmless, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 5.1 and in the absence of written notice to the Company or the Rights Agent that such Rights Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Rights Agent shall countersign and, if requested and provided with all necessary information, deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate, a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so destroyed, lost or stolen.

(d)

24
 
 
 
 
 
obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and, subject to Section 3.1(b) shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Rights duly issued hereunder.

prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer of, the associated share of Common Stock;
(b)
 
as of and after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein;
(c)
 
prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;
(d)
 
Rights that are Beneficially Owned by certain Persons will, under the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become null and void;
(e)
 
this Agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to time in accordance with its terms;

3.1
  
Flip-in
. (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date shall occur, except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.10), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock Acquisition Date any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock). The foregoing notwithstanding,
 
27
 
 
 
 
Rights shall not be exercisable pursuant to this Section 3.1 unless and until the Separation Time shall have occurred.
(b)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are or were Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof, (ii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in such Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acq uiring Person has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, regarding the transferred Rights, or (B) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this Section 3.1(b), shall become null and void and any holder of such Rights (including transferees, whether direct or indirect, of any such Persons) shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. If any Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the end of the Form of Assignment or Form of Notice of Election to Exercise or, if requested, will not provide such additional evidence, including, without limitation, the identity of the Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates and As sociates) as the Company shall reasonably request in order to determine if such Rights are null and void, then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Rights to be Beneficially Owned by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or
 
28
 
 
 
 
Associate thereof or a transferee of any of the foregoing and accordingly will deem the Rights evidenced thereby to be null and void and not transferable, exercisable or exchangeable. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to insure that the provisions of this Section 3.1(b) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Rights or any other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or any of its Affiliates, Associates or their respective transferees hereunder.
(c)
 
The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than all) of the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of holders of Rights generally in the event that after the Separation Time any of the eve nts described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with
 
29
 
 
 
 
such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the Company shall give written notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. Following the action of the Board of Director s ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c), the Company may implement such procedures as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, for the purpose of ensuring that the Common Stock (or such other consideration) issuable upon an exchange pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) is not received by holders of Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b). Before effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 3.1(c), the Board of Directors may direct the Company to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board of Directors shall then approve (the "Trust Agreement"). If the Board of Directors so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "Trust") all or a portion (as designated by the Board of Directors) of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all holders of Rights entitled to receive such shares or securities pursuant t o the exchange shall be entitled to receive such shares or securities (and any dividends paid or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited in the Trust) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement. Prior to effecting an exchange and registering shares of Common Stock (or other such securities) in any Person's name, including any nominee or transferee of a Person, the
provided
however
 
30
 
 
 
 
Company may require (or cause the trustee of the Trust to require), as a condition thereof, that any holder of Rights provide evidence, including, without limitation, the identity of the Beneficial Owners thereof and their Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners thereof and their Affiliates and Associates) as the Company shall reasonably request in order to determine if such Rights are null and void. If any Person shall fail to comply with such request, the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Rights formerly held by such Person to be null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and not transferable or exerciseable or exchangeable in connection herewith. Any shares of Common Stock or other securities issued at the direction of the Board in connection herewith shall be validly issued, fu lly paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock or of such other securities (as the case may be), and the Company shall be deemed to have received as consideration for such issuance a benefit having a value that is at least equal to the aggregate par value of the shares so issued.
Each Person in whose name any certificate for such shares is issued (or for whom any registration on the stock transfer books of the Company is made) upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to Section 3.1(c) or (d) shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on, and such certificate (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered) as of, the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly exchanged (or deemed exchanged by the Company) and payment of any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the holder was made; , , that if the date of such exchange and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration on the
provided
however
 
31
 
 
 
 
stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered) as of the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
(d)

EXHIBIT B
 
 
 
 
 
We, the undersigned, ____________ and ____________, ____________ and _______, respectively, of J. C. Penney Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify as follows:
Pursuant to authority granted by Article FOURTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has adopted the following resolutions fixing the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of a new series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock, no par value, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon:
 
RESOLVED, that there is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
 
 
(i)
 
The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii)
 
The number of shares in this Series shall initially be [2,400,000], which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one one-hundredth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a ho lder of a whole share of this Series.
1
 
 
(iii)
 
The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package, and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of a dollar amount equal to 0.25% of $[] over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued, that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
2
provided
 
 
The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.50 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation. In
 
2
 
 
 
 
the event the Corporation shall at any time after []: (A) declare or pay a dividend on any Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (B) subdivide any Common Stock or (C) combine any Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then and in each such case the Reference Package after such event shall be the Common Stock that a holder of the Reference Package immediately prior to such event would hold thereafter as a result thereof.
3
 
 
Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
 
 
So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share on this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously b e, paid.
 
 
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
 
 
(iv)
 
In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
 
 
(v)
 
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of (A) $[] or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed in connection with such liquidation, dissol ution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
5
 
 
In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts to which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
 
 
   
  
   
   
  
 
4
 
 
 
Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v) before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
 
 
For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation or entity shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
 
 
(vi)
 
The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
 
 
(vii)
 
In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as may be amended from time to time, of the Corporation, and except as otherwise required by law, each share (or fraction thereof) of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed and attested this certificate on the ___ day of _______, 20__.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE: JCP) announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement (Rights Plan) and declared a dividend of one right on each outstanding share of the Companys common stock.
PLANO, Texas (Oct. 18, 2010) 
The Companys Board of Directors is committed to acting in the best interests of all its stockholders. The Board adopted the Rights Plan, which has a term of one year, to promote fair and equal treatment of JCPenneys stockholders in connection with any initiative to acquire control of the Company and in light of recent rapid accumulations of a significant percentage of the Companys outstanding common stock.
Each right entitles the holder to purchase a fraction of a share of JCPenney participating preferred stock having economic and voting terms similar to the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $130.00 per right.  Under the Rights Plan, the rights become exercisable if any person or group acquires 10 percent or more of JCPenneys common stock or, in the case of any person or group that currently owns 10 percent or more of the common stock, upon the acquisition of additional shares by such person or group.  Until the rights become exercisable, they will not be evidenced by separate certificates and will trade automatically with shares of the Companys common stock. The rights will expire on Oct. 14, 2011.
Barclays Capital Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are serving as financial advisors and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal advisor to the Company.
