Description
99.1                                  J. C. Penney Company, Inc. News Release issued February 3, 2011

   
   
   
   
   
 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
-- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) reported today that its comparable store sales for the four-week period ended Jan. 29, 2011, decreased 1.2 percent.   After strong sales during the first two months of the quarter, which resulted in quarterly sales coming in above the Companys expectations, January sales were impacted by lower levels of clearance inventory when compared to the same period last year, as well as by adverse weather conditions.
PLANO, Texas, Feb. 3, 2011
 
Geographically, the Companys best performing regions were the southwest and northwest, compared to the northeast and southeast regions where winter storms affected sales and traffic trends throughout the month of January.
 
Overall, womens apparel and accessories were the top performing merchandise divisions in January.  Sales of Liz Claiborne apparel and accessories continued to perform ahead of expectations, attracting new and existing customers to JCPenney.  Sephora inside JCPenney also continued to attract new customers this month, with more shoppers discovering the unique beauty experience offered within the Sephora inside JCPenney boutiques.  This performance reflects the success of the Companys focus on enhancing the center core of its stores to provide both style and value for modern customers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth Quarter Earnings Outlook Increased
 
Due to the better than expected overall sales performance during the quarter, coupled with gross margin performance that was in-line with expectations and rigorous expense management that resulted in expenses being well-leveraged against sales, the Company now expects fourth quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.09 per share, including the previously announced one-time restructuring charges of approximately $0.08 per share. Management had previously provided guidance for fourth quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00 per share.
 
The Company will report its results for the 2010 fourth quarter and full year prior to the opening of the market on Feb. 25, 2011, and management will host a live conference call and real-time webcast beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET to discuss the Companys results, as well as provide details about expectations for 2011, including guidance for the first quarter.
