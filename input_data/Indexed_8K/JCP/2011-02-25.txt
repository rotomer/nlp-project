In connection with its proposed $900 million share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the Company) entered into separate stockholders agreements (the Stockholders Agreements) on February 24, 2011 with each of (i) Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., in its capacity as investment advisor to certain funds, and its controlled affiliates (collectively, Pershing Square), and (ii) Vornado Realty Trust and its controlled affiliates (collectively, Vornado, and, together with Pershing Square, the Stockholders).  As described in the Stockholders Agreements, in the absence of participation by the Stockholders in the Share Repurchase, the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock of 50 par value of the Company (Common Stock) beneficially owned by the Stockholders as of the date of the Stockholders Agreements will increase.  Accordingly, each of the Stockholders Agreements provides that, with respect to any meeting of the Companys stockholders, Pershing Square or Vornado, respectively, will cause the number of shares of Common Stock as to which it possesses the power to vote (or direct the voting of) in excess of 16.5% or 9.9%, respectively (but in no event more shares than the Excess Shares Number), to be present for quorum purposes and to be voted at such meeting either (a) as recommended by the Companys Board of Directors or (b) in direct proportion to the manner in which all stockholders (other than the Stockholders) vote. As used in the Stockholders Agreements, the Excess Shares Number means the number of shares of Common Stock equal to (A) the product of 16.5% or 9.9%, respectively, and the number of shares of Common Stock acquired in the Share Repurchase, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock sold or otherwise transferred by Pershing Square or Vornado, respectively, after the date of the Stockholders Agreements.  The Stockholders Agreements also provide that Pershing Square or Vornado, respectively, will not transfer or otherwise dispose of more than the (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock it beneficially owns at the time of such transfer that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Excess Shares Number, and (y) 16.5% or 9.9%, respectively, of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock; unless, in each case, the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.  The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stockholders Agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
