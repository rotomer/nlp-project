 meeting.  For business to be properly requested to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, any stockholder who desires to bring any matter (other than the election of directors, which is provided for in Section 15 of Article III of these Bylaws) before such meeting and who is entitled to vote on such matter must give timely written notice of such stockholder's desire to bring such matter before the meeting, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Company not later than 90 days in advance of such meeting.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary in this regard shall set forth: (1) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business, (2) a representation that such stockholder is a record owner of stock of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person at the meeting to present the described business, (3) a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and (4) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.  Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business may be conducted at a meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II of these Bylaws.  The chairman of a meeting may, if the facts warrant, or if not in accordance with applicable law, determine and declare to the meeting that business proposed to be brought before a meeting was not a proper subject therefor or was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7, and if he should so determine, he may so declare to the meeting, and any such
 
 
 
 
 
8
business not a proper subject matter or not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
SECTION 8.  .  Except as otherwise provided in the laws of the State of Delaware or the certificate of incorporation, at every meeting of stockholders, each stockholder of the Company shall be entitled to one vote at the meeting in person or by proxy for each share of stock having voting rights registered in his or her name on the books of the Company on the date fixed pursuant to Section 3 of Article VII of these Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.  Shares of its own stock belonging to the Company shall not be voted directly or indirectly (except for shares of stock held by the Company i n a fiduciary capacity).  The vote of any stockholder entitled thereto may be cast in person or by his or her proxy appointed by an instrument in writing, or by other means of electronic transmission, to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  At all meetings of stockholders, each question (except as otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, these Bylaws or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company, or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Company and its securities) shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.  In any non-
Voting; Proxies; Ballots

contested election of directors, each director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that directors election.  Any director nominee who is an incumbent director and is not re-elected shall, promptly following the receipt of the final report from the independent inspectors of election, tender his or her resignation, and the Board of Directors (excluding the director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this Section 8) shall decide whether to accept or refuse the resignation promptly.  Absent a compelling reason as determined by the other directors in the exercise of their business judgment for the director to remain on the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall accept the resignation.   In a contested election (as defined in Section II.H of the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines), directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the stockholder meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors and shall not be required to tender any such resignation.  If the Board of Directors accepts a director's resignation pursuant to this Section 8, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 13 of Article III of these Bylaws, or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these Bylaws.  All elections of directors and all votes on matters set forth in the notice of meeting shall be by written

On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted.
SECTION 9.  .  The Company shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Company, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.  The Company may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
Inspectors of Election
The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall(i) ascertain the number of shares of stock of the Company outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of stock of the Company represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their
 
 
 
 
11
determination of the number of shares of stock of the Company represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.  Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law.  In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Company, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
