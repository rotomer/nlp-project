The Credit Agreement generally contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.  In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, each lender who was a party to the prior agreement has waived any default under the prior agreement arising from the failure of the Loan Parties to comply with the restrictive covenant on restricted payments.
No borrowings, other than the issuance of trade and stand-by letters of credit, which totaled approximately $197.1 million at closing, have been made under the Credit Agreement.  The proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, if any, are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes.   The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 29, 2016; however, the Corporation, with the consent of lenders constituting more than 50% of the total commitments under the Credit Agreement, may extend the maturity date for up to two additional one-year terms.  Certain of the lenders who are parties to the Credit Agreement provide commercial banking, investment banking, trustee and custodial services to the Company.

The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) or such other standard of care as shall be separately agreed to in writing by such Issuing Bank and the applicable Account Party, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing (or, in respect of the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement under Section 2.05(e), such Lenders Participation Amount), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share (or such Lenders Participation Amount, as applicable) available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing (or such Lenders Participation Amount, as applicable) available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable) severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower (or such Issuing Bank, as applicable) to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If (x) with respect to such Borrowing, such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing or (y) with respect to such reimbursement of such LC Disbursement, the applicable Account Party shall reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement before the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank reimburses the Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, then the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive or retain the amount due to it as provided above together with interest payable by such Account Party with respect to the period commencing on the date that the Administrative Agent funded its payment to the applicable Issuing Bank.

Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto or otherwise in a form reasonably approved by the Administrative Agent and, in each case, signed by such Borrower.

(ii)
 
the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay its Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will any Issuing Bank or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party the payment of which would place the Issuing Bank or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Bank or such Lender would have been if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This Section shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other Person.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or a Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower or any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) in the amount of such participation.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower or an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent from such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)
 
all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments (it being understood that in no event shall any non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure exceed such Lenders Commitment as a result of such reallocation) and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)
 
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers or the Account Parties shall within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)

sole discretion, otherwise provide credit support for) such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)
 
if the Borrower
s or the Account Parties cash collateralize, or otherwise provide credit support for, any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized or otherwise has credit support provided therefor;
 
(iv)
 
if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v)
 
if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized, nor otherwise has credit support provided therefor nor is reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized, otherwise has credit support provided therefor and/or is reallocated;
 
(d)
 
so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender
, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral (or other credit support, if approved by each applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion) will be provided by the Borrowers or the Account Parties in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders
shall not participate therein); and
 
(e)
 
2.17(c),
any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
but excluding Section 2.18(b)) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account (which may be invested as requested by the Parent Borrower, at the Parent Borrowers risk and expense, subject to approval by the Administrative Agent) and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder, (iii) third, as the Parent
 
 
 
 
55
Borrower may request (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) to the funding of any Loan or the funding or cash collateralization of any participating interest in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement (such amounts to be determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Parent Borrower), (iv) fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers or the Account Parties, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender under this Agreement, (v) fifth, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers, the Account Parties or the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers, the Account Parties or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that if such payment is (x) a prepayment
of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements which a Defaulting Lender has funded its participation obligations and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or reimbursement obligations owed to, any Defaulting Lender.
 
           
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
  For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees that ceased to accrue pursuant to clause (a) above while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender or payments that were allocated pursuant to clause (e) above while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender.

of the priority of the Security Interest of the Administrative Agent, other than Permitted Encumbrances that have priority as a matter of law and those Liens expressly permitted pursuant to clauses (c) and (h) of Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement).
 
(c)
 
Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any financing statements or other documents in connection herewith or therewith.

(e)
 
At its option, the Administrative Agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not permitted pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and may pay for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral to the extent any Grantor fails to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent will give notice to the Parent Borrower of any exercise of the Administrative Agents rights or powers pursuant to this paragraph (e); that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not operate as a waiver of, or preclude any other or further exercise of, such rights or powers or the exercise of any other right or power pursuant to this Agreement.

(f)
 
Each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, to the same extent as if the Security Interest had not been granted to the Administrative Agent in the Collateral, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance.
 
(g)
 
None of the Grantors shall (i) make or permit to be made a pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral or (ii) grant any other Lien in respect of the Collateral, except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement.  None of the Grantors shall make or permit to be made any transfer of the Collateral, except that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Grantors that an Event of Default shall have

occurred and be continuing and that during the continuance thereof the Grantors shall not sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Collateral (which notice may be given by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing), the Grantors may use and dispose of the Collateral in any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document;  that, on or prior to the date of any transfer or any other disposition of Inventory permitted by the Credit Agreement by any Grantor to any Subsidiary that is not a Grantor, the Parent Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Asset Coverage Certificate.

(h)
 
The Grantors, at their own expense, shall maintain or cause to be maintained insurance covering physical loss or damage to the Collateral in accordance with the requirements set forth in Schedule III hereto and Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement.  Each Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Administrative Agent) as such Grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, during the continuance of an Event of Default, of (i) making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and (ii) making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto.  In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Administrative Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems advisable.  All sums disbursed by the Administrative Agent in connection with this paragraph, including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, upon demand, by the Grantors to the Administrative Agent and shall be additional Obligations secured hereby.
 
 
 
SECTION 4.01.
 
  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees, upon the demand of the Administrative Agent, to make the Collateral available to the Administrative Agent, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public
Remedies upon Default.

or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.  Upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each such purchaser at any sale of the Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
 
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-612 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.  At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may (with the consent of the Administrative Agent) make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.  For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full, in which case any excess proceeds thereof shall be disposed of as set forth in Section 4.02 hereof.  As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and
10
 
 
 
 
to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
 
SECTION 4.02.
 
  The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds.
 
FIRST, to the payment of all Obligations consisting of costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
 
SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
 
THIRD, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
 
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
 
SECTION 5.01.
 
  In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 5.03), each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement in respect of any Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party, such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of
Indemnity and Subrogation.
11
 
 
 
 
such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Grantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy in whole or in part an Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party, such Borrower or Account Party (as the case may be) shall indemnify such Grantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
 
SECTION 5.02.
 
  Each Guarantor and Grantor (a ) agrees (subject to Section 5.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Obligation or assets of any other Grantor (other than Holdings or the Parent Borrower) shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party  and such other Guarantor or Grantor (the ) shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers or the Account Parties as provided in Section 5.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors and Grantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor or Grantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 6.16 or Section 6.17, respectively, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor or Grantor).  Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall (subject to Section 5.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 5.01 to the extent of such payment.

SECTION 5.03.
 
  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors and Grantors under Sections 5.01 and 5.02 and all other rights of the Guarantors and Grantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations.  No failure on the part of any Borrower, any Account Party or any Guarantor or Grantor to make the payments required by Sections 5.01 and 5.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor or Grantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor and Grantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor or Grantor hereunder.
Subordination.
 
(b)
 
Each of the Guarantors and Grantors hereby agrees that all Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to, or to it by, any other Guarantor, Grantor or any other Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of the Obligations.

SECTION 6.02.
 
  All rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Security Interest and all obligations of each Guarantor and Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document (other than this Agreement), any other agreement with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor or Grantor in respect of the Obligations or this Agreement, other than payment in full of the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).
Rights Absolute.
 
SECTION 6.03.
 
  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect until terminated as provided in Section 6.15(a).
Survival of Agreement.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Administrative Agents name or in the name of such Guarantor or Grantor (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (e) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; and (f) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Administrative Agent to make any commitment or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby, other than to exercise commercially reasonable care in the custody and preservation of

SECTION 6.09.
 
  (a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  No notice or demand on any Party in any case shall entitle any Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment.
 
(b)
 
Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.

(h)
 
The Grantors, at their own expense, shall maintain or cause to be maintained insurance covering physical loss or damage to the Collateral in accordance with the requirements set forth in Schedule III hereto and Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement.  Each Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Administrative Agent) as such Grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, during the continuance of an Event of Default, of (i) making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and (ii) making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto.  In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Administrative Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems advisable.  All sums disbursed by the Administrative Agent in connection with this paragraph, including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, upon demand, by the Grantors to the Administrative Agent and shall be additional Obligations secured hereby.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public
Remedies upon Default.

or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.  Upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each such purchaser at any sale of the Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
 
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-612 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.  At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may (with the consent of the Administrative Agent) make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.  For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full, in which case any excess proceeds thereof shall be disposed of as set forth in Section 4.02 hereof.  As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and
10
 
 
 
 
to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
 
SECTION 4.02.
 
  The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds.
 
FIRST, to the payment of all Obligations consisting of costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
 
SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
 
THIRD, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
 
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
 
SECTION 5.01.
 
  In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 5.03), each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement in respect of any Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party, such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of
Indemnity and Subrogation.
11
 
 
 
 
such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Grantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy in whole or in part an Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party, such Borrower or Account Party (as the case may be) shall indemnify such Grantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
 
SECTION 5.02.
 
  Each Guarantor and Grantor (a ) agrees (subject to Section 5.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Obligation or assets of any other Grantor (other than Holdings or the Parent Borrower) shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any Obligation of a Borrower or an Account Party  and such other Guarantor or Grantor (the ) shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers or the Account Parties as provided in Section 5.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors and Grantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor or Grantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 6.16 or Section 6.17, respectively, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor or Grantor).  Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall (subject to Section 5.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 5.01 to the extent of such payment.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  No notice or demand on any Party in any case shall entitle any Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment.

Exhibit 99.1
-- J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) reported today that its comparable store sales for the four-week period ended April 30, 2011, increased 6.4 percent over last year.  Womens and childrens apparel reported the strongest results in April, followed by mens apparel.  The Companys results were driven by the continued success of its growth initiatives, including Liz Claiborne, Claiborne, and Call it Spring by The ALDO Group, as well as the value offered through jcpenneys power private brands such as Worthington, Arizona and St. Johns Bay.
PLANO, Texas (May 5, 2011)
Geographically, the southeast was the top performing region of the country.  Throughout the month, sales and traffic in several regions were impacted by unseasonable and adverse weather trends.
As anticipated, total company sales were approximately 300 basis points below comparable store sales, and increased 3.4 percent for the month.
First  Quarter Earnings Outlook
 
Due to the Companys overall performance during the quarter, management now expects first quarter earnings to be approximately $0.24 per share, including previously announced non-comparable items.  (This also includes $0.01 per share of restructuring charges related to the
 
 
 
 
 
initial phase of the streamlining of the Companys supply chain operations, offset by a $0.01 per share benefit from the Companys share repurchase program commenced in March 2011.)  The Company had previously expected earnings to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share.
The Company will report its 2011 first quarter results prior to the opening of the market on Monday, May 16, 2011.  Management will host a live conference call and real-time webcast beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET to discuss the Companys results, as well as provide updated expectations for 2011, including guidance for the second quarter.
