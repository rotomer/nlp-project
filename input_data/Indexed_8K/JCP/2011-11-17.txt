           In connection with the elimination of the position of Group Executive Vice President, with responsibility for Information Technology, Corporate Strategy, Digital Ventures, and jcp.com, effective December 1, 2011, Thomas M. Nealon will cease to be an executive officer of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the Company).
(b)
 
           Effective December 5, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company has elected Michael W. Kramer, 47, as the Companys Chief Operating Officer.  Mr. Kramer will be responsible for Finance, Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Information Technology.
(c)
 
Mr. Kramer is joining the Company from Kellwood Company, where he served as President and Chief Executive Officer since 2008.  He previously served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. from 2005 to 2008.  From 2000 to 2005, Mr. Kramer was at Apple, Inc. and worked as the Chief Financial Officer of Apple Retail.  He previously held key financial leadership roles with The Limited, Pizza Hut and Einstein Noah Bagel Corporation.
 
Mr. Kramer and the Company entered into a letter agreement describing certain terms of his employment, including base salary, target incentive award opportunity and a long-term incentive award in the form of restricted stock units, all as further described below.  As an executive officer of the Company, Mr. Kramer will be eligible to enter into the Companys standard form of indemnification agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10(ii)(ab) to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2002, to participate in the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. 2011 Change in Control Plan, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 14, 2011, to enter into an Executive Termination Pay Agreement and to receive the other benefits described in the letter agreement.
 
Mr. Kramer and the Company have not entered into an employment agreement.  There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Kramer and any other person pursuant to which he was elected as an executive officer of the Company.
 
Mr. Kramers base salary and target incentive award opportunity percentage under the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. 2011 Management Incentive Compensation Program are set forth below.  Mr. Kramer will also receive a grant of 750,000 restricted stock units on the date on which his employment with the Company commences, or December 5, 2011 (the Grant Date), which restricted stock units will vest one-third on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date, one-third on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date and one-third on the sixth anniversary of the Grant Date so long as he remains continuously employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date; provided, however, that such restricted stock units will pro rata vest prior to such date if the Company terminates his employment other than for cause; provided, further, that such restricted stock units will fully vest if Mr. Kramers employment terminates in certain cases within two years after a change in control of the Company.  In relinquishment of the value of equity awards granted by his previous employer and as an inducement to join the Company, Mr. Kramer will receive a one-time cash signing bonus of $4,000,000 less applicable taxes within 30 days after the commencement of his employment with the Company and a grant of restricted stock units on the Grant Date, which number will be determined by dividing $4,000,000 by the closing price of the Companys common stock of 50 par value (the Common Stock) on the Grant Date.  Such restricted stock units will vest one-third on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, one-third on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and one-third on the third anniversary of the Grant Date so long as he
 
 
remains continuously employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date; provided, however, that such restricted stock units will fully vest if Mr. Kramers employment with the Company terminates as a result of his death or disability, if the Company terminates his employment other than for cause or if Mr. Kramer terminates his employment with the Company for good reason within two years after a change in control of the Company.
 
 
           On November 17, 2011, the Company and Thomas M. Nealon, Group Executive Vice President of the Company, entered into a Transition Agreement (the Agreement) in connection with the elimination of Mr. Nealons position effective as of December 1, 2011.  Mr. Nealon agrees to be subject to certain restrictive covenants for a 12-month period following the termination of his employment with the Company, including with respect to confidentiality, nonsolicitation of employees, noninterference with business relations and noncompetition.  In exchange for these agreements, Mr. Nealon will receive compensation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  The compensation includes a lump sum cash payment of $1,771,875 and accelerated vesting of his unvested options and restricted stock units that would otherwise be forfeited as of his employment termination date.  Under the Agreement, Mr. Nealon will also continue to receive his current base salary through his employment termination date and will receive a pro-rated portion of his incentive compensation for the 2011 fiscal year, payable at the target amount of $506,250, upon his employment termination date.  Mr. Nealon will continue to be entitled to his accrued benefits under the Companys employee benefit plans and policies in which he participates.
