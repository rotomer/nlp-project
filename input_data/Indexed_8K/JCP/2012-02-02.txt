 On January 27, 2012, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the Company) and its direct wholly-owned subsidiary J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (Corporation) and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation (Purchasing) (Company, Corporation and Purchasing collectively referred to as the Loan Parties) entered into an amendment and restatement of the existing amended and restated Credit Agreement among the Loan Parties, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A., as Administrative Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as LC Agent (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).
 
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement converts the existing facility to an asset-based facility, in which borrowing availability varies according to the Loan Parties levels of inventory and accounts receivable. The maximum availability under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of January 27, 2012 is $1.25 billion, with a $500 million letter of credit sublimit and a $50 million swingline advance sublimit.  At its sole option, the Corporation may, on or prior to February 29, 2012, increase the aggregate size of the facility to $1.5 billion, and may,  at any time prior to the maturity date, request that the aggregate size of the facility be increased by an additional amount not to exceed $250 million.
 
The obligations of the Loan Parties under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company, Corporation, Purchasing and certain of the Companys indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Subject to certain exceptions, the obligations are secured by a lien on the inventory (except for consignment inventory), accounts receivable, and deposit accounts and cash credited thereto, of the Loan Parties and the other subsidiary guarantors pursuant to an amended and restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated as of January 27, 2012 among the Company, Corporation, Purchasing, the subsidiaries of Company identified therein, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A., as Administrative Agent (the Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement).
 
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. There are exceptions to these covenants and some are only applicable when availability falls below certain thresholds. In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a springing fixed charge coverage ratio covenant when availability falls below a specified threshold. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations of the Loan Parties may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.
Certain of the lenders who are parties to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provide commercial banking, investment banking, trustee and custodial services to the Company.
Copies of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.  The foregoing descriptions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement which are incorporated herein by reference.

(b)    (i)  Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to the limitations set forth below in this Section), the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, in its sole discretion (but with absolutely no obligation), and whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, to make Loans to the Borrowers, on behalf of the Lenders, in amounts that exceed Availability, which the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (i) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to or required to be paid by the Loan Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including payments of reimbursable expenses (including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 9.03) and other sums payable under the Loan Documents (any such Loans are herein referred to collectively as ), it being agreed that no Protective Advance shall result in a Default due to the Borrowers failure to comply with Section 2.01 or Section 4.02 for so long as such Protective Advance remains outstanding in accordance with the terms of this Section, but solely with respect to the amount of such Protective Advance.  Protective Advances shall be secured by the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder.  All Protective Advances shall be ABR Borrowings.  The authority of the Administrative Agent to make Protective Advances is limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the total Commitments at any time, and no Protective Advance shall cause any Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed its Commitment, that the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Administrative Agents authorization to make Protective Advances (it being agreed that any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Administrative Agents receipt thereof).  At any time that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, the Administrative Agent may request the Lenders to make a Revolving Loan to repay a Protective Advance.  At any other time the Administrative Agent may require the Lenders to fund their risk participations described in Section 2.04(b)(ii).

Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Protective Advances.

Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly apply the amounts so received by it from the Lenders to its claims against them in respect of such participations in Protective Advances.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Borrower of any participations in any Protective Advances acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Protective Advances shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the applicable Lenders.  Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent from a Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Protective Advance of such Borrower after receipt of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph, as their interests may appear; that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Administrative Agent if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Protective Advance pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) or such other standard of care as shall be separately agreed to in writing by such Issuing Bank and the applicable Account Party,

In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense (other than loss of profit or margin) to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error.

Such successor Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Parent Borrower.  For the avoidance of doubt, any Administrative Agent that is not a U.S. Person shall not be treated as Foreign Lender for purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding three sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation described in this Section 2.16(h) shall not be required if in such successor Administrative Agents judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such successor Administrative Agent to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such successor Administrative Agent.

(a)  Each Borrower and each Account Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due), in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or a Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.  At all times during a Cash Dominion Period, solely for purposes of determining the amount of Loans available for borrowing purposes, checks (in addition to immediately available funds applied pursuant to Section 2.09(f)) from collections of items of payment and proceeds of any
 
 
 
 
 
66
Collateral shall be applied in whole or in part against the Obligations on the Business Day after receipt, subject to actual collection.
 
(b)
 
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c)
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements, Protective Advances or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, Protective Advances and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, Protective Advances and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower or any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by the Administrative Agent in respect of any Protective Advance or by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Holdings or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each of the Borrowers and each of the Account Parties consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) in the amount of such participation.

(d)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower or an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent from such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) has made such
 
 
 
 
 
67
payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)
 
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(iii), 2.04(b)(ii), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
(f)
 
Any proceeds of Collateral or any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement or another Loan Document (i) not constituting either (A) a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrowers), (B) a mandatory prepayment under Section 2.10 (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.10), (C) amounts to be used to cash collateralize LC Exposures, (D) amounts to be applied from the Concentration Account during any Cash Dominion Period (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.09(f)) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, shall be applied ratably to the Obligations as follows:  , to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under any Loan Document (other than in connection with Secured Swap Obligations, Secured Supply Chain Obligations and Secured Treasury Services Obligations), , to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Loan Parties in respect of Loan Document Obligations, , to pay interest due in respect of the Protective Advances, , to pay the principal of the Protective Advances, , to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans (other than the Protective Advances) or unreimbursed LC Disbursements ratably, , to prepay principal on the Loans (other than the Protective Advances), unreimbursed LC Disbursements and (in an amount not to exceed the Designated Secured Obligations Reserve then in effect) the Designated Secured Swap Obligations and the Designated Secured Treasury Services Obligations ratably, , to the payment of any other Loan Document Obligations due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Loan Parties, , to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred three percent (103%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, to the payment of any amounts owing with respect to Secured Swap Obligations and Secured Treasury Services Obligations, and to the payment of any amounts owing with respect to Secured Supply Chain Obligations.

While any Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 2.18.
 
  (a)  If, with respect to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, an event or circumstance occurs that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to exercise any of the rights or benefits afforded by Section 2.14 or 2.16(a), such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall take all steps as may be reasonably available (including designating a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or participating in Letters of Credit or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, or furnishing the proper certificates under any applicable Tax laws, Tax treaties, conventions and governmental regulations to the extent that such certificates are legally available to such Lender or Issuing Bank or to the Administrative Agent) to eliminate or mitigate the effects of any event resulting in the ability of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise rights under any of such Sections; that none of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall be under any obligation to take any step that, in its reasonable judgment, would (i) result in its incurring Additional Costs or Taxes in performing its obligations hereunder unless the Borrowers and the Account Parties have expressly agreed to reimburse it therefor or (ii) be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Bank or to the Administrative Agent.  Within 60 days after the occurrence of any event giving rise to any rights or benefits provided by Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a) in favor of any Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (i) will notify the Parent Borrower of such event or circumstance and (ii) provide the Parent Borrower with a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail (x) the event or circumstance giving rise to any benefit under Sections 2.14 and 2.16(a), (y) the effective date of, and the time period during which, compensation for any Additional Costs or Taxes are being claimed and (z) the determination of amount or amounts claimed thereby and detailed calculations with respect thereto; that, if such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent does not give the Parent Borrower such notice and certificate within the 60-day period set forth in this sentence, the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall be required to indemnify such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent only for such Additional Costs and Taxes as are attributable to the period from and after the first date as of which such notice and certificate have been received by the Parent Borrower.  Such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of any change in circumstances with respect to the event specified in the above-described notice and certificate as promptly as practicable after such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent obtains knowledge thereof.  Such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall deliver the notice and certificate described in this paragraph (a) to the Parent

or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay the amount shown as due on the certificate on the tenth Business Day following receipt thereof and further if the Parent Borrower does provide such required notice, and negotiations are entered into but do not result in agreement by the Parent Borrower and such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent within the 30-Business Day period, then the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall pay the amount shown as due on the certificate on the last day of such period, but in either event not earlier than the date as of which the relevant Additional Costs or Taxes are incurred, (ii) other than with respect to Other Taxes, unless the appropriate notice and certificate are delivered to the Parent Borrower within the 60-day period described in Section 2.18(a), the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the case may be) shall be liable only for Additional Costs, Taxes or amounts required to be paid which are attributable to the period from and after the date such notice and certificate have been received by such Borrower or such Account Party, as applicable, (iii) neither the Borrowers nor the Account Parties shall be liable for any amounts incurred as a result of any change in an Applicable Lending Office of any Issuing Bank or Lender to the extent that such Issuing Bank or Lender shall have had knowledge at the time of such change in Applicable Lending Office that reimbursement or recoupment under Section 2.14 would arise as a result of such change, (iv) each Lender, each Issuing Bank and/or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall in good faith allocate all Additional Costs, Taxes and payments required to be made fairly among all its commitments (whether or not it seeks compensation from all affected Borrowers or Account Parties), (v) none of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to exercise any right or benefit afforded hereby or receive any payment otherwise due under Sections 2.14 and 2.16 (including, without limitation, any repayment by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be) of any refund of Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(g)) which arises from any bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, or the failure of such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to comply with the terms of this Agreement, (vi) if any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall have recouped any amount or received any offsetting Tax benefit (other than a refund of Taxes as described in Section 2.16(g)) or reserve or capital benefits theretofore paid to it by any Borrower or any Account Party (as the case may be), such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Borrower or such Account Party (as the case may be) an amount equal to the amount of the recoupment received by such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent reduced by any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent attributable to such recoupment, as determined in good faith by such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, and (vii) the liability of the Borrowers and the Account Parties to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent with respect to any Indemnified Taxes shall be reduced to the extent that such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent receives an offsetting Tax benefit (or could have received such a benefit by taking reasonable measures to receive it); that there shall not be any reductions pursuant to this clause (vii) with respect to any Tax benefit (x) the existence of which such Lender or Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent is unaware, (y) the claiming of which would result in any cost or Tax to such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (unless the relevant Borrower or the relevant Account Party (as the

fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
 
(b)
 
the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02)
,
provided
that (i) such Defaulting Lenders Commitment may not be increased or extended without its consent and (ii) the principal amount of, or interest or fees payable on, such Defaulting Lenders Loans or participations in LC

Disbursements may not be reduced or excused or the scheduled date of payment may not be postponed as to such Defaulting Lender without such Defaulting Lenders consent;
 
(c)
 
if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists, or any Protective Advance is outstanding, at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)
 
all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure and participations in Protective Advances shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure and participations in Protective Advances does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments (it being understood that in no event shall any non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure exceed such Lenders Commitment as a result of such reallocation) and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)
 
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers or the Account Parties shall within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)
first
, prepay such Swingline Exposure and Protective Advances and (y)
second
, cash collateralize (or, if approved by each applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion, otherwise provide credit support for) such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)
 
if the Borrower
s or the Account Parties cash collateralize, or otherwise provide credit support for, any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized or otherwise has credit support provided therefor;
 
(iv)
 
if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v)
 
if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized, nor otherwise has credit support provided therefor nor is reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized, otherwise has credit support provided therefor and/or is reallocated;
 
(d)
 
so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender
, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be
 
 
 
 
 
73
required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral (or other credit support, if approved by each applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion) will be provided by the Borrowers or the Account Parties in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders
shall not participate therein); and
 
(e)
 
2.17(c),
any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
but excluding Section 2.18(b)) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account (which may be invested as requested by the Parent Borrower, at the Parent Borrowers risk and expense, subject to approval by the Administrative Agent) and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts (other than in respect of Protective Advances) owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder or to the Administrative Agent in respect of Protective Advances, (iii) third, as the Parent Borrower may request (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) to the funding of any Loan or the funding or cash collateralization of any participating interest in any Swingline Loan, Protective Advance or Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement (such amounts to be determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Parent Borrower), (iv) fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers or the Account Parties, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender under this Agreement, (v) fifth, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers, the Account Parties or the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers, the Account Parties or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that if such payment is (x) a prepayment
of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements which a Defaulting Lender has funded its participation obligations and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or reimbursement obligations owed to, any Defaulting Lender.
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers, the Account Parties, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders, and their participations in Protective Advances, shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such
 
 
 
 
 
74
Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans and Protective Advances) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees that ceased to accrue pursuant to clause (a) above while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender or payments that were allocated pursuant to clause (e) above while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender.
 
SECTION 2.22.
 
  (a)  At any time after the Effective Date, the Parent Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request at any time or from time to time that the total Commitments be increased; that (i) the aggregate amount of each such increase pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall not be less than $50,000,000 and the aggregate amount of all such increases pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall not exceed $250,000,000, (ii) each such request of the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to be an offer to each Lender to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of the proposed increased amount and (iii) each Lender, in its sole discretion, may either (A) agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount or (B) decline to increase its Commitment.  Any such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in the total Commitments and the date on which such increase is requested to become effective.  In the event that the Lenders shall have agreed to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the total Commitments requested by the Parent Borrower, the Parent Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any bank or other financial institution increasing its Commitment or providing a new Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22 being called an ), which may include any Lender, to extend Commitments or increase its existing Commitment in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount; that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender (or an Affiliate of a Lender) hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld); that any Commitment extended or increased pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 (or, if less, the balance of the unsubscribed amount of the requested increase in total Commitments).  In addition, the Parent Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), increase the Commitments on a single occasion on or prior to February 29, 2012, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the difference between $1,500,000,000 and the aggregate amount of the Commitments on the Effective Date by obtaining from Lenders (including any Augmenting Lenders) new Commitments or increases of existing Commitments.  Increases of Commitments and new Commitments created pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall become effective upon the execution and delivery by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lenders (including any Augmenting Lenders) agreeing to increase their existing Commitments or extend new Commitments, as the case may be, of an amendment to this Agreement providing for such increased or additional Commitments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the total Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this paragraph (a) unless, on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02(a) and

(b)
 
At the time that any increase in the total Commitments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.22 (a ) becomes effective, if any Revolving Loans are outstanding, the Parent Borrower shall prepay the aggregate principal amount outstanding in respect of such Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10 (the ); that (i) nothing in this Section 2.22 shall prevent the Parent Borrower from funding the prepayment of Initial Loans with concurrent Revolving Loans hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, giving effect to the Commitment Increase, and (ii) no such prepayment shall be required if, after giving effect to the Commitment Increase, each Lender has the same Applicable Percentage as immediately prior to such Commitment Increase.

  b)Except for termination of a Guarantors obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 6.15, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise, other than the defense of payment of such obligations in accordance with the terms thereof.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) the release of any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the Obligations or any of them; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full of all the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made)).  Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such security (in accordance with the Loan Documents) and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, in each case in accordance with the Loan Documents, all without affecting the obligations of any Guarantor (in its capacity as such) hereunder.

No Limitations, Etc
 
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the payment in full of all the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).  The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, and in each case in accordance with the Loan Documents, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept

an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor (in its capacity as such) hereunder except to the extent the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor (in its capacity as such) waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.
 
  Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored to any Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise.
SECTION 2.04.

Reinstatement
 
  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation.  Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against such Loan Party or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article V.
SECTION 2.05.

Agreement To Pay; Subrogation
 
  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Loan Partys financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.

(c)(i) Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the

(e) Each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, to the same extent as if the Security Interest had not been granted to the Administrative Agent in the Collateral, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance.
 
(f) None of the Grantors shall (i) make or permit to be made a pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral or (ii) grant any other Lien in respect of the Collateral, except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement.  None of the Grantors shall make or permit to be made any transfer of the Collateral, except that, unless and until the

(g) The Grantors, at their own expense, shall maintain or cause to be maintained insurance covering physical loss or damage to the Collateral in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement.  Each Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Administrative Agent) as such Grantors true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose, during the continuance of an Event of Default, of (i) making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and (ii) making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto.  In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Administrative Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or any Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems advisable.

(i) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each of the Grantors will collect and enforce, in accordance with past practices and in the ordinary course of business, all amounts due to such Grantor under the Accounts and Payment Intangibles owned by it.  Such Grantor will deliver to the Administrative Agent promptly upon its reasonable request after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default duplicate invoices with respect to each Account and, to the extent applicable, each Payment Intangible owned by it, bearing such
11
 
 
 
 
language of assignment as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify in connection with its exercise of remedies hereunder.
 
  Each Grantor agrees that (a) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the demand of the Administrative Agent, it will make the Collateral available to the Administrative Agent, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law and (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default and at the other times provided for in the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to institute a Cash Dominion Period to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement.

Upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each such purchaser at any sale of the Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
SECTION 4.01.
.
Remedies upon Default
 
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-612 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may,
12
 
 
 
 
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.  At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may (with the consent of the Administrative Agent) make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.  For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full, in which case any excess proceeds thereof shall be disposed of as set forth in Section 4.02 hereof.  As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
 
  The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as specified in Section 2.17(f) of the Credit Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement.  Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.

(c) at its own expense, cause the independent certified public accountants then engaged by each Grantor to prepare and deliver to the Administrative Agent, at any time, and from time to time, promptly upon the Administrative Agents request, the following reports with respect to the Accounts and Payment Intangibles of the applicable Grantor: (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts and Payment Intangibles; (ii) an aging of all Accounts and Payment Intangibles; (iii) trial balances; and (iv) a test verification of such Accounts and Payment Intangibles.
 
  Solely for the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Collateral consisting of Inventory, each Grantor hereby (a) grants to the Administrative Agent a nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantor) to use, license or sublicense during the continuance of an Event of Default any Intellectual Property rights now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, solely for the purposes of preparing for sale and selling (including by affixing Trademarks owned by or licensed to such Grantor to) any of such Grantors Inventory directly to any Person (in the case of Intellectual Property licensed to such Grantor by a third party, to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Intellectual Property), which license shall be irrevocable prior to the Termination Point (as defined below) and (b) agrees that, subject to the foregoing and in connection therewith, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may sell Inventory which bears any Trademark owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Trademark) and any Inventory that is covered by any Copyright owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Copyright), and the Administrative Agent may affix any appropriate Trademark owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property license granting such Grantor rights in such Trademark) and sell such Inventory as provided herein; in each case that (i) such license shall be subject to the rights of any licensee under a license permitted by the last proviso of Section 6.05 of the Credit Agreement or by Section 6.02(b) of the Credit Agreement, in each case granted while no Event of

Such license and rights to use such Intellectual Property of any Grantor shall terminate automatically without notice or other action, when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made) and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement, the LC Exposure has been reduced to zero and no Issuing Bank has any further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement (the ).  The use of such license by the Administrative Agent may only be exercised upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the payment in full of all the Loan Document Obligations (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).  The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, and in each case in accordance with the Loan Documents, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept

an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor (in its capacity as such) hereunder except to the extent the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made).  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor (in its capacity as such) waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.
 
SECTION 2.04.
 
  Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored to any Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise.

SECTION 2.05.
 
  In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation.  Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against such Loan Party or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article V.
Agreement To Pay; Subrogation.
 
SECTION 2.06.
 
  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Loan Partys financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.

Remedies
 
SECTION 4.01.
 
  Each Grantor agrees that (a) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the demand of the Administrative Agent, it will make the Collateral available to the Administrative Agent, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law and (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default and at the other times provided for in the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to institute a Cash Dominion Period to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.  Upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each such purchaser at any sale of the Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
Remedies upon Default.
 
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-612 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may,
12
 
 
 
 
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice.  At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may (with the consent of the Administrative Agent) make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.  For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full, in which case any excess proceeds thereof shall be disposed of as set forth in Section 4.02 hereof.  As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
 
SECTION 4.02.
 
  The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as specified in Section 2.17(f) of the Credit Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement.  Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
Application of Proceeds.
 
SECTION 4.03.
 
  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor will:
Grantors Obligations Upon Default.
13
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent all books and records relating to the Collateral at any place or places reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, whether at a Grantors premises or elsewhere;
 
(b)
 
permit the Administrative Agent, by the Administrative Agents representatives and agents, to enter any premises where all or any part of the Collateral, or the books and records relating thereto, or both, are located, to take possession of and/or remove all or any part of the Collateral or to make copies of the books and records relating thereto, or both, and to conduct sales of the Collateral, in accordance with the terms hereof, any applicable Collateral Access Agreements and applicable law, without any obligation to pay the Grantor for such use and occupancy;
 
(c)
 
at its own expense, cause the independent certified public accountants then engaged by each Grantor to prepare and deliver to the Administrative Agent, at any time, and from time to time, promptly upon the Administrative Agents request, the following reports with respect to the Accounts and Payment Intangibles of the applicable Grantor: (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts and Payment Intangibles; (ii) an aging of all Accounts and Payment Intangibles; (iii) trial balances; and (iv) a test verification of such Accounts and Payment Intangibles.
 
SECTION 4.04.
 
  Solely for the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Collateral consisting of Inventory, each Grantor hereby (a) grants to the Administrative Agent a nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantor) to use, license or sublicense during the continuance of an Event of Default any Intellectual Property rights now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, solely for the purposes of preparing for sale and selling (including by affixing Trademarks owned by or licensed to such Grantor to) any of such Grantors Inventory directly to any Person (in the case of Intellectual Property licensed to such Grantor by a third party, to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Intellectual Property), which license shall be irrevocable prior to the Termination Point (as defined below) and (b) agrees that, subject to the foregoing and in connection therewith, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may sell Inventory which bears any Trademark owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Trademark) and any Inventory that is covered by any Copyright owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property licenses granting such Grantor rights in such Copyright), and the Administrative Agent may affix any appropriate Trademark owned by or licensed to such Grantor (to the extent permitted under the Intellectual Property license granting such Grantor rights in such Trademark) and sell such Inventory as provided herein; in each case that (i) such license shall be subject to the rights of any licensee under a license permitted by the last proviso of Section 6.05 of the Credit Agreement or by Section 6.02(b) of the Credit Agreement, in each case granted while no Event of
Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property.
provided
14
 
 
 
 
Default was continuing, or under any licenses existing as of the date hereof, (ii) in connection with any such sale of Inventory or otherwise, such licensed or sublicensed Trademarks shall only be used in association with goods or services of a quality and nature consistent with the quality and reputation with which such Trademarks were associated when used by such Grantor prior to the exercise of the license rights set forth herein, and (iii) no license shall be granted under this Section 4.04 to the extent that such grant would violate or constitute a default under any agreement to which any Grantor is a party.  Such license and rights to use such Intellectual Property of any Grantor shall terminate automatically without notice or other action, when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full (other than unasserted indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case for which no claim has been made) and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement, the LC Exposure has been reduced to zero and no Issuing Bank has any further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement (the ).  The use of such license by the Administrative Agent may only be exercised upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
