On July 20, 2012, Simon Property Group, L.P. (SPG) redeemed 2,000,000 limited partnership units held by JCP Realty, Inc. (JCP Realty), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (the Company), for cash at a price of $124.00 per unit.  Following the transaction, JCP Realty continues to hold approximately 205,000 limited partnership units in SPG.
 
In connection with the redemption, JCP Realty agreed to make future capital contributions to SPG under certain circumstances.  Capital contributions would be required only if (i) one or more unsecured senior notes or term loans of SPG are in default and (ii) the aggregate amount received and/or realized by the lenders with respect to such notes or loans upon the exhaustion of all other remedies available to them is less than the maximum amount of all capital contribution commitments of JCP Realty and other parties with similar commitments.  JCP Realtys contribution obligation is subject to a maximum aggregate amount of $360 million, and is proportionate to its share of all similar commitments provided by JCP Realty and other parties.
 
Also, on July 20, 2012, the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (the Corporation), and the Corporations wholly-owned subsidiary J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation (Purchasing) (Company, Corporation and Purchasing collectively referred to as the Loan Parties), entered into a Second Amendment (the Second Amendment) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2012 (as amended through the date of the Second Amendment, the Credit Agreement), among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions named therein as lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as LC Agent.  The Second Amendment amends the definition of Material Subsidiary to clarify that JCP Realty shall not be considered a Material Subsidiary so long as its Net Tangible Assets represent less than 5% of the total Net Tangible Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement.
