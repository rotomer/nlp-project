News Release
- JDS Uniphase Corporation (NASDAQ: JDSU and TSX: JDU) today reported results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2003. Net sales for the quarter were $166 million, as compared to $157 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, and $262 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.
Ottawa, Ontario, and San Jose, California, April 29, 2003
"Although the environment remains extremely challenging, we are pleased to see signs of stability in our revenue with a 6% sequential growth over the last quarter," said Jozef Straus, Co-Chairman and CEO. "These results, combined with our continuing cost reductions under the Global Realignment Program, have enabled us to significantly improve our gross margin and reduce overhead expenses leading to improved financial performance."
The Company reported a net loss of $137 million, or $0.10 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $215 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, and a net loss of $4.3 billion, or $3.19 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.
On a non-GAAP (formerly referred to as "pro forma") basis, which excludes restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation charges, gains and losses on investments, and an adjustment to a prior-period tax provision that was recorded in the third quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $45 million, or $0.03 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $93 million, or $0.07 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, and a net loss of $44 million, or $0.03 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.
For the first time in the third quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company excluded restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program from its non-GAAP results. All prior-period non-GAAP results have been restated for comparative presentation. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to complement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by identifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the GAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company's core operating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company's GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" schedules below.
Financial Overview - Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2003
Communications Products Group represented $74 million in sales, or 44% of total sales. Thin Film Products Group represented $92 million in sales, or 56% of total sales.
Texas Instruments and SICPA, both customers of the Company's Thin Film Products Group, represented 13% and 11% of total sales, respectively.
On a geographic basis, sales to North American customers represented 70% of total sales. European and Asian customers represented 16% and 14% of total sales, respectively.
GAAP operating expenses were $138 million, or 83% of total sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $83 million, or 50% of total sales.
The Company recorded $11 million of reductions in certain long-lived assets classified as held for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
The Company recorded an income tax provision of $19 million. Of this amount, $18 million was due to a review of pending tax refund claims by Canadian tax authorities which caused the Company to conclude that it had recorded net deferred tax assets in excess of tax refunds recoverable from prior years.
The Company held $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, of which over $1.2 billion was cash, money market and other highly liquid fixed income securities. The Company used $51 million in cash from operations, including $31 million used for the Global Realignment Program. It also included the benefit of $62 million in tax refunds received during the quarter.
Global Realignment Program
The Company is continuing its restructuring activities under the Global Realignment Program in response to the business downturn. The Company reported the following progress and expectations in connection with the Global Realignment Program:
To date, the Global Realignment Program has reduced the Company's annual costs by approximately $1.1 billion. Because of the challenging environment in communications markets, the Company is continuing to undertake expense reductions that, when completed, are currently anticipated to generate total annual cost reductions of approximately $1.3 billion, as compared to cost levels at the commencement of the Global Realignment Program.
The Company is undertaking further reductions of employment and additional site closures. The Company's global employment was approximately 6,400 at the end of the third quarter.
The Company still estimates that the total cost of the Global Realignment Program will be approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion was recorded through March 31, 2003.
The Global Realignment Program used $31 million in cash during the third quarter. To date, the Global Realignment Program has used approximately $250 million in cash, and additional cash outlays of approximately $200 million over future periods are expected.
Business Outlook
The Company anticipates net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 will be in the range of $155 to $165 million. The Company expects revenue from the Communications Products Group will remain stable, while revenue from the Thin Film Products Group will remain flat or decline slightly. The Company expects non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 17% to 19% of total net sales, with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.02 to $0.04 per share. The Company expects to achieve non-GAAP EBITDA (non-GAAP earnings before interest income and expense, provision for income tax, depreciation and amortization) breakeven at a revenue level of $200 million by the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Please note that our outlook excludes potential GAAP-required items, such as restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of goodwill and other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on investments, the likelihood and amount of which are uncertain at this time.

____________________
(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2003, the Company recorded an $18.6 million provision for income taxes. Of this amount, approximately $18.0 million was related to the prior financial reporting period ended June 30, 2002, and resulted from an increase in the Company's valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, Canadian tax authorities completed a review of the Company's pending claims for refunds of prior year income taxes. As a result of this review, certain matters related to carryback periods and minimum taxes were identified that caused the Company to conclude that it had recorded $18.0 million of net deferred tax assets in excess of income taxes actually recoverable from prior years and therefore necessitated the recording of an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
(2) During the three months ended March 31, 2003, the Company finalized a royalty-bearing patent license and recorded $8.7 million of royalty expense under "Cost of sales." During the three months ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded $8.3 million of "Selling, general and administrative" expense in connection with this pending patent license. The Company has subsequently reclassified this $8.3 million from "Selling, general and administrative" expense to "Cost of sales" for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and for the nine months ended March 31, 2003.
