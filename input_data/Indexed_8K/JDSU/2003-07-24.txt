Exhibit 99.1
News Release
- JDS Uniphase Corporation (NASDAQ: JDSU and TSX: JDU) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.
Ottawa, Ontario, and San Jose, California, July 24, 2003
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $161 million, compared to net sales of $166 million for the third quarter ended March 31, 2003 and net sales of $222 million for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2002. Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 were $676 million, compared to net sales of $1.1 billion reported for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002.
The Company reported a net loss of $61.6 million, or $0.04 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $137 million, or $0.10 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, and a net loss of $1,043 million, or $0.76 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2002. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, the company reported a net loss of $934 million or $0.66 per share compared to a net loss of $8.7 billion or $6.50 per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation charges, gains and losses on sale of subsidiaries' assets, and gains and losses on investments, the Company reported a net loss of $29 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $45 million, or $0.03 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, and a net loss of $79 million, or $0.06 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2002.
"The Company has made great progress during Fiscal 2003 in reducing its cost structure; and we continue with much resolve towards achieving profitability at existing and anticipated revenue levels," said Jozef Straus, Co-Chairman and CEO. "Notwithstanding ongoing market challenges across our business segments, we believe we are positioning our company through strategic, operational, market, and product development activities to take full advantage of the opportunities we see on the horizon for Fiscal 2004 and beyond."
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to complement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by identifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the GAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company's core operating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company's GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" schedules below.
Financial Overview - Fourth Quarter Ended June 30, 2003
On a geographic basis, sales to North American customers represented 70% of total sales. European and Asian customers represented 17% and 13% of total sales, respectively.
SICPA, a customer of the Company's Thin Film Products Group, represented 11% of total sales.
The Communications Products Group represented $76 million in sales, or 47% of total sales. The Thin Film Products Group represented $85 million in sales, or 53% of total sales.
GAAP gross margin was 24% of total sales, and non-GAAP gross margin was 25% of total sales.
GAAP operating expenses were $103 million, or 64% of total sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $75 million, or 47% of total sales.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.0 million. The benefit resulted from a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to the unrealized gain on our investment in public equities. Fluctuations in the market value of our equity investment may create volatility in our income tax provision / (benefit) in future quarters.
The Company held $1,234 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter, of which approximately $1,160 million was cash, money market and other highly liquid fixed income securities. The Company used $52.5 million in cash from operations, including $27 million used for the Global Realignment Program. The cash used was net of $4.0 million in net tax refunds received during the fourth quarter.
Global Realignment Program
The Company is continuing its restructuring activities under the Global Realignment Program in response to the business downturn. The Company reported the following progress and expectations in connection with the Global Realignment Program:
To date, the Global Realignment Program has reduced the Company's annual costs by approximately $1.2 billion. Most of the actions under the Global Realignment Program are expected to be completed by the end of December of 2003 and should generate total annual cost reductions of approximately $1.3 billion, as compared to cost levels at the commencement of the Global Realignment Program.
The Company has undertaken further reductions of employment and additional site closures. The Company's global employment was approximately 5,500 employees at the end of the fourth quarter.
The Company still estimates that the total cost of the Global Realignment Program will be approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion was recorded through June 30, 2003.
The Global Realignment Program used $27 million in cash during the fourth quarter. To date, the Global Realignment Program has used approximately $280 million in cash, and additional cash outlays of approximately $170 million over future periods are expected.
Business Outlook
The Company anticipates net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 will be in the range of $145 to $155 million. The Company expects non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 19% to 21% of total net sales, with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.02 to $0.03 per share. The Company expects to breakeven on a non-GAAP EBITDA (non-GAAP earnings before interest income and expense, provision for income tax, depreciation and amortization) basis assuming a quarterly revenue level of $200 million by the second quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition, the Company expects to breakeven on a non-GAAP EBITDA basis assuming $170 million in quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Please note that these breakeven levels are indicative of expected improvements to the cost structure and are not intended as projections. The Company is expressly not providing revenue guidance beyond the current quarter. Please further note that the outlook excludes items which depending upon actual results may be required by GAAP, such as restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of goodwill and other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on investments, the likelihood and amount of which are uncertain at this time.
