Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
In the last week there have been several articles in the national press discussing the Company's proposed 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. For clarity, at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders to be held on November 6, 2003, stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the Company's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Company designed the Plan with the intention of better aligning employee equity incentive awards, including option grants, to the long-term interests of our stockholders, and particularly with respect to senior management, to allow the Company to more closely tie vesting to performance. To ensure that the Company's compensation strategy was reflective of the interests of the Company's long-term shareholders, the Plan was designed with input from one of the Company's significant shareholders, CalPERS.
Among its other provisions, the Plan would limit the maximum number of shares available for equity incentive awards that could be awarded to employees, including management, before obtaining further stockholder approval by eliminating the so-called "evergreen" provision which automatically annually increased the number of shares that were available for award under our current plan. Additionally, the Plan would limit the total number of equity incentive awards that could be made to the Company's five most highly compensated executive officers to a maximum of 5% of the total number of shares awarded in each fiscal year, though awards issued in connection with the initial hiring or promotion of such individuals is excluded from this limit. This limit would better insure that our equity incentive programs are truly broad based. A detailed description of the Plan and other items being voted on by shareholders is contained in the Company's annual meeting proxy statement, which is available on the SEC's and the Company's websites.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
- JDS Uniphase Corporation (NASDAQ: JDSU and TSX: JDU) today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2004 ended September 30, 2003.
San Jose, California, October 23, 2003
Net revenue for the first quarter was $147.4 million, compared to net revenue of $160.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and net revenue of $193 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2002.
The Company reported a reduced net loss of $28.1 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $61.6 million, or $0.04 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and a net loss of $520.5 million, or $0.37 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2002.
On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported a reduced net loss of $13.5 million, or $0.01 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $22.3 million, or $0.02 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and a net loss of $62.4 million, or $0.04 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Non-GAAP results exclude the following: restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program; the cumulative effect of an accounting change; amortization of purchased intangibles; reductions of long-lived assets; stock-based compensation charges; gains and losses on sale of subsidiaries' assets; and gains and losses on investments.
On a non-GAAP EBITDA basis (non-GAAP loss from operations excluding depreciation), the Company's net loss was $18.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, down from $24.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and $55.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2002.
"The leadership transition has progressed smoothly, and progress on reducing losses has been steady, driven by our imperative to be well poised for a stabilizing market," said Kevin Kennedy, CEO. "Throughout this transition and beyond we are making deliberate choices intended to ensure the success of JDS Uniphase as a leader in the industry with a customer-driven focus on operational excellence and profitability."
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by identifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the GAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company's core operating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company's GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" and "Additional Non-GAAP Selected Financial Information" schedules below.
Financial Overview - First Quarter Ended September 30, 2003
On a geographic basis, revenue to North American customers represented 66% of total revenue. European and Asian customers represented 18% and 16% of total revenue, respectively.
The Communications Products Group represented $74 million in revenue, or 50% of total revenue. The Thin Film Products Group represented $73 million in revenue, or 50% of total revenue.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 22% of total revenue.
GAAP operating expenses were $71 million, or 48% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $62 million, or 42% of total revenue.
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $13 million. The income tax benefit resulted from an unrealized gain on our investment in public equities. Further fluctuations in the market value or revenue from these public equities may create volatility in our income tax provision/ (benefit) in future quarters.
The Company held $1,160 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter, of which approximately $1,052 million was cash, money market and other highly liquid fixed income securities. The Company used $77 million in cash from operations, including $19 million used for the Global Realignment Program. Additionally, the Company used $45 million to acquire the assets under a synthetic lease agreement, which terminated during the first quarter, and received $18 million from the sale of a facility.
Global Realignment Program
The Company is continuing its restructuring activities under the Global Realignment Program in response to business conditions. The Company reported the following progress and expectations in connection with the Global Realignment Program:
To date, the Global Realignment Program has reduced the Company's annual costs by approximately $1.3 billion. Most of the actions under the previously defined Global Realignment Program are expected to be completed by the end of December 2003.
The Company has undertaken further reductions of employment and additional site closures. The Company had approximately 5,200 employees worldwide at the end of the first quarter.
The Company estimates that the total cost of the Global Realignment Program will be approximately $ 1.2 billion, virtually all of which was recorded through September 30, 2003.
The Global Realignment Program used $19 million in cash during the first quarter. To date, the Global Realignment Program has used approximately $300 million in cash, and additional cash outlays of approximately $120 million over future periods are expected (primarily for leased premises).
Business Outlook
The Company expects to complete cost reductions under which the Company would breakeven, on a non-GAAP EBITDA basis, at a revenue threshold of $200 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, and at a revenue threshold of $170 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
The Company anticipates revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 will be in the range of $140 to $150 million. The Company expects non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 19% to 21% of total revenue, with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.02 to $0.03 per share.
Please note that these breakeven levels are indicative of expected improvements to the cost structure and are not intended as revenue projections. The Company is expressly not providing revenue guidance beyond the current quarter. Please further note that the outlook excludes items which will be required by GAAP, such as restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of goodwill and other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on investments. We are unable to provide comparable guidance prepared in accordance with GAAP because the likelihood and amount of these items are uncertain at this time.
Conference Call
The Company will discuss these results and other related matters at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on October 23, 2003 in a live webcast, which will also be archived for replay on the Company's website at www.jdsu.com under Investor Relations / Investor Presentations and on the Investor Relations Welcome Page. This press release is being filed as a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and will be available at www.sec.gov shortly after it becomes public.
