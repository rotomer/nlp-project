News Release
San Jose, California, January 28, 2004
- JDS Uniphase Corporation (NASDAQ: JDSU and TSX: JDU) today reported results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2004 ended December 31, 2003. For the quarter, net revenue increased approximately 4% and exceeded guidance.
Net revenues for the second quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $153 million, compared to net revenues of $147 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and net revenues of $157 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2002.
The Company reported a net loss of $59 million, or $0.04 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $28 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and a net loss of $215 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring and other charges associated with the Global Realignment Program, the cumulative effect of an accounting change, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of long- lived assets, stock-based compensation charges, gains and losses on sale of subsidiaries, and gains and losses on investments, the Company reported a net loss of $19 million, or $0.01 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, as compared to a net loss of $14 million, or $0.01 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and a net loss of $93 million, or $0.07 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2002.
On a non-GAAP EBITDA basis (non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), the Company lost $15 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, $19 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and $82 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2002.
"Overall, we accomplished our financial and operational objectives for the quarter," said Kevin Kennedy, CEO. "As our markets stabilize and begin to show signs of growth, we approached this quarter with an intense focus on customer-driven execution improvements and a continuing drive towards profitability."
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by identifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the GAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company's core operating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company's GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" schedules below.
Financial Overview - Second Quarter Ended December 31, 2003
On a geographic basis, net revenue from North American customers represented 68% of net revenue. European and Asian customers represented 17% and 15% of net revenue, respectively.
The Communications Products Group represented $78 million in net revenue, or 51% of net revenue. The Thin Film Products Group represented $75 million in net revenue, or 49% of net revenue.
GAAP gross margin was 22% of net revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin was 23% of net revenue.
GAAP operating expenses were $113 million, or 74% of total net revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $61 million, or 40% of net revenue. Included in GAAP operating expenses were reductions in the value of assets held for sale of approximately $38 million.
The Company recorded tax expense of $3 million. Income tax expense primarily resulted from the realized gain on the sale of public equities. Further fluctuations in the market value or sales of these public equities may create volatility in our income tax expense/(benefit) in future quarters.
The Company held $1,648 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter, of which approximately $1,557 million was cash, money market and other highly liquid fixed income securities. The Company received approximately $463 million in net proceeds from the October 2003 convertible debt offering and generated $7 million in cash from operations, after deducting $14 million used for the Global Realignment Program and including $14 million received in tax refunds.
Global Realignment Program
The Company has essentially completed those restructuring activities previously outlined under the Global Realignment Program. The Company reported the following progress:
Under the Global Realignment Program, the Company has spent or accrued approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the program and reduced its annual expected costs by approximately $1.3 billion.
The Global Realignment Program used $14 million in cash during the second quarter. Expense for the quarter was $10 million. To date, the Global Realignment Program has used approximately $300 million in cash, and additional cash outlays of approximately $100 million over future periods are expected (primarily for leased premises).
The Company expects to continue to incur expenses in the future related to actions already taken or announced under the Global Realignment Program, and for future alignment or operational improvement actions.
Business Outlook
The Company anticipates net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 will increase in the range of 1% to 6% over net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company expects non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 23% to 25% of net revenue, with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.01 per share. The Company expects to achieve breakeven on a non-GAAP EBITDA basis assuming $170 million in quarterly net revenue by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Please note that this breakeven level is indicative of expected improvements to the cost structure and is not intended as a revenue projection. The Company is expressly not providing revenue guidance beyond the current quarter. Please further note that the outlook excludes items which depending upon actual results may be required by GAAP, such as restructuring, amortization of purchased intangibles, reductions of goodwill and other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on investments, the likelihood and amount of which are uncertain at this time.
