A copy of the press release, dated as of April 20, 2005, is furnished as to this Current Report and the fifth paragraph of the press release is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On April 14, 2005, the Company took steps to commit itself to the consolidation of its manufacturing operations and the transfer of such operations to other Company facilities and to the facilities of its contract manufacturing partners, including Fabrinet. In addition, the Company intends to reduce its manufacturing operations in Santa Rosa, California by phasing out certain products. The Company expects that by the end of the calendar year these actions will reduce the Company's worldwide manufacturing employee headcount by a minimum of 700 people plus 150 people in support positions. Further information on a number of these actions is set forth in the first four paragraphs of the April 20, 2005 press release, which portions are incorporated in this Item 2.05 by reference. This consolidation and transfer of the Company's manufacturing operations is part of the Company's business strategy to achieve profitability and increase corporate agility by reducing cost structure and eliminating non-core products.
The facility transfers to Fabrinet are expected to be completed by the end of the current quarter, ending June 30, 2005, while the actions involving the transfer of manufacturing operations and product line discontinuances are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, ending December 31, 2005.
The Company has determined that at the time of this filing, it is unable in good faith to make a determination of the estimates required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of Item 2.05 of the Form 8-K General Instructions. The Company will file an amended report on Form 8-K within four business days of making a determination of the required estimates.
