Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 22, 2005, JDS Uniphase Corporation (the "Company") approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and "out-of-the-money" stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $2.50 per share previously awarded to its employees, including its executive officers, but excluding its non-employee directors, under the Company's equity compensation plans. The acceleration of vesting will be effective for stock options outstanding as of June 22, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 33.85 million shares of common stock or 21.7% of the Company's outstanding unvested options (of which options to purchase approximately 4.6 million shares or 2.9% of the Company's outstanding unvested options are held by the Company's executive officers) are subject to the acceleration. The weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration is $4.69.
 
The purpose of the acceleration is to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in its consolidated statements of operations, upon adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R (Share-Based Payment) in July 2005. The pre-tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately $80 million which would have been recognized over the expected life of the unvested options subject to acceleration. The options subject to acceleration on average vest 1.55 years from the effective date of the acceleration.
