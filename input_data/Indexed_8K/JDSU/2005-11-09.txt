 JDSU today reported fiscal 2006 first quarter results, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
San Jose, California, November 9, 2005
 
On a GAAP basis, net revenue for the first quarter was $258.3 million, and GAAP net loss was $67.0 million, or $0.04 per share. This compares to net revenue of $170.9 million and a GAAP net loss of $145.7 million, or $0.10 per share, reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and to net revenue of $194.5 million and a GAAP net loss of $36.0 million, or $0.02 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for the first quarter was $16.2 million, or $0.01 per share, as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $21.8 million, or $0.02 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and to a non-GAAP net loss of $14.1 million, or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
On a non-GAAP EBITDA basis (non-GAAP operating income/(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), the Company lost $5.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, as compared to a loss of $19.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and a loss of $5.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
"Reflecting JDSU's more diversified business model, we achieved significant gross margin improvement driven by the strong performance of our recently acquired Communications Test and Measurement business," said Kevin Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer of JDSU. "Non-GAAP gross margin of nearly 32% represented our strongest result in more than three years, and we remain on track to achieve $88 million of previously announced annualized cost savings by the end of fiscal 2006."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA financial measures as supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. The Company evaluates Company-wide segment performance using, among other things, the measures disclosed in this release for the purposes of evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as its performance relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses these items to further its own understanding of the Company's core operating performance. The Company believes its "core
JDSU News Release
 
operating performance" represents the Company's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" those items, such as those relating to restructuring, investing and non-cash activities, that management does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities.
 
The Company believes that providing this information to its investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows investors to see Company results "through the eyes" of management. The Company further believes that providing this information allows Company investors to both better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
 
The non-GAAP adjustments described in this release have historically been excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below:
 
Restructuring Activities
 
Cost of goods sold, costs of research and development and costs of selling, general and administrative related to restructuring events: The Company has incurred periodic expenses, included in its GAAP presentation of gross margin and operating expenses primarily due to the write-down of certain property and equipment that has been identified for disposal but remained in use until the date of disposal, workforce related charges such as retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to a formal restructuring plan, building costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain facilities and equipment from buildings which the Company has disposed of or plans to dispose. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not reflect expected future gross profits or operating expenses nor does the Company believe that they provide a meaningful evaluation of current versus past core operational performance.
 
Restructuring expense primarily due to severance and lease costs: The Company has incurred restructuring expenses, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, primarily due to workforce related charges such as payments for severance and benefits and estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments related to a formal restructuring plan. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not reflect expected future operating expenses nor does the Company believe that they provide a meaningful evaluation of current versus past core operational performance.
 
Investment Activities
 
Gain or loss on sale of available for-sale investments and reduction in the fair value of investments: The Company has sold investments or adjusted the value of investments from time to time based on market conditions. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business is not
JDSU News Release
 
making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets. Moreover, the amount and timing of gains and losses and adjustments to the value of investments are unpredictable. Consequently, the Company believes that gains or losses on these sales and adjustments to the value of investments are not related to the ongoing core business and operating performance of the Company. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of the Company's core operating performance.
 
Gain or loss on equity method investments: The Company records gains or losses on its equity investments based on our pro-rata share of gains or the net losses of the investment. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business is not making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of gains or losses are unpredictable, as they are inherently based on the performance of the third party subject of a particular investment. Gains and losses in equity investments are unpredictable, and are primarily dependent on the financial performance of the company in which we have our investment. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
 
Non-Cash Activities
 
Stock based compensation related to the implementation of FAS 123R. The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. Management excludes these items, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operations expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. We believe the non-GAAP adjustment will assist investors to compare current versus past performance. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is indicative of the Company's core operational cash flow.
 
Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions: The Company incurs amortization of intangibles, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, related to the various acquisitions it has made. Management excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that eliminating this expense from operating income is useful to investors because it believes the GAAP measure, alone, is not indicative of its core operating expenses and performance.
 
Acquired In-Process Research and Development: The Company recorded charges for acquired in-process research and development, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, in connection with its acquisitions. These amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses. There can be no assurance that acquisition of businesses, products or technologies in the future will not result in substantial charges for acquired IPR&D. Accordingly, acquired IPR&D are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this expense, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, is useful to investors.
JDSU News Release
 
Deferred revenue: The Company adjusts deferred revenue acquired in an acquisition to the estimated fair market value. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP net loss per share excludes this adjustment. Management believes excluding this adjustment provides value to management and investors by showing the Company's core operating performance.
 
Inventory write-up: As required under GAAP the company writes-up acquired inventory values to estimated fair market value. The inventory write-up is charged to cost of sales as the inventory is sold. Management believes these expenses are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this expense, for purposes of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share is useful to investors and provides a useful indicator of the Company's core operating performance.
 
Reduction of goodwill and other long-lived assets: The Company incurs costs, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, related to the reduction of the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets primarily related to SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 adjustments, respectively. SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 adjustments typically occur when the financial performance of the business utilizing the affected assets falls below certain thresholds or certain assets are designated as held for sale. Accordingly, SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 related asset value reductions are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this item, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, is useful to investors. We believe this non-GAAP adjustment will assist investors to compare current versus past performance. The Company's historical adjustments to the carrying value of certain of its assets under SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, as well as the methodology used by the Company in assessing the same, are more particularly described in its quarterly reports on form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.
 
Loss on sale of subsidiaries' assets: The Company recognized loss, included in its GAAP presentation of net loss, related to the sale of its subsidiaries' assets. The Company's core business is not in divestiture of its subsidiaries. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of gains and losses are unpredictable. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that the GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
 
Interest, taxes, and depreciation expense: The Company incurs depreciation expense in its operating results. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP EBITDA excludes items as a result of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is indicative of the Company's core operational cash flow.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating expense is operating expense. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP
JDSU News Release
 
net loss is net loss. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net loss per share is net loss per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP EBITDA is loss from operations. The Company believes that these GAAP measures alone are not indicative of its core operating expenses and performance. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information is set forth below.
 
The following table reconciles non-GAAP gross profit, operating expense, net loss, net loss per share, and EBITDA financial measures to GAAP (in millions, except per share amounts):
