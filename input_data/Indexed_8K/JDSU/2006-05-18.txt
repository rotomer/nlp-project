Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 17, 2006, JDS Uniphase Corporation (the Company) completed an offering of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 (the Notes) to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). An additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of notes may be issued, at the option of the initial purchasers, within 30 days of the initial issuance of the Notes.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of May 17, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Indenture). The Indenture and form of Notes are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the descriptions of the terms of the Indenture and Notes in this Item 1.01 are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibits.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2006. The Notes mature on May 15, 2026. The Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations, will rank equal in right of payment with our other senior unsecured debt and senior to all our future subordinated debt.
 
Holders may convert the Notes into cash and shares of the Companys common stock, if any, based on a conversion rate of 264.0264 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment, prior to stated maturity under the following circumstances:
(1) if the closing price of the common stock reaches, or the
 
trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds; (2) if the Notes have been called for redemption;
 
(3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions; or (4) during
 
the ten trading days prior to, but not on, the maturity date.
 
Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the Notes on each of May 15, 2013, May 15, 2016 and May 15, 2021 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. In addition, upon certain fundamental changes, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date.
The Company may not redeem the notes before May 20, 2013. On or after that date, the Company may redeem all or part of the notes for cash at 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
 
The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, may be declared immediately due and payable. These amounts automatically become due and payable if an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs.
 
Holders of the Notes are entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 17, 2006, among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as initial purchasers (the Registration Rights Agreement). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering resales of the Notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.

Form Of Documents Delivered To Trustee
. In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
 
Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

Section 6.01
) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
(b)
  
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee reasonably deems sufficient.
 
(c)
  
The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 10.08) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Securities
), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 17, 2006 (herein called the 
Indenture
), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (herein called the 
Trustee
), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities.
 
The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and ranks equally with the Companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
 
Interest
. The Company, promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 1.00% per annum. The Company will pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year commencing on November 15, 2006.
Interest will be paid to the person in whose name a Security is registered at the close of business on May 1 and November 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
The Holder of this Security after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Regular Record Date shall be entitled to receive interest (including any Additional Interest Amount), on this Security on the corresponding interest payment date. The Holder of this Security after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest (including any Additional Interest Amount) payable on the corresponding interest payment date notwithstanding the conversion of this Security at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. If this Security is surrendered for conversion during the period after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Regular Record Date to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the corresponding interest payment date, it must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest (including any Additional Interest Amount) that the Holder is to receive on the Securities.

Except where this Security is surrendered for conversion and must be accompanied by payment as described above, no interest or Additional Interest Amount thereon will be payable by the Company on any interest payment date subsequent to the date of conversion, and delivery of the cash and shares of Common Stock, if applicable, pursuant to Article XII of the Indenture, together with any cash payment for any fractional share, upon conversion will be deemed to satisfy the Companys obligation to pay the principal amount of the Securities and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest Amount, if any, to, but not including, the related Conversion Date.
Method of Payment
. By no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date on which any principal of or interest (including any Additional Interest Amount), on any Security is due and payable, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay such amount.

Payments in respect of Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal and interest (including any Additional Interest Amount)) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company.

Redemption Price

If cash sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Redemption Date, then on such Redemption Date, interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 of Principal Amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 of Principal Amount.
 
Purchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder on a Repurchase Date
. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase, at the option of the Holder, all or any portion of the Securities held by such Holder on May 15, 2013, May 15, 2016 and May 15, 2021 (each, a 
Repurchase Date

Repurchase Price
). To exercise such right, a Holder shall deliver to the Paying Agent a Repurchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date that is 20 Business Days immediately preceding such Repurchase Date until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Repurchase Date, and shall deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture.

Purchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder upon a Fundamental Change
. At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the Securities, in cash, if a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to May 15, 2026 at a price equal to the Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date (the 
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price
).
 
Holders have the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
 
If cash sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased on a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Business Day following the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, upon surrender of such Security).
 
Conversion
. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including without limitation the conditions of conversion of this Security set forth in
Section 14.01
thereof), the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, to convert the Principal Amount hereof or any portion of such principal which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into, subject to
Section 14.02
of the Indenture, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, at the Conversion Rate. The initial Conversion Rate is 264.0264 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities (equivalent to a conversion price of $3.79 (the 
Conversion Price
)), subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, based on a Daily Conversion Value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the Observation Period, as set forth in the Indenture. No fractional shares will be issued upon any conversion, but an adjustment and payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Securities for conversion. Securities in respect of which a Holder is exercising its right to require repurchase on a Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date may be converted only if such Holder withdraws its election to exercise such right in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
 
Upon conversion, the Company shall deliver, for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities being converted, cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 or (ii) the Conversion Value. To the extent the Conversion Value exceeds $1,000, the Company may choose to deliver cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of Outstanding Securities a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of said principal hereof on or after the respective due dates expressed herein or for the enforcement of any conversion right.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the Principal Amount, Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of, and interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, on, this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin, currency or shares, herein prescribed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company may, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the Securities, amend the obligation of the Company to repurchase Securities upon a Fundamental Change.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate Principal Amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Securities are issuable only in registered form in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 above that amount, as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth.

(a)
  
If an Event of Default (other than those specified in
Section 5.01(g)
and
Section 5.01(h)
with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, on all the Outstanding Securities to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, shall become immediately due and payable.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default specified in
Section 5.01(g)

Section 5.01(h)
with respect to the Company, the Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, on all Outstanding Securities will
ipso facto
become due and payable without any declaration or other Act on the part of any Holder or the Trustee.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article V provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default.

exceeds the aggregate Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of the Securities or portions thereof which the Company is obligated to purchase as of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date then the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess to the Company.
 
 
 
 
Section 14.01
  
Right To Convert.
 
(a)
  
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder
s option, at any time following the Issue Date of the Securities hereunder through the close of business on the Stated Maturity to convert the Principal Amount of any such Securities, or any portion of such Principal Amount which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof at the Conversion Price then in effect:
 
 
(i)
  
during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter) commencing after June 30, 2006, if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading Days during the period of the 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on
, and including, the last Trading Day of the preceding fiscal quarter;
 
(ii)
  
prior to April 15, 2026 during the five Business Day period immediately following a five consecutive Trading Day period (the 
Measurement Period
) in which the Trading Price, as determined following a request by a Holder in accordance with
Section 14.01(d)
, for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on such Trading Day and the applicable Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day;
 
 
(iii)
  
at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date, if such Security has been called for redemption pursuant to Article XI hereof;
 
(iv)
  
as provided in Section 14.01(b); or
 
(v)
  
at any time during the period beginning 10 Trading Days before the Stated Maturity and until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity.
 
(b)
  
In addition, in the event that:
 
(i)
  
(A)
the Company elects to distribute to all holders of Common Stock certain rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 45 days, Common Stock at less than the Current Market Rate; or
 
(B)
  
the Company elects to distribute to holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase the Company
s securities, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company exceeding 10% of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration for such distribution;
 
then, in each case, the Company must notify, in writing, Holders of Securities of the occurrence of such an event at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for any such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date or the date of announcement by the Company that the distribution will not take place. No adjustment shall be made to the ability of a Holder of Securities to convert if such Holder may participate in the distribution without conversion;
 
(ii)
  
the Company becomes party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or sale of all or substantially all of the Company
s assets, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, a Holder may surrender the Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until and including the date which is 15 days after the actual date of the transaction. If the Company becomes party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, then at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert the Securities into Common Stock shall be changed into a right to convert such Securities into the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property which the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted such Securities immediately prior to the transaction (the 
Reference Property
). If the transaction causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property into which the Securities shall be convertible shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing. However, if the transaction described above also constitutes a Public Acquirer Change of Control then the Company may in certain circumstances elect to change the conversion right in the manner described in
Section 14.06
in lieu of changing the conversion right in the manner described in this
Section 14.01(b)
(ii);
 
(iii)
  
If a transaction described in Section 14.01(b)(ii) also constitutes a Fundamental Change, a Holder can require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its Securities as described in
Section 13.01
. In addition, a Holder may surrender all or a portion of the Holders Securities for conversion if a Fundamental Change of the type described in clause (i) of the definition of Change of Control occurs or a termination of trading occurs. In such event, a Holder may surrender Securities for conversion at any time beginning on the actual effective date of such Fundamental Change until and including the date which is 30 calendar days after the actual effective date of such transaction or, if later, until the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Fundamental Change.
 
(c)
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice or a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder
s option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with Article XII or Article XIII hereof prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date or the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be.
 
(d)
  
In connection with any potential conversion pursuant to Section 14.01
(a)(ii)
, the Bid Solicitation Agent shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price unless the Company has requested such determination, and the Company shall have no obligation to request such determination unless a Holder has provided the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price would be less than 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate. At such time as the Company has determined that a Holder has provided such evidence to the Company, the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent, in writing, to determine the Trading Price beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate. After receiving from a Holder any materials that purport to constitute such reasonable evidence, the Company shall promptly determine whether such material does constitute reasonable evidence for purposes of this
Section 14.01(d)
;
provided
that absent manifest error, the Companys determination shall be binding and final. The Company shall not be obligated to give any instructions to the Bid Solicitation Agent until the Company has completed its determination, which it shall do promptly.
 
Section 14.02
  
Conversion Procedure
.
 
(a)
  
Each Security shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent.
 
(b)
  
In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any Securities in certificated form, the Holder of any such Securities to be converted, in whole or in part, shall:
 
(i)
  
complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided on the back of the Security (the
Conversion Notice
) or facsimile of the conversion notice and deliver such notice to a Conversion Agent;
 
 
(ii)
  
surrender the Security to a Conversion Agent;
 
(iii)
  
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, if required; and
 
(iv)
  
pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
 
The date on which the Holder satisfies all of the requirements set forth in (i) through (iv) above is the 
Conversion Date
. Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be issued. All such Securities surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Securities, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or his duly authorized attorney.
 
In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any interest in Securities in global form, the Holder must complete the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to the Depositarys book-entry conversion program, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Trustee or Conversion Agent, and pay the funds, if any, required by this
Section 14.02
and any transfer taxes if required pursuant to
Section 14.08
.
 
(c)
  
As promptly as practicable after
the later of (i) the Conversion Date (but in no event later than 5 Business Days after the Conversion Date) or (ii) the date all the calculations necessary to make such payment and delivery have been made (but in no event later than as specified in
Section 14.03(c)
), subject to compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in a name other than that of the Holder (as if such transfer were a transfer of the Securities (or portion thereof) so converted), the Company shall issue and shall deliver to such Holder at the office of the Conversion Agent, a check or cash and a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance with the provisions of this Article XIV, if applicable. In case any Securities of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Securities so surrendered, without charge to him, new Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities.
 
Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Securities (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth above in this
Section 14.02
have been satisfied as to such Securities (or portion thereof), and the person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the Holder of record of the shares represented thereby;
provided, however
, that in case of any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, the person or persons in whose name the certificate or certificates for such shares are to be issued shall be deemed to have become the record Holder thereof for all purposes on the next day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date upon which such Securities shall be surrendered.
 
(d)
  
Upon the conversion of an interest in Global Securities, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company) shall make a notation on such Global Securities as to the reduction in the Principal Amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Securities effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
 
(e)
  
Each stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities that are Restricted Securities shall bear the legend in substantially the form of
Exhibit C
hereto.
 
Section 14.03
  
Payments Upon Conversion
.
 
(a)
  
Upon any conversion of any Security, the Company shall deliver to converting Holders, in respect of each $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities being converted, a
Settlement Amount
 equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amount for each of the 25 Trading Days during the Observation Period for such Security.
 
(b)
  
The 
Daily Settlement Amount
 for each of the 25 Trading Days during the Observation Period shall consist of:
 
(i)
  
cash equal to 1/25th of the l
esser of (x) $1,000 and (y) the Conversion Value, and
 
(ii)
  
to the extent the Conversion Value exceeds $1,000, a number of shares of Common Stock (the 
Remaining Shares
) equal to the Daily Share Amounts subject to the Companys right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such Remaining Shares set forth in
Section 14.10
;
 
provided
, that in no event shall the aggregate number of shares per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities exceed the Aggregate Share Cap.
 
(c)
  
The Company
shall deliver the Settlement Amount to converting Holders on or prior to the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the Observation Period.
 
(d)
  
Upon conversion, Holders will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest Amounts, if any, unless such conversion occurs between a Regular Record Date and the Interest Payment Date to which it relates.
 
(e)
  
The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities. If multiple Securities shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Securities, the Company shall make payment therefor in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable multiplied by the Current Market Price to the Holder of such Securities.
 
Section 14.04
  
Adjustment Of Conversion Rate
.
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows, except that the Company shall not make any adjustment if holders of Securities may participate, as a result of holding the Securities, in the transaction described without having to convert their Securities.
 
(a)
  
If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, pays a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, or if the Company subdivides or combines its Common Stock then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
CR
0
=
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event
 
CR' =
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such event
 
OS
0
=
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event
 
OS' =
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the date fixed for determination for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this
Section 14.04(a)
is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b)
  
If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issues to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock certain rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share) less than the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Record Date for stockholders entitled to receive such rights and warrants, which rights or warrants are exercisable for not more than 60 days
, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula (
provided
that the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration):
 
where,
 
 
 
 
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date of announcement of such issuance.
 
To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Closing Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
For the purposes of this
Section 14.04
(b)
, rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Companys capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (
Trigger Event
): (1) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (2) are not exercisable; and (3) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this
Section 14.04
(b)
(and no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 14.04(b) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 14.04(b). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(b) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all applicable holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
 
(c)
  
If the Company, at any time or from time to time while the Securities are outstanding, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common
Stock, shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company, evidences of its indebtedness or assets, including securities, but excluding
:
 
(i)
  
dividends or distributions referred to in
Section 14.04(a)
;
 
(ii)
  
rights or warrants referred to in
Section 14.04(b)
; and
 
(iii)
  
dividends or distributions referred to in
Section 14.04(d)
;
 
then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
  
   
   
where,
 
CR
0
=
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
 
CR' =
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
 
SP
0
=
 
the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Record Date for such distribution
 
FMV =
 
the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Record Date for such distribution
 
Such adjustment
shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution. If the Board of Directors of the Company determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock.
 
To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Securities into Common Stock, a Holder shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as if we distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this
Section 14.03(c)
where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a 
Spin-Off
), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the dividend or distribution for such for such Spin-Off shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
CR
0
=
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
 
CR' =
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
 
FMV
0
=
 
the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which Ex-Dividend Trading commences for such distribution on The Nasdaq National Market or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the Securities are then listed or quoted
 
MP
0
=
 
the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which Ex-Dividend Trading commences for such distribution on The Nasdaq National Market or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the Securities are then listed or quoted
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph will occur on the fourteenth Trading Day after the date on which Ex-Dividend Trading commences for such distribution on The Nasdaq National Market or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the Securities are then listed or quoted.
 
(d)
  
If any cash dividend or other distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
CR
0
=
 
the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date for such distribution
 
CR' =
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date for such distribution
 
SP
0
=
 
the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the Record Date for such distribution
 
C =
 
the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to holders of Common Stock.
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;
provided
that if such dividend or distribution is not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(e)
  
If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such tender offer or exchange offer is announced, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
CR
0
=
 
the Conversion Rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires
 
CR' =
 
the Conversion Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires
 
AC =
 
the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the aggregate consideration paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer
 
OS
0
=
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such tender or exchange offer is announced
 
OS' =
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding less any shares purchased in the tender or exchange offer at the time such tender or exchange offer expires
 
SP' =
 
the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such tender or exchange offer is announced.
 
If the Company is obligated to repurchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange had not been made.
 
(f)
  
For purposes of this
Section 14.04
, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:
 
(i)
  
Current Market Price
 on any date means the average of the Closing Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the day before the Record Date (or, if earlier, the Ex-Dividend Date) with respect to any distribution, issuance or other event requiring such computation.
 
(ii)
  
fair market value
 shall mean the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arms length transaction.
 
(iii)
  
Record Date
 shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the Holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
 
(g)
  
Subject to subsection (i) below, the Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to any adjustments required by
Section 14.04(a)
,
Section 14.04(b)
,
Section 14.04(c)
,
Section 14.04(d)
,
Section 14.04(e)
or
Section 14.04(f)
, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
 
(h)
  
To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to subsection (i) below, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
 
(i)
  
Any increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to subsections (g) and (h) above shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, as required by Rule 4350 of the Marketplace Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, result in the sale or issuance of 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock, or 20% of more of the voting power, outstanding as of the date of the Offering Memorandum.
 
(j)
  
No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such rate;
provided
,
however
, that any adjustments which by reason of this
Section 14.04(i)
are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article XIV shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. To the extent the Securities become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than Capital Stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
 
(k)
  
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder of Securities at such Holders last address appearing on the list of Security holders provided for in
Section 3.06
, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(l)
  
In any case in which this
Section 14.04
provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a Record Date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of any Securities converted after such Record Date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to
Section 14.03
.
 
(m)
  
For purposes of this
Section 14.04
, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
 
(n)
  
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this
Section 14.04
if the Holders of the Securities may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to this
Section 14.04
.
 
(o)
  
Whenever any provision of this Article XIV requires a calculation of an average of Closing Sale Prices or Daily VWAP over a span of multiple days, the Company shall make appropriate adjustments (determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs at any time during the period from which the average is to be calculated.
 
Section 14.05
  
Adjustments Upon Certain Fundamental Changes
.
 
(a)
  
If a Holder elects to convert Securities pursuant to
Section 14.01(b)(ii)
above in connection with a transaction described therein and the transaction (1) has an effective date occurring on or prior to May 15, 2013 and (2) constitutes a Fundamental Change, subject to
Section 14.06
below, the Conversion Rate for such Securities shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the 
Additional Shares
) as described below. Any conversion occurring at a time when the Securities would be convertible in light of the expected or actual occurrence of a Fundamental Change will be deemed to have occurred in connection with such Fundamental Change notwithstanding the fact that a Security may then be convertible because another condition to conversion has been satisfied.
 
(b)
  
The number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the 
Effective Date
) and the price (the 
Stock Price
) paid per share of Common Stock in the Fundamental Change. If the Fundamental Change is a transaction described in clause (ii) of the definition of Change in Control, and holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change.
 
(c)
  
The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Securities is otherwise adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares set forth in such table will be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in
Section 14.04
.
 
(d)
  
The table in Schedule A hereto sets forth the hypothetical stock price and the number of additional shares to be received per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities.
 
The exact Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table in Schedule A, in which case:
 
(i)
  
If the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year.
 
(ii)
  
If the Stock Price is greater than $1
6.00] per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion.
 
(iii)
  
If the Stock Price is less than $3.03 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 894 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities (789 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities if the Initial Purchasers exercise their over-allotment option granted by the Company pursuant to Section 2 of the Purchase Agreement), subject to adjustments in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in
Section 14.04
.
 
Section 14.06
  
Conversion After
A
Public Acquirer
Change Of Control
.
 
(a)
  
In the event of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may, in lieu of increasing the Conversion Rate by Additional Shares pursuant to
Section 14.05
, elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related conversion obligation such that from and after the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, Holders shall be entitled to convert their Securities, in accordance with
Section 14.01
, into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock, still subject to the arrangements for payment upon conversion in
Section 14.03
. The adjusted Conversion Rate shall be the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Change of Control multiplied by a fraction:
 
(i)
  
the numerator of which will be the average of the
Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, and
 
(ii)
  
the denominator of which will be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control.
 
(b)
  
In order to make the election pursuant to this
Section 14.06
, the Company and the issuer of the Public Acquirer Common Stock shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that each Security shall be exchangeable into Public Acquirer Common Stock and execute an amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement (to the extent any Registrable Securities (as defined therein) remain outstanding) to make the provisions thereof to apply to the Public Acquirer Common Stock. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for provisions and adjustments which shall be a nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the provisions and adjustments provided for in this Article XIV.
 
(c)
  
Within 10 Trading Days prior to but not including the expected effective date of a Fundamental Change that is also a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company will provide to all Holders and the Trustee and Paying Agent a notification, in a manner as provided in Section 1.06, stating whether the Company will:
 
(i)
  
elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and related conversion obligation
as set forth in this
Section 14.06
, in which case the Holders will not have the right to receive additional shares upon conversion, as described in Section 14.05; or
 
(ii)
  
not elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and related conversion obligation, in which case the Holders will have the right to convert Notes and, if applicable, receive Additional Shares upon conversion as described above in Section 14.05.
 
Section 14.07
  
Effect Of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger Or Sale
.
Except as otherwise provided in
Section 14.06
, if any of the following events occur, namely:
 
(i)
  
any reclassification or change of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, or any other change for which an adjustment is provided in
 
Section 14.04(c)
);
 
(ii)
  
any consolidation, merger or combination to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in outstanding shares of Common Stock; or
 
(iii)
  
any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock,
 
then the Company or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that such Securities shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available to convert all such Securities) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance. Assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance (
provided
that, if the kind or amount of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (
non-electing share
), then for the purposes of this
Section 14.07
, the kind and amount of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article XIV. If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, the stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
 
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this
Section 14.07
applies to any event or occurrence,
Section 14.04
shall not apply.
 
Section 14.08
  
Taxes On Shares Issued
. Any issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, transfer, stamp or any similar tax in respect of the issue thereof, and the Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Securities converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
 
Section 14.09
  
Reservation Of Shares; Shares To Be Fully Paid; Compliance With Governmental Requirements; Listing Of Common Stock
. The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Securities would be held by a single Holder).
 
Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.
 
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from any lien or adverse claim.
 
The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to list or cause to have quoted any shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Securities on each national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
 
Section 14.10
  
Payment Of Cash in Lieu Of Common Stock.
 
The Company may elect to pay cash to the Holders surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 14.03. In such event, on any day prior to the first Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period, the Company shall specify a percentage of the Daily Share Amount that shall be settled in cash (the 
Cash Percentage
) and the amount of cash that the Company shall pay in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Observation Period will equal the product of: (1) the Cash Percentage, (2) the Daily Share Amount for such Trading Day and (3) the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock for such Trading Day (provided that after the consummation of a Fundamental Change in which the consideration is comprised entirely of cash, the amount used in this clause (3) shall be the cash price per share received by holders of the Common Stock in such Fundamental Change). The number of shares that the Company shall deliver in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Observation Period will be a percentage of the Daily Share Amount equal to 100% minus the Cash Percentage. Upon making a determination that a percentage of the Daily Share Amount will be settled in cash, the Company shall promptly disclose such information on its website prior to the first Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period. If the Company does not specify a Cash Percentage by the start of the applicable Observation Period, the Company shall settle 100% of the Daily Share Amount for each Trading Day in the applicable Observation Period with shares of Common Stock;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion of Securities.
 
For the purposes of this Section 14.10, in the event that any of Conversion Value, Daily Share Amounts or Daily VWAP is not calculable for all portions of the Observation Period, the Companys Board of Directors shall in good faith determine the values necessary to calculate the Conversion Value, Daily Share Amounts and Daily VWAP, as applicable.
 
Section 14.11
  
Responsibility Of Trustee
.
The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Securities for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article XIV. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to
Section 14.07
relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Securities after any event referred to in such
Section 14.07
or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of
Section 6.01
, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
 
Section 14.12
  
Notice To Holders Prior To Certain Actions
.
In case,
 
(a)
  
the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the
Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 14.04
; or
 
(b)
  
the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; or
 
(c)
  
of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries; or
 
(d)
  
of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries;
 
then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities at such Holders address appearing on the list of Security holders provided for in
Section 3.06
of this Indenture, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
 
Section 14.13
  
Company Determination Final
.
Any determination that the Company or its Board of Directors must make pursuant to this Article XIV shall be conclusive if made in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of this Article XIV, absent manifest error, and set forth in a Board Resolution.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

that in the case of a Registration Default Period that is in effect solely as a result of a Registration Default of the type described in clause (iii) or (iv) of the preceding paragraph, such Additional Interest Amount, as applicable, shall be paid only to the Holders (as set forth in the succeeding paragraph) that have delivered Notices and Questionnaires that caused the Company to incur the obligations set forth in
Section 2
(d)
the non-performance of which is the basis of such Registration Default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Interest Amount shall accrue as to any Registrable Security from and after the earlier of (x) the date such security is no longer a Registrable Security and (y) expiration of the Effectiveness Period. The rate of accrual of the Additional Interest Amount with respect to any period shall not exceed the rate provided for in this paragraph notwithstanding the occurrence of multiple concurrent Registration Defaults.
 
The Additional Interest Amount shall accrue from the first day of the applicable Registration Default Period, and shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date during the Registration Default Period (and on the Interest Payment Date next succeeding the end of the Registration Default Period if the Registration Default Period does not end on a Interest Payment Date) to the Record Holders of the Registrable Securities that are Notes entitled thereto;
provided
that any Additional Interest Amount accrued with respect to any Note or portion thereof redeemed by the Company on a redemption date, purchased by the Company on a repurchase date prior to the Interest Payment Date, shall, in any such event, be paid instead to the Holder who submitted such Note or portion thereof for redemption or purchase on the applicable redemption date or repurchase date, as the case may be, on such date (or promptly following the conversion date, in the case of conversion), unless the redemption date or the repurchase date, as the case may be, falls after May 1 or November 1 and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; and
provided further
, that, in the case of a Registration Default of the type described in clause (iii) or (iv) of the first paragraph of this
Section 2(e)
such Additional Interest Amount shall be paid only to the Holders entitled thereto by check mailed to the address set forth in the Notice and Questionnaire delivered by such Holder. If a holder has converted some or all of its Notes into Underlying Common Stock, the holder will not be entitled to receive any Additional Interest Amount with respect to such Underlying Common Stock or the principal amount of the Note that have been so converted. In addition, in no event will any Additional Interest Amount be payable in connection with a Registration Default relating to a failure to register the Underlying Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Notes. For avoidance of doubt, if the Company fails to register both the Notes and the Underlying Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, then any Additional Interest Amount will be payable in connection with the Registration Default relating to the failure to register the Notes. The Trustee shall be entitled, on behalf of registered holders of Notes or Underlying Common Stock, to seek any available remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement, including, with respect to holders of the Notes, for the payment of such Additional Interest Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the sole damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to which additional interest are expressly provided shall be such additional interest. Nothing shall preclude any Holder from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to this Agreement.
 
All of the Companys obligations set forth in this
Section 2(e)
that are outstanding with respect to any Registrable Security at the time such security ceases to be a Registrable Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security have been satisfied in full (notwithstanding termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8(k)
).
 
The parties hereto agree that the additional interest provided for in this
Section 2(e)
constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by Holders of Notes by reason of the failure of a Shelf Registration Statement to be filed or declared effective or available for effecting resales of Notes in accordance with the provisions hereof.
 
Section 3
  
. Registration Procedures.
In connection with the registration obligations of the Company under
Section 2
hereof, the Company shall:

Section 3
(h)
prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and use its best efforts to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement during the Effectiveness Period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement as so amended or such Prospectus as so supplemented.
 
(c)
  
As promptly as practicable give notice to the Notice Holders, the Initial Purchasers and the Special Counsel,
(i)
when any Prospectus, prospectus supplement, Shelf Registration Statement or post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration Statement has been filed with the SEC and, with respect to a Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has been declared effective,
(ii)
of any request, following the effectiveness of the initial Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act, by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to any Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for additional information,
(iii)
of the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for that purpose,
(iv)
of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose,
(v)
of the occurrence of, but not the nature of or details concerning, a Material Event and
(vi)
of the determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration Statement will be filed with the SEC, which notice may, at the discretion of the Company (or as required pursuant to
Section 3
(h)
) state that it constitutes a Deferral Notice, in which event the provisions of
Section 3
(h)
shall apply.
 
(d)
  
Use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction in which they have been qualified for sale, in either case at the earliest possible moment, and provide immediate notice to each Notice Holder and the Initial Purchasers of the withdrawal of any such order.
 
(e)
  
As promptly as practicable furnish to each Notice Holder, the Special Counsel and the Initial Purchaser, upon request and without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, including exhibits and all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
 
(f)
  
During the Effectiveness Period, deliver to each Notice Holder, the Special Counsel, if any, and the Initial Purchaser, in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Notice Holder may reasonably request; and the Company hereby consents (except during such periods that a Deferral Notice is outstanding and has not been revoked) to the use of such Prospectus or each amendment or supplement thereto by each Notice Holder in connection with any offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in the manner set forth therein.
 
(g)
  
Prior to any public offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, use its best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the Notice Holders and the Special Counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Notice Holder reasonably requests in writing (which request may be included in the Notice and Questionnaire); prior to any public offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period in connection with such Notice Holders offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities in the manner set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus;
provided
that the Company will not be required to
(i)
qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Agreement or
(ii)
take any action that would subject it to general service of process in suits or to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.
 
(h)
  
Upon (A) the issuance by the SEC of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation of proceedings with respect to a Shelf Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the Securities Act, (B) the occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact (a 
Material Event
) as a result of which a Shelf Registration Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any Prospectus shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development that, in the reasonable discretion of the Company, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of a Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus:
 
(i)
  
in the case of clause (B) above, as promptly as practicable prepare and file, if necessary pursuant to applicable law, a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document that would be incorporated by reference into such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus so that such Shelf Registration Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and such Prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, and, in the case of a post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration Statement, use its best efforts to cause it to be declared effective as promptly as is practicable, and
 
 
(ii)
  
give notice to the Notice Holders, and the Special Counsel, if any, that the availability of a Shelf Registration Statement is suspended (a 
Deferral Notice
).
 
The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed (x) in the case of clause (A) above, as promptly as is practicable, (y) in the case of clause (B) above, as soon as, in the sole judgment of the Company, public disclosure of such Material Event would not be prejudicial to or contrary to the interests of the Company or, if necessary to avoid unreasonable burden or expense, as soon as practicable thereafter and (z) in the case of clause (C) above, as soon as in the reasonable discretion of the Company, such suspension is no longer appropriate. The Company shall be entitled to exercise its right under this
Section 3
(h)
to suspend the availability of a Shelf Registration Statement or any Prospectus, without incurring or accruing any obligation to pay additional interest or liquidated damages pursuant to
Section 2(e)
, no more than once in any three month period or three times in any twelve month period, and any such period during which the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and any Prospectus is suspended (the 
Deferral Period
) shall, without incurring any obligation to pay additional interest or liquidated damages pursuant to
Section 2(e)
, not exceed 30 days;
provided
that the aggregate duration of any Deferral Periods shall not exceed 30 days in any three month period (or 60 days in any three month period in the event of a Material Event pursuant to which the Company has delivered a second notice as required below) or 90 days in any 12 month period;
provided
that in the case of a Material Event relating to an acquisition or a probable acquisition or financing, recapitalization, business combination or other similar transaction, the Company may, without incurring any obligation to pay additional interest or liquidated damages pursuant to
Section 2(e)
, deliver to Notice Holders a second notice to the effect set forth above, which shall have the effect of extending the Deferral Period by up to an additional 30 days, or such shorter period of time as is specified in such second notice.
 
(i)
  
If requested in writing in connection with a disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, make reasonably available for inspection during normal business hours by a representative for the Notice Holders of such Registrable Securities, any broker-dealers, attorneys and accountants retained by such Notice Holders, and any attorneys or other agents retained by a broker-dealer engaged by such Notice Holders, all relevant financial and other records and pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the appropriate officers, directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to make reasonably available for inspection during normal business hours on reasonable notice all relevant information reasonably requested by such representative for the Notice Holders, or any such broker-dealers, attorneys or accountants in connection with such disposition, in each case as is customary for similar due diligence examinations;
provided
that such persons shall first agree in writing with the Company that any non-public information shall be used solely for the purposes of satisfying due diligence obligations under the Securities Act and exercising rights under this Agreement and shall be kept confidential by such persons, unless
(i)
disclosure of such information is required by court or administrative order or is necessary to respond to inquiries of regulatory authorities,
(ii)
in the opinion of Special Counsel, disclosure of such information is required by law (including any disclosure requirements pursuant to federal securities laws in connection with the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement or the use of any prospectus referred to in this Agreement),
(iii)
such information becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure or failure to safeguard by any such person or
(iv)
such information becomes available to any such person from a source other than the Company and such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement, and
provided further
that the foregoing inspection and information gathering shall, to the greatest extent possible, be coordinated on behalf of all the Notice Holders and the other parties entitled thereto by the Special Counsel. Any person legally compelled to disclose any such confidential information made available for inspection shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.
 
(j)
  
Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in all material respects and make generally available to its securityholders earning statements (which need not be audited) satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) for a 12-month period commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company commencing after the effective date of a Shelf Registration Statement, which statements shall be made available no later than 45 days after the end of the 12-month period or 90 days if the 12-month period coincides with the fiscal year of the Company.
 
(k)
  
Use its best efforts to cooperate with each Notice Holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities sold or to be sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends, and cause such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations as are permitted by the Indenture and registered in such names as such Notice Holder may request in writing at least one Business Day prior to any sale of such Registrable Securities.
 
(l)
  
Provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities covered by each Shelf Registration Statement not later than the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement and provide the Trustee and the transfer agent for the Common Stock with printed certificates for the Registrable Securities that are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company.
 
(m)
  
Use its best efforts to cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
 
(n)

(i)
the filing of the initial Shelf Registration Statement and
(ii)
the effectiveness of the initial Shelf Registration Statement, announce the same, in each case by release to Reuters Economic Services and Bloomberg Business News.
 
Section 4
  
. Holders Obligations.
(a) Each Holder agrees, by acquisition of the Registrable Securities, that no Holder shall be entitled to sell any of such Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto, unless such Holder has furnished the Company with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant to
Section 2(d)
hereof (including the information required to be included in such Notice and Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence. Each Notice Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Notice Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such Notice Holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request. Any sale of any Registrable Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and warranty by such Holder that the information relating to such Holder and its plan of distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by such Holder in connection with such disposition, that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution and that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale omit to state any material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution necessary to make the statements in such Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
 
(b)
 
 
Upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, each Notice Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement until such Notice Holders receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in
Section 3(h)(i)
, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the Prospectus may be used.
 
(c)
 
 
In the event of a sale of Registrable Securities by the Holder under the Registration Statement, if requested by the Company, the Holder shall deliver to the Companys transfer agent, with a copy to the Company, a Certificate of Subsequent Sale substantially in the form attached here to as Exhibit A.
 
Section 5
  
. Registration Expenses.
The Company shall bear all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations under Sections
2
and
3
of this Agreement whether or not any Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective. Such fees and expenses shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without limitation, fees and expenses (x) with respect to filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and (y) of compliance with federal and state securities or Blue Sky laws (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of the Special Counsel in connection with Blue Sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as Notice Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement may designate), (ii) printing expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of printing certificates for Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company), (iii) duplication expenses relating to copies of any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus delivered to any Holders hereunder, (iv) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement, (v) reasonable fees and disbursements of the Trustee and its counsel and of the registrar and transfer agent for the Common Stock, (vi) Securities Act liability insurance obtained by the Company in its sole discretion and (vii) the reasonable fees and disbursements of Special Counsel. In addition, the Company shall pay the internal expenses of the Company (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit, the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing by the Company of the Registrable Securities on any securities exchange on which similar securities of the Company are then listed and the fees and expenses of any person, including special experts, retained by the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 5
, each seller of Registrable Securities shall pay any brokers commission, agency fee or underwriters discount or commission in connection with the sale of the Registrable Securities under a Shelf Registration Statement.
 
Section 6
  
. Indemnification and Contribution.
 
 
(a)
  
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Notice Holder, each person, if any, who controls any Notice Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Notice Holder within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Shelf Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein
.
 
(b)
  
Each Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, its officers who sign any Shelf Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) or any other Holder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Holder, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto. In no event shall the liability of any Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
 
(c)
  
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
Section 6(a)
or
6(b)
hereof, such person (the 
indemnified party
) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the 
indemnifying party
) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless
(i)
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or
(ii)
the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
Section 6(a)
, the Holders of a majority (with Holders of Notes deemed to be the Holders, for purposes of determining such majority, of the number of shares of Underlying Common Stock into which such Notes are or would be convertible as of the date on which such designation is made) of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement held by Holders that are indemnified parties pursuant to
Section 6(a)
and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
Section 6(b)
, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d)
  
To the extent that the indemnification provided for in
Section 6(a)
or
6(b)
is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(i)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand or
(ii)
if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the initial placement pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) of the Registrable Securities to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate. The relative benefits received by any Holder shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving registration rights under this Agreement for the Registrable Securities. The relative fault of the Holders on the one hand and the Company on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Holders or by the Company, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this
Section 6
(d)
are several in proportion to the respective number of Registrable Securities they have sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, and not joint.
 
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 6(d)
were determined by
pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding this
Section 6
(d)
, no indemnifying party that is a selling Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities sold by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e)
  
The remedies provided for in this
Section 6
are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity, hereunder, under the Purchase Agreement or otherwise.
 
(f)
  
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
Section 6
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
(i)
any termination of this Agreement,
(ii)
any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder, any person controlling any Holder or any affiliate of any Holder or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and
(iii)
the sale of any Registrable Securities by any Holder.
 
Section 7
  
. Information Requirements.
The Company covenants that, if at any time before the end of the Effectiveness Period, the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will cooperate with any Holder and take such further reasonable action as any Holder may reasonably request in writing (including, without limitation, making such reasonable representations as any such Holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the Securities Act and customarily taken in connection with sales pursuant to such exemptions. Upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements, unless such a statement has been included in the Companys most recent report filed pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 7
shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities (other than the Common Stock) under the Exchange Act.
 
Section 8
  
. Miscellaneous.
 
 
(a)
  
No Conflicting Agreements.
The Company is not, as of the date hereof, a party to, nor shall it, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that conflicts with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement. The Company represents and warrants that the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with the rights granted to the holders of the Companys securities under any other agreements.
 
(b)
  
Amendments and Waivers.
The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the then outstanding Underlying Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities (with Holders of Notes deemed to be the Holders, for purposes of this Section, of the number of outstanding shares of Underlying Common Stock into which such Notes are or would be convertible as of the date on which such consent is requested). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement;
provided
that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Agreement may be amended by written agreement signed by the Company and the Initial Purchaser, without the consent of the Holders of Registrable Securities, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Agreement that shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Registrable Securities. Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this
Section 8(b)
whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder.
 
(c)

Milpitas, California, May 17, 2006 -
JDSU today announced that it has completed the sale of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 1% senior convertible notes due 2026. JPMorgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. served as joint book runners of the offering.
The completion of this senior convertible offering will further strengthen JDSUs balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents now in excess of $1.2 billion, said Dave Vellequette, JDSUs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With our previous convertible notes coming due in 2008, we decided to act opportunistically to raise additional funds at attractive terms.
The Company has the right to redeem the notes beginning May 20, 2013. Holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase the notes on May 15, 2013, May 15, 2016, and May 15, 2021. JDSU intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of existing debt.
The Company sold the notes in a private transaction, exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes, and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States (or to a U.S. person) without registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state laws. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy, these securities.
