Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On June 5, 2006, JDS Uniphase Corporation (the Company) sold an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 (the Additional Notes) to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Additional Notes were issued upon the exercise by the initial purchasers of an over-allotment option granted by the Company. The Company previously issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 on May 17, 2006 (the Initial Notes and, together with the Additional Notes, the Notes). The issuance of the Additional Notes brings the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding to $425 million.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of May 17, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Indenture). The descriptions of the terms of the Indenture and Notes in this Item 2.03 are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2006. The Notes mature on May 15, 2026. The Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations, will rank equal in right of payment with our other senior unsecured debt and senior to all our future subordinated debt.
 
Holders may convert the Notes into cash and shares of the Companys common stock, if any, based on a conversion rate of 264.0264 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment, prior to stated maturity under the following circumstances:
(1) if the closing price of the common stock reaches, or the
 
trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds; (2) if the Notes have been called for redemption;
 
(3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions; or (4) during
 
the ten trading days prior to, but not on, the maturity date.
 
Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the Notes on each of May 15, 2013, May 15, 2016 and May 15, 2021 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. In addition, upon certain fundamental changes, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date.
The Company may not redeem the notes before May 20, 2013. On or after that date, the Company may redeem all or part of the notes for cash at 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
 
The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, may be declared immediately due and payable. These amounts automatically become due and payable if an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs.
 
Holders of the Notes are entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 17, 2006, among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as initial purchasers (the Registration Rights Agreement). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering resales of the Notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. The description of the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement in this Item 2.03 is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Payment of the principal of this Security shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Holder of this Security specified in the register of Securities, or, at the option of the Holder of this Security, at the Corporate Trust Office, in such lawful money of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company, designated as its 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 (herein called the 
Securities
), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 17, 2006 (herein called the 
Indenture
), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (herein called the 
Trustee
), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities.
 
The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and ranks equally with the Companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

Repurchase Date
) in integral multiples of $1,000 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the Principal Amount of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, up to, but excluding, such Repurchase Date (the 
Repurchase Price

Purchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder upon a Fundamental Change

At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the Securities, in cash, if a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to May 15, 2026 at a price equal to the Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date (the

If cash sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased on a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on the Business Day following the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, upon surrender of such Security).
 
Conversion
. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including without limitation the conditions of conversion of this Security set forth in 14.01 thereof), the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, to convert the Principal Amount hereof or any portion of such principal which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into, subject to 14.02 of the Indenture, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, at the Conversion Rate. The initial Conversion Rate is 264.0264 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities (equivalent to a conversion price of $3.79 (the 
Conversion Price
)), subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, based on a Daily Conversion Value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the Observation Period, as set forth in the Indenture. No fractional shares will be issued upon any conversion, but an adjustment and payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Securities for conversion. Securities in respect of which a Holder is exercising its right to require repurchase on a Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date may be converted only if such Holder withdraws its election to exercise such right in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
 
Upon conversion, the Company shall deliver, for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities being converted, cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 or (ii) the Conversion Value. To the extent the Conversion Value exceeds $1,000, the Company may choose to deliver cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Indenture.
 
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Security, including an exchange, transfer, repurchase or conversion of this Security in part only, the Trustee, as
 
 
 
 
custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.
 
Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, at any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, upon the request of a Holder of a Restricted Security, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished Rule 144A Information (as defined below) to such Holder of Restricted Securities, or to a prospective purchaser of any such security designated by any such Holder, to the extent required to permit compliance by any such Holder with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
Securities Act
). 
Rule 144A Information
 shall be such information as is specified pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto).
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of Outstanding Securities a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of said principal hereof on or after the respective due dates expressed herein or for the enforcement of any conversion right.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the Principal Amount, Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase
 
 
 
 
Price of, and interest, including Additional Interest Amounts, if any, on, this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin, currency or shares, herein prescribed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company may, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the Securities, amend the obligation of the Company to repurchase Securities upon a Fundamental Change.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate Principal Amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate Principal Amount of Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
