Exhibit 99.1
 JDSU today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2006.
Milpitas, California, August 30, 2006
GAAP net revenue for the fourth quarter of $318.2 million grew 86% year-over-year, due primarily to 25% growth in the Optical Communications business and the addition of the Communications Test and Measurement segment in August last year. For fiscal year 2006, GAAP net revenue of $1,204.3 million grew 69% from $712.2 million in fiscal 2005.
Fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $(45.8) million compares to a GAAP net loss of $(145.7) million in the year-ago quarter, and to GAAP net income of $3.7 million in the third quarter. For fiscal year 2006, GAAP net loss of $(151.2) improved from a loss of $(261.3) million reported for fiscal 2005. On a per share basis, GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter narrowed from $(0.10) a year ago, to $(0.03), and compares to approximately breakeven in the third quarter. Fiscal 2006 GAAP net loss per share of $(0.09) compares to a GAAP net loss per share of $(0.18) in fiscal 2005.
JDSU delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EBITDA of $5.5 million compares to a loss of $(19.0) million in the year-ago quarter, and to earnings of $7.9 million in the prior quarter. For fiscal 2006, non-GAAP EBITDA of $17.2 million compares to fiscal 2005's loss of $(70.5) million.
On a non-GAAP basis, net loss of $(2.1) million compares to a net loss of $(20.5) million in the year-ago quarter, and to a net loss of $(2.8) million in the prior quarter. For fiscal year 2006, non-GAAP net loss of $(23.8) million improved from the net loss of $(86.9) million reported for fiscal 2005. On a per share basis, fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $(0.00) improved from a net loss of $(0.01) per share a year ago, and compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $(0.00) in the prior quarter. For fiscal 2006, non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.01) improved from fiscal 2005's non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.06).
"Year-over-year revenue growth and improved profitability metrics highlight JDSU's advancement towards a profitable and sustainable business model," said Kevin Kennedy, JDSU's Chief Executive Officer. "We remain committed to further execution of our improvement programs throughout fiscal 2007, while at the same time continuing our investment and innovation in the broadband and optics markets."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA financial measures as supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. The Company evaluates Company-wide segment performance using, among other things, the measures disclosed in this release for the purposes of evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as its performance relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses these items to further its own understanding of the Company's core operating performance. The Company believes its "core operating performance" represents the Company's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" those items, such as those relating to restructuring, investing, stock-based compensation expense and non-cash activities, that management does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities.
The Company believes that providing this information to its investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows investors to see Company results "through the eyes" of management. The Company further believes that providing this information allows Company investors to both better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
The non-GAAP adjustments described in this release have historically been excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below:
Restructuring Activities
Cost of goods sold, costs of research and development and costs of selling, general and administrative related to restructuring events: The Company has incurred periodic expenses, included in its GAAP presentation of gross margin and operating expenses primarily due to additional depreciation from changes in estimated useful life and the write-down of certain property and equipment that has been identified for disposal but remained in use until the date of disposal, workforce related charges such as retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to a formal restructuring plan, building costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain facilities and equipment from buildings which the Company has disposed of or plans to dispose. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not reflect expected future gross profits or operating expenses nor does the Company believe that they provide a meaningful evaluation of current versus past core operational performance.
JDSU News Release
Restructuring expense primarily due to severance, lease and manufacturing costs: The Company has incurred restructuring expenses, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, primarily due to workforce related charges such as payments for severance and benefits and estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments related to a formal restructuring plan. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not reflect expected future operating expenses nor does the Company believe that they provide a meaningful evaluation of current versus past core operational performance.
Investment Activities
Gain or loss on sale of available for-sale investments and reduction in the fair value of investments: The Company has sold investments or adjusted the value of investments from time to time based on market conditions. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business does not include making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets. Moreover, the amount and timing of gains and losses and adjustments to the value of investments are unpredictable. Consequently, the Company believes that gains or losses on these sales and adjustments to the value of investments are not related to the ongoing core business and operating performance of the Company. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of the Company's core operating performance.
Gain or loss on equity method investments: The Company records gains or losses on its equity investments based on our pro-rata share of gains or the net losses of the investment. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business is not making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of gains or losses are unpredictable, as they are inherently based on the performance of the third party subject of a particular investment. Gains and losses in equity investments are unpredictable, and are primarily dependent on the financial performance of the company in which we have our investment. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
Stock-based compensation expense: Non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share excludes stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for fiscal 2006, and under APB 25 for earlier comparative periods. The Company excludes this item, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-
JDSU News Release
GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes this GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
Non-Cash Activities
Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions: The Company incurs amortization of intangibles, included in its GAAP presentation of gross profit and operating expense, related to the various acquisitions it has made. Management excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that eliminating this expense from operating income is useful to investors because it believes the GAAP measure, alone, is not indicative of its core operating expenses and performance.
Reduction of goodwill and other long-lived assets: The Company incurs costs, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, related to the reduction of the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets primarily related to SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 adjustments, respectively. SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 adjustments typically occur when the financial performance of the business utilizing the affected assets falls below certain thresholds or certain assets are designated as held for sale. Accordingly, SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 related asset value reductions are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this item, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, is useful to investors. We believe this non-GAAP adjustment will assist investors to compare current versus past performance. The Company's historical adjustments to the carrying value of certain of its assets under SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, as well as the methodology used by the Company in assessing the same, are more particularly described in its quarterly reports on form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.
Interest, taxes, and depreciation expense: The Company incurs depreciation expense in its operating results. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP EBITDA excludes items as a result of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is indicative of the Company's core operational cash flow.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development: The Company recorded charges for acquired in-process research and development, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, in connection with its acquisitions. These amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses. There can be no assurance that acquisition of businesses, products or technologies in the future will not result in substantial charges for acquired IPR&D. Accordingly, acquired IPR&D are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this expense, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP EBITDA, is useful to investors.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross margin is gross margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating expense is operating expense. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net loss is net loss. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net loss per share is net loss per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP EBITDA is loss from operations. The Company believes that these GAAP measures alone are not indicative of its core operating expenses and performance. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information is set forth below.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense, net loss, net loss per share, and EBITDA financial measures to GAAP (in millions, except per share amounts):
