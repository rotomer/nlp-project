Kennedy entered into, an employment agreement (the Agreement) replacing Mr. Kennedys previous employment agreement dated September 1, 2003 (the Former Agreement). The Former Agreement had an original term of September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2007. Pursuant to the Agreement the term commenced on September 1, 2007 and shall expire on August 31, 2009, subject to being automatically renewed for additional periods of one year each unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
Mr. Kennedys base salary under the Agreement is $800,000, retroactive to September 1, 2007. In addition, Mr. Kennedy is eligible to earn an annual bonus under the Companys established incentive plan(s) for senior executives with a target bonus of 100% of his annual base salary and a range of potential bonus from 0% to a maximum bonus of up to 125% of his annual base salary, based upon achievement of objectives determined by the Company from time to time. Mr. Kennedy is also eligible to participate in an individual performance-based bonus program (the CEO Incentive Plan) with performance targets to be established by the Companys Board of Directors and reasonably agreed upon by Mr. Kennedy (the CEO Bonus Targets). Under the CEO Incentive Plan, subject to achievement of minimum performance criteria, Mr. Kennedy is eligible to receive a minimum bonus of 50% of his annual base salary, and a maximum bonus of up to 125% of his annual base salary. Any bonus paid to Mr. Kennedy under the Companys established incentive plan(s) for senior executives shall be a credit against and will be deducted from any obligation of the Company to Mr. Kennedy under the CEO Incentive Plan.
Within thirty days from October 1, 2007, the Company will award Mr. Kennedy a grant of 175,000 deferred stock units which will be fully vested upon the date of grant, such shares to be delivered to Mr. Kennedy upon the sooner to occur of: (i) the date upon which Mr. Kennedys service to the Company terminates for any reason; (ii) upon a change of control (as defined in the Agreement), or (iii) on the second anniversary of the date of the grant of the deferred stock units.
Within thirty days from October 1, 2007, the Company also will award Mr. Kennedy a grant of 200,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) under the Companys then effective equity incentive plan(s). This award shall vest in equal installments on each of the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant.
Pursuant to the Agreement, no later than the last business day of the first fiscal quarter of the Companys 2009 fiscal year the Company will award Mr. Kennedy a grant of a minimum of 375,000 RSUs under the Companys then effective equity incentive plan(s). This award shall be subject to the following conditions of vesting:
The Agreement provides that in the event of a qualifying termination, Mr. Kennedy will be entitled to receive (i) a benefit equivalent to three years salary, at Mr. Kennedys annual salary in effect on the effective date of the event, plus three years bonus (calculated based upon Mr. Kennedys at target bonus under the CEO Incentive Plan), (ii) three years of accelerated vesting of unvested stock options and other securities or similar incentives held at the time of termination and (iii) reimbursement of COBRA premiums for up to eighteen months and a lump sum payment equal to the cost of reasonably comparable health insurance benefits for six months. A qualifying termination under the Agreement is any termination by the Company other than for cause or any voluntary termination for good reason, both as defined in the Agreement.
The Agreement provides that as soon as reasonably practicable the Company will procure a policy of insurance which shall provide that if Mr. Kennedys employment is terminated as the result of his death or disability, a benefit equivalent to three years salary, at Mr. Kennedys annual salary in effect on the effective date of the event, plus three years bonus calculated based upon Mr. Kennedys at target bonus under the CEO Incentive Plan, shall be paid to Mr. Kennedy and/or Mr. Kennedys estate or heirs as may be designated by Mr. Kennedy at his sole discretion.

14.
 
Compliance with Code Section 409A
 
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Code section 409A, as in effect from time to time. The intent of this Section 14 is that Employee not be subject to any tax liability or penalty by reason of the application of Code section 409A(a)(1) with respect to any amount payable under this Agreement. In consideration of the fact that any payments under Employees Prior Employment Agreement would not have been subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, if the Employee is subject to any liability under Code section 409A within twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, or with respect to any payment made to the Employee on account of his termination of employment within such twelve-month period, the Company shall indemnify the Employee on an after-tax basis for all such liability. To the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting certain payments to a specified employee within six (6) months of such employees separation from service), any payment hereunder that may be made to the Employee on account of his termination of employment with the Company shall be delayed only to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i).
 
15.
 
Date of Agreement
 
The parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.
 
(a)
  
Subject to and as provided by Section 5(f) of this Agreement, in the event it shall be determined that any payment, award, benefit or distribution (or any acceleration of any payment, award, benefit or distribution) by the Company (or any of its affiliated entities) or any entity which effectuates a Change of Control (or any of its affiliated entities) to or for the benefit of Employee (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Appendix A) (the Payments) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), or any interest or penalties are incurred by Employee with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then the Company shall pay to Employee an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Employee from the Gross-Up Payment of all taxes (including any Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Employee retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the sum of (x) the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments and (y) the product of any deductions disallowed because of the inclusion of the Gross-Up Payment in Employees adjusted gross income and the highest applicable marginal rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee shall be deemed to (i) pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rates of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, (ii) pay applicable state and local income taxes in the state and locality in which Employee is subject to taxation at the highest marginal rate of taxation in each state and locality for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes and (iii) have otherwise allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes at least equal to those which could be disallowed because of the inclusion of the Gross-Up Payment in the Employees adjusted gross income.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Appendix A, if it shall be determined that Employee is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments would not be subject to the Excise Tax if the Payments were reduced by an amount that is less than 10% of the portion of the Payments that would be treated as parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code, then the amounts payable to Employee under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the maximum amount that could be paid to Employee without giving rise to the Excise Tax (the Safe Harbor Cap), and no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Employee.
The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing any cash payments, unless an alternative method of reduction is elected by Employee. For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. If the reduction of the amounts payable hereunder would not result in a reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap, no amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this provision.
 
(b)
  
Subject to the provisions of this Appendix A (a), all determinations required to be made under this Appendix A, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, the reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by the public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change of Control (the Accounting Firm) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Employee within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice from the Company or the Employee that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company (collectively, the Determination). In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, Employee may appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company and the Company shall enter into any reasonable agreement requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with the performance of the services hereunder. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Employee, it shall furnish Employee with a written opinion to such effect, and to the effect that failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on Employees applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. In the event the Accounting Firm determines that the Payments shall be reduced to the Safe Harbor Cap, it shall furnish Employee with a written opinion to such effect. The Determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Employee. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (Underpayment) or Gross-Up Payments are made by the Company which should not have been made (Overpayment), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Employee thereafter is required to make payment of any Excise Tax or additional Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment (together with interest, to the extent not already within the Excise Tax, at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee. In the event the amount of the Gross-Up Payment exceeds the amount necessary to reimburse the Employee for his Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Overpayment that has been made and any such Overpayment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) shall be promptly paid by Employee (to the extent he has received a refund if the applicable Excise Tax has been paid to the Internal Revenue Service) to or for the benefit of the Company. Employee shall cooperate, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the Excise Tax.

Conversion of Units and Issuance of Shares
.
 
(a)
  
Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) or Section 4(c) and subject to the tax withholding requirements set forth in Section 7, one (1) share of Common Stock (each a Share) shall be issued to the Grantee in settlement of each Unit then subject to the Award on the date which is the first to occur of (i) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Date of Award, (ii) the date on which a Change of Control (as defined by the Employment Agreement) is consummated or (iii) the date of the Grantees Separation from Service within the meaning of Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Code Section 409A (the Section 409A Regulations).
 
(b)
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Shares would otherwise be issued on account of the Grantees Separation from Service on a date on which the Grantee is a specified employee (as such term is defined by the Section 409A Regulations), such Shares shall instead be issued on the first (1st) business day of the seventh (7th) calendar month commencing after the date of the Grantees Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of the Grantees death following the Grantees Separation from Service.
 
(c)
  
On the Award Date, one (1) Share shall be issued to the Grantee and simultaneously withheld by the Company pursuant to Section 6(b)(iii) in settlement of that number of Units having a value (as measured by the Fair Market Value of the Shares underling such Units) equal to the Grantees Tax Withholding Obligations (as defined in Section 6(b)) arising as a result of the grant to the Grantee of fully vested Units, including such Tax Withholding Obligations which result from the pyramiding of income tax withholding applicable to the issuance of such Shares.
 
5.
  
Right to Shares
. The Grantee shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to the Grantee.
 
6.
  
Taxes
.
 
(a)
  
Generally
. The Grantee is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Grantee in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company or any Affiliate takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Award. The Company and its Affiliates do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantees tax liability.
 
(b)
  
Payment of Withholding Taxes
. Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether U.S., federal, state or local, or non-U.S., including any employment tax obligation (the Tax Withholding Obligation), the Grantee must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company.
 
(i)
  
By Sale of Shares
. Unless the Grantee determines (or is required) to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (ii) or clause (iii) below, the Grantees acceptance of this Award constitutes the Grantees instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on the Grantees behalf a whole number of Shares from those Shares issuable to the Grantee as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such Shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. The Grantee will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and the Grantee agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Grantees minimum Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to the Grantee. The Grantee acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Grantees minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, the Grantee agrees to pay to the Company or any Affiliate as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above.
 
(ii)
  
By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means
. Unless the Grantee is required to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by means of clause (iii) below, at any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises (e.g., a vesting date), the Grantee may elect to satisfy the Grantees Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Administrator.
 
(iii)
  
By Withholding of Shares
. The Company may require the Grantee to satisfy all or any portion of the Tax Withholding Obligations by deducting from the Shares otherwise deliverable to the Grantee in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the Tax Withholding Obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.
 
(c)
  
Right to Retain Shares
. The Company may refuse to issue any Shares to the Grantee until the Grantee satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company has the right to retain without notice from Shares issuable under the Award or from salary or other amounts payable to the Grantee, Shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.
 
7.
  
Entire Agreement: Governing Law
. The Notice, the Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and the Grantee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Grantees interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee. These agreements are to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of California to the rights and duties of the parties. Should any provision of the Notice or this Agreement be determined by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the Administrator may amend this Agreement, either retroactively or prospectively, without the consent of the Grantee, if the Administrator determines in its discretion that such amendment is required or advisable for this Agreement and the Award to satisfy or comply with or meet the requirements of Code Section 409A. To the extent the Award is otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A, the Administrator shall not take any action that would cause the Award to become subject to Code Section 409A, and to the extent the Award is subject to Code Section 409A, the Administrator shall not take any action that would cause the Award to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A.

9.
  
Dispute Resolution
. The provisions of this Section 9 shall be the exclusive means of resolving disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan and this Agreement. The Company, the Grantee, and the Grantees assignees (the parties) shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan and this Agreement by negotiation between individuals who have authority to settle the controversy. Negotiations shall be commenced by either party by notice of a written statement of the partys position and the name and title of the individual who will represent the party. Within thirty (30) days of the written notification, the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to resolve the dispute. If the dispute has not been resolved by negotiation, the parties agree that any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan or this Agreement shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (or should such court lack jurisdiction to hear such action, suit or proceeding, in a California state court in the County of San Mateo) and that the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of such court. The parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection the party may have to the laying of venue for any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court. THE PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE OR MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. If any one or more provisions of this Section 9 shall for any reason be held invalid or unenforceable, it is the specific intent of the parties that such provisions shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it or its application valid and enforceable.

. Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, upon deposit for delivery by an internationally recognized express mail courier service or upon deposit in the United States mail by certified mail (if the parties are within the United States), with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at its address as shown in these instruments, or to such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other party.
 
11.
  
No Effect on Terms of Service
. Nothing in the Notice, the Agreement, or the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee any right with respect to future deferred stock unit grants or continuation of Grantees Continuous Active Service, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Grantees right or the right of the Grantees employer to terminate Grantees Continuous Active Service, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Unless the Grantee has a written employment agreement with the Company to the contrary, Grantees status is at will.
This Award shall not, under any circumstances, be considered or taken into account for purposes of calculation of severance payments in those jurisdictions requiring such payments upon termination of employment
.
The Grantee shall not have and waives any and all rights to compensation or damages as a result of the termination of the Grantees employment with the Company or the Grantees employer for any reason whatsoever, insofar as those rights result or may result from (i) the loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements or claimed rights or entitlements under the Plan, or (ii) the Grantees ceasing to be entitled to any purchase rights or shares or any other rights under the Plan.
 
12.

In the event of my death prior to the settlement of my currently outstanding or subsequently issued Deferred Stock units (the 
Units
) under any existing or subsequently adopted equity incentive plan of JDS Uniphase Corporation or its successor in interest (the 
Company
) (whether adopted by the Company or assumed by the Company in connection with a merger, acquisition or other similar transaction) or issued to me by the Company outside of any such equity plan, and in lieu of disposing of my interest,
1
 
if any, in the Units at the time of my death by my will or the laws of intestate succession, I hereby designate the following persons as Primary Beneficiary(ies) and Contingent Beneficiary(ies) of my interest in the Units:

A married grantee whose Units are community property may dispose only of his or her own interest in the Units. In such cases, the grantees spouse may (a) consent to the grantees designation by signing the Spousal Consent or (b) designate the grantee or any other person(s) as the beneficiary(ies) of his or her interest in the Units on a separate Beneficiary Designation.
Should all the individual Primary Beneficiary(ies) fail to survive me or if the trust named as the Primary Beneficiary does not exist at my death (or no will of mine containing a residuary trust is admitted to probate within six months of my death), the Contingent Beneficiary(ies) shall be entitled to my interest in the Units for the shares indicated. Should any individual beneficiary fail to survive me or a charity named as a beneficiary no longer exist at my death, such beneficiarys share shall be divided among the remaining named Primary or Contingent Beneficiaries, as appropriate, in proportion to the percentage shares I have allocated to them. In the event that no Individual Primary Beneficiary(ies) or Contingent Beneficiary(ies) survives me, no trust (excluding a residuary testamentary trust) or charity named as a Primary Beneficiary or Contingent Beneficiary exists at my death, and no will of mine containing a residuary trust is admitted to probate within six months of my death, then my interest in the Units shall be disposed of by my will or the laws of intestate succession, as applicable.
 
This Beneficiary Designation is effective until I file another such designation with JDS Uniphase Corporation. Any previous Beneficiary Designations are hereby revoked.
 
 
Spousal Consent for Units that are Community Property (necessary if separate beneficiary designation is not filed by Spouse):
 
I hereby consent to this Beneficiary Designation and agree that this designation of beneficiaries provided herein shall apply to my community property interest in the Units. This consent does not apply to any subsequent Beneficiary Designation which may be filed by my spouse. This consent may be revoked by me at any time, whether by filing a Beneficiary Designation disposing of my interest in the Units or by filing a written notice of revocation with the Company.
