Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
(e)    On November 16, 2007, the stockholders of JDS Uniphase Corporation (the Company) amended its 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 1998 Plan) by approving the Amended and Restated 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the Amended 1998 Plan). The Companys 1998 Plan was originally approved by the Companys stockholders in June 1998.
 
The 1998 Plan is intended to provide eligible employees of the Company with the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company through participation in a stock purchase plan. Each participant in the 1998 Plan is granted at the beginning of each purchase period the right to purchase through accumulated payroll deductions up to a number of shares of the common stock of the Company (referred to as a "Purchase Right") determined on the first day of the purchase period. The Purchase Right is automatically exercised on the last date of the purchase period provided the Purchase Right remains outstanding on such date.
 
 
The amendment
changes the termination date of the 1998 Plan, which was originally established as either the earlier of (i) August 1, 2008 or (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the 1998 Plan are sold in accordance with the 1998 Plan. As of November 16, 2007, the new termination date for the Amended 1998 Plan is the earlier of (i) August 1, 2018 or (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Amended 1998 Plan are sold in accordance with the Amended 1998 Plan.
 
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 15, 2007, t
he Bylaws of the Company were amended and restated (the Amended and Restated Bylaws) to permit the Company to issue uncertificated shares. Previously, the Bylaws required that all shares of capital stock of the Company be represented by certificates. The Bylaws were amended in order for the Company to become eligible to participate in a Direct Registration Program as required by NASDAQ Rules 4350(1).
A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws incorporating this change is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.5 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such Bylaws and provided that the Board of Directors shall not make or alter any Bylaws fixing the qualifications, classifications, or term of office of directors.
