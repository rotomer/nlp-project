With reference to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of JDS Uniphase Corporation (the "Company") to be held on November 12, 2008, and to Proposal 2 relating to amendments to the Company's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has resolved that the proposed amendment to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan be reduced from 13,200,000 to 12,000,000 shares, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of a stock split or other change in the Common Stock or capital structure of the Company. As revised, the proposed amendment would cause the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan to be increased from 30,000,000 to 42,000,000.
