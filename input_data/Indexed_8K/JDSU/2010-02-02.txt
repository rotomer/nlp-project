Milpitas, California, February 2, 2010 
Net revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $342.9 million and the net loss was $(19.5) million, or $(0.09) per share. This compares to net revenue of $297.8 million and a net loss of $(31.9) million or $(0.15) per share for the prior quarter, and net revenue of $353.8 million and a net loss of $(722.9) million or $(3.36) per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2009.
On a non-GAAP basis, net revenue for the second quarter was $343.8 million and net income for the quarter was $26.6 million or $0.12 per share. This compares to non-GAAP net revenue of $298.6 million and net income of $9.0 million or $0.04 per share for the prior quarter, and non-GAAP net revenue of $354.0 million and net income of $25.6 million or $0.12 per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2009.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains, and the discussions in our subsequent conference call will contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include: (i) any anticipation or guidance as to future financial performance, including future revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating margin, EBITDA, cash flow and other financial metrics; and (ii) the Company's beliefs regarding the purpose, usefulness and efficacy of non-GAAP results and the measures and items the Company includes in the same, as well as any benefits to investors the Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, the Company's ability to predict future financial performance continues to be difficult due to, among other things: (a) continuing general limited visibility across many of our product lines exacerbated by the current credit and financial market uncertainty, as well as the migration to vendor managed inventory programs; (b) quarter-over-quarter product mix fluctuations, which can materially impact profitability measures due to the broad gross margin range across our portfolio; (c) consolidation of our customer base, which, in the shorter term limits demand visibility, and, in the longer term, could reduce our business potential; (d) average selling prices continue to decline across our businesses; (e) our Communications Test and Measurement business is notable for seasonality and a significant level of in-quarter book-and-ship business, further limiting our forecasting abilities; (f) we are currently engaged in various product and manufacturing transfers, site consolidations and product discontinuances, which has caused and may cause short term disruptions; and (g) the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet additional production and delivery requirements beyond our forecasted demand.
For more information on these and other risks affecting the Company's business, please refer to the "Risk Factors" section included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2009 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Use of Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures
The Company provides non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA financial measures as supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. The Company evaluates Company-wide segment performance using, among other things, the measures disclosed in this release for the purposes of evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as its performance relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses these items to further its own understanding of the Company's core operating performance. The Company believes its "core operating performance" represents the Company's performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from "core operating performance" those items, such as those relating to restructuring, investing, stock-based compensation expense and non-cash activities that management does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities.
The Company believes that providing this information to its investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows investors to see Company results "through the eyes" of management. The Company further believes that providing this information allows Company investors to both better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
The non-GAAP adjustments described in this release have historically been excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below.
Restructuring and Related Activities
Cost of goods sold, costs of research and development and costs of selling, general and administrative related to restructuring events: The Company has incurred periodic expenses, included in its GAAP presentation of gross margin and operating expenses that may include (i) additional depreciation from changes in estimated useful life and the write-down of certain property and equipment that has been identified for disposal but remained in use until the date of disposal, (ii) workforce related charges such as retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to a formal restructuring plan, (iii) building costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain equipment from these facilities and/or contract manufacturer facilities. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that the impact of these items does not reflect expected future gross profits or operating expenses nor does the Company believe that they provide a meaningful evaluation of current versus past core operational performance.
Investment Activities
Gain or loss on sale of available for-sale investments and impairment of investments: The Company has sold investments or adjusted the value of investments from time to time based on market conditions. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business does not include making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets.
JDSU News Release
 
Moreover, the amount and timing of gains and losses and adjustments to the value of investments are unpredictable. Consequently, the Company believes that gains or losses on these sales and adjustments to the value of investments are not related to the ongoing core business and operating performance of the Company. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of the Company's core operating performance.
Gain or loss on equity method investments: The Company records gains or losses on its equity investments based on our pro-rata share of gains or the net losses of the investment. The Company's activities in this respect are included in the Company's GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business is not making financial investments in third parties, and such investments do not constitute a material portion of the Company's assets. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of gains or losses are unpredictable, as they are inherently based on the performance of the third party subject of a particular investment. The Company excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes the GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
Stock-based compensation expense: Non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share excludes stock-based compensation expense under authoritative guidance. The Company excludes this item, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes this GAAP measure is not indicative of its core operating performance.
Non-Cash Activities
Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions: The Company incurs amortization of intangibles, included in its GAAP presentation of cost of goods sold and operating expense, related to the various acquisitions it has made. Management excludes these items, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that eliminating this expense from operating income is useful to investors because it believes the GAAP measure, alone, is not indicative of its core cost of goods sold and operating expenses and performance.
Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets: The Company incurs costs, included in its GAAP presentation of operating expense, related to the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance. These adjustments typically occur when the financial performance of the business utilizing the affected assets falls below certain thresholds or certain assets are designated as held for sale. Accordingly, the related asset value impairments are non-recurring and generally unpredictable. The Company believes that eliminating this item, for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA, is useful to investors. We believe this non-GAAP adjustment will assist investors to compare current versus past performance. The Company's historical adjustments to the carrying value of certain of its assets under authoritative guidance, as well as the methodology used by the Company in assessing the same, are more particularly described in its quarterly reports on form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.
JDSU News Release
 
Interest, taxes, and depreciation expense: The Company incurs depreciation expense in its operating results. The Company's calculation of adjusted EBITDA excludes items as a result of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes adjusted EBITDA is indicative of the Company's core operational cash flow.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) is net income (loss). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is income (loss) from operations. The Company believes that these GAAP measures alone are not indicative of its core operating expenses and performance.
