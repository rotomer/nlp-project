On February 10, 2010, JDS Uniphase Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("JDSU"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Agilent"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, JDSU will acquire substantially all of the assets of Agilent and its affiliates that relate to the design, development, research, manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, support and maintenance of the Agilent Network Protocol Test Products, Agilent Wireless Drive Test Systems and Agilent Network Service Assurance and Test Systems (excluding the Agilent N2X and Agilent Network Tester products) and the provision of services relating to such products (the "Business"), and assume certain liabilities of Agilent relating to the Business, for a cash purchase price of $165 million, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
The acquisition is scheduled to close, subject to certain customary closing conditions, upon the receipt of customary government approvals related to anti-trust and competition laws. If the closing has not occurred by August 2, 2010, which may be extended to September 2, 2010, either party may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement without penalty.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, JDSU will offer employment to all employees of the Business. JDSU and Agilent have also entered into a Transition Services Agreement under which Agilent will provide to JDSU, for agreed upon fees and beginning on the date of the closing, certain services through June 30, 2010 and certain other services through August 31, 2010 (subject to earlier termination by JDSU under certain circumstances).
The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. Each party has agreed to indemnify the other for (i) subject to certain limitations, losses arising out of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Asset Purchase Agreement and in certain related documents and (ii) liabilities that, in the case of JDSU, are excluded from the transaction and, in the case of Agilent, are assumed by JDSU.
The foregoing description of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Asset Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K.
On February 11, 2010, JDSU issued a press release, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(ii) dispute the Adjustment Calculation by delivering to Seller a written notice (a "") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed in good faith.
Dispute Notice
For purposes of this Section 3.3(c), Purchaser (A) may only deliver a Dispute Notice on the basis that Seller's calculation of the Final Working Capital was not calculated in accordance with Section 3.3(a), or that the Adjustment Calculation contains mathematical errors on its face and (B) may not dispute any individual item relating to Seller's calculation of the Final Working Capital having a value of less than $50,000 unless the value of such item can be determined with reasonable certainty (e.g., accounts receivable and accounts payable).
(d) If Purchaser fails to take either of the foregoing actions described in Section 3.3(c) within 45 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then Purchaser will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Adjustment Calculation, in which case, the Adjustment Calculation will be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of Section 3.3(g).
(e) If Purchaser timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Seller, then Purchaser and Seller will attempt in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to agree on the Adjustment Calculation for purposes of Section 3.3(g).

Purchaser and Seller will instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report that specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting Firm as to each item in dispute and the resulting Adjustment Calculation. Purchaser and Seller will each use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination within 30 days after referral of the items to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination of the Adjustment Calculation as set forth in its report will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 3.3(g). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be shared by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for the account of Purchaser and Seller, respectively.

Independent Accounting Firm
(f) For purposes of complying with this Section 3.3, Purchaser and Seller will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed items as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and are available to that Party (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Accounting Firm, provided that such materials will be provided to the other Party, and such other Party shall be provided with an opportunity to participate in any such discussions.

(a) The Parties intend that there shall be continuity of employment with respect to all Business Employees as follows:
(i) Automatic Transferred Employees shall not be terminated upon Closing, but rather the rights, powers, duties, liabilities and obligations of Seller (or the relevant Subsidiary of Seller) to such employees in respect of the material terms of employment with the employees in force immediately before Closing (other than eligibility to participate in, coverage or benefits under any equity or pension plan to the extent permitted by local employment Laws) shall be transferred to Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary, but only to the extent required by, and only then in accordance with, local employment Laws. So long as Purchaser complies with this Section 6.6(a)(i), if an Automatic Transferred Employee objects to the transfer of employment to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, any and all Liabilities arising in connection with such termination, notice, severance and similar payments shall constitute an Excluded Liability for the purpose of Section 9.1(a)(iv).
(ii) For Non-Automatic Transferred Employees, Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary shall offer employment to each such employee effective on the Closing Date, or as otherwise agreed between Seller and Purchaser, each such offer to be at the employee's same general location and same base salary as is in effect immediately prior to the Closing and otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions of employment (including cash and equity incentive opportunities) in the aggregate as are provided by Purchaser to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries. For the sake of clarity, if a Non-Automatic Transferred Employee rejects the offer of employment with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, any and all Liabilities arising in connection with such termination, notice, severance and similar payments shall constitute an Excluded Liability for the purpose of Section 9.1(a)(iv).
(iii) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to take any action they are legally required to take in order to comply with local employment Laws.
(iv) Those employees who are transferred to Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries in accordance with clause (i) above and those who accept the offer of employment from Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries in accordance with clause (ii) above and, in each case, who commence employment with Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." For purposes hereof, "commence employment" shall mean the date that such employees become employed by Purchaser.
(v) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to (and shall not encourage or assist its Affiliates to), engage in any activity intended to discourage any Business Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries. Modification of the terms of employment (or the offer of employment) as described in Section 6.6(a)(i), (ii) and (vi) shall not be regarded as a discouragement of employment. Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to (and shall not encourage or assist its Affiliates to), offer employment with any business of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Business) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date (other than Business Employees who have applied for a position with Seller or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates outside the Business prior to the date hereof and who are listed in of the Disclosure Letter to the extent permitted by local Law); , , that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to take any action they are legally required to take in order to comply with local employment Laws.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.6 or with respect to any payments under a Seller Plan, any and all Liabilities to provide any severance or similar payments to any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (other than Restructuring Liabilities) shall constitute Assumed Liabilities for the purposes of Section 9.1(b)(iv).
(b) Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Transferred Employees or their covered dependents on or prior to the Closing Date. Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Transferred Employees or their covered dependents after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred: in the case of medical or dental benefits, when the services that are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case of long-term disability benefits, when the disability occurs; in the case of workers compensation benefits, when the event giving rise to the benefits occurs; and otherwise, at the time the Transferred Employee or covered dependent becomes entitled to payment of a benefit (assuming that all procedural requirements are satisfied and claims applications properly and timely completed and submitted).
(c) With respect to any plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), or any plan that would be a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) if it were subject to ERISA, maintained by Purchaser, Purchaser shall recognize all service of Transferred Employees with Seller and its Subsidiaries for purposes of any pre-existing condition and waiting periods.
(d) Transferred Employees shall be given credit for all service with Seller and any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Seller, under each Purchaser Plan in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate for all purposes.
(e) Except as required by applicable Law or as may be agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, as of the Closing Date the Transferred Employees shall cease to accrue further benefits under Seller Plans and shall commence participation as soon as practicable under the terms of Purchaser Plans. Seller shall take all necessary actions to fully vest the Transferred Employees in their account balances under the Seller 401(k) plan and Seller Retirement Plan. Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to permit each such Transferred Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Seller 401(k) plan and the Seller Retirement Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution, including any associated loans, as part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by the Seller 401(k) plan and the Seller Retirement Plan into an account under a 401(k) plan maintained by Purchaser (the ""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree following the date hereof, but prior to the Closing Date, to provide for a trust to trust transfer of the account balances of Transferred Employees under the Seller's 401(k) plan to Purchaser's 401(k) Plan.

(g) Any and all Liabilities arising under COBRA or similar applicable Laws in the United States arising from the actions (or inactions) of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date shall constitute Assumed Liabilities for the purposes of Section 9.1(b)(iv). Seller shall retain all such Liabilities, including all Liabilities with respect to any "qualifying event" (as defined under COBRA), incurred on or prior to the Closing Date or arising as a result of the transactions described herein, which shall constitute Excluded Liabilities for the purposes of Section 9.1(a)(iv).

Acquisition Targets Emerging LTE/4G Wireless Market
JDSU today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Network Solutions communications test business of Agilent, including the unit's innovative Long Term Evolution (LTE), or 4G, network verification and deployment products, for $165 million in cash. The parties expect to close the transaction, which is subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals, in the June calendar quarter 2010.
Milpitas, Calif., February 11, 2010
The Agilent unit being acquired by JDSU had annual revenue for its fiscal year ending October 31, 2009 of $162 million from global sales of service assurance monitoring systems, drive test and protocol test instruments used by leading service providers and equipment manufacturers worldwide. JDSU expects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share on a quarterly basis and for the full fiscal year starting in fiscal 2011.
The acquisition significantly expands JDSU's communications test position, including the emerging market for LTE/4G solutions required by the dozens of wireless service providers and network equipment manufacturers upgrading to this next-generation technology. LTE will provide much higher bandwidth to support mobile data and video applications on handsets, notebooks, portable readers and gaming devices. More than 50 wireless service providers worldwide have announced plans to deploy LTE, including such companies as AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, China Mobile, T-Mobile Germany, NTT DoCoMo and Verizon Wireless. Test products are used throughout the LTE development, deployment and operational life-cycle.
"This acquisition establishes JDSU as a market leader in wireless test instruments and systems and enables us to provide customers with new innovative LTE solutions as they deploy this next-generation mobile data technology," said Tom Waechter, president and chief executive officer of JDSU. "JDSU gains market-leading technology and a talented employee team that will fit well with JDSU's customer-centric culture."
The Agilent unit being acquired by JDSU has approximately 700 employees with business operations located in Colorado, the U.K., Singapore and Beijing.
With the acquisition, JDSU will broaden its wireless service assurance and instruments business with the addition of the following customer offerings:
