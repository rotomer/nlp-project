This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by JDS Uniphase Corporation (the "Company") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2011 ("Original Filing"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Company's decision as to how frequently it will conduct future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers. No other changes have been made to the Original Filing.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") held on November 16, 2011, a majority of the Company's stockholders voted to recommend, on a non-binding advisory basis, that the Company's advisory vote to approve the compensation of its named executive officers (the "Say on Pay Vote") be conducted annually.
Based on these results, which were consistent with the Company's recommendation, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has determined that the Company will conduct the Say on Pay Vote annually, until the next stockholder vote on the frequency of the Say on Pay Vote, which is required to occur no later than the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
