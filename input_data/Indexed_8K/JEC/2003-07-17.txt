EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
PASADENA, CALIF.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE: JEC) today announced net earnings of $32.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 ended June 30, 2003. This compares to net earnings of $27.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2003, Jacobs reported net earnings of $94.5 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.6 billion. This compares to net earnings for the same period last year of $80.7 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.3 billion.
 
Commenting on the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2003, Jacobs CEO Noel G. Watson stated, "I am very pleased with the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Our earnings per share reflects a 16% increase from the third quarter of 2002. Our sales efforts during the quarter were very successful and our prospects remain strong. We continue to execute our projects well, and we look forward to the balance of fiscal 2003."
 
Jacobs also announced backlog at June 30, 2003 totaling $6.5 billion, including a technical professional services component of $3.3 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $6.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2002. Backlog at June 30, 2003 does not include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers environmental remediation program for its New England District, valued at $240 million. Although the Company received notification of this award, it was subsequently notified that the award is being protested and, accordingly, deferred adding the contract to backlog until the protest has been resolved. Backlog at June 30, 2003 also reflects the removal of approximately $110 million of revenues relating to procurement activity, that will now be performed by clients.
