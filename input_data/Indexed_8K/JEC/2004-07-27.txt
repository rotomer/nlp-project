PASADENA, CALIF. - Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced net earnings of $29.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 ended June 30, 2004. This compares to net earnings of $32.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
For the nine months ended June 30, 2004, Jacobs reported net earnings of $98.5 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.4 billion. This compares to net earnings of $94.5 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.6 billion for the nine months ended June 30, 2003.
 
Jacobs also announced backlog at June 30, 2004 totaling $7.0 billion, including a technical professional services component of $3.6 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $6.5 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2003. During the quarter, Jacobs removed approximately $310.0 million from backlog, including $150.0 million relating to procurement activity on a large oil and gas project where the client decided to perform the procurement directly.
 
Commenting on the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Chief Executive Officer Noel G. Watson stated, "We are obviously disappointed with this quarter's results. As we stated in our press release on June 28, we had several projects where our work was suspended or delayed, and one project that was cancelled entirely. In spite of these events, our business prospects remain strong. We had a solid sales quarter, and our backlog at quarter-end totals $7.0 billion, in spite of the backlog adjustments made."
 
In commenting on the earnings outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2004, Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Our guidance for fiscal 2004 is between $2.22 and $2.28 per share. Our preliminary guidance for fiscal year 2005 reflects achieving earnings in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share."
