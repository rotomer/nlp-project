For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Jacobs reported net earnings of $42.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.5 billion. This compares to net earnings of $30.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Commenting on the results for the year, Jacobs Chairman and CEO Noel G. Watson stated, "Fiscal 2005 was a good year for Jacobs. We posted a 14 percent increase in earnings-per-share and grew backlog by 16 percent. Many of our clients' markets are showing increased capital spending activity, including oil & gas, federal programs, and civil & infrastructure. Our prospects remain strong, and I expect fiscal 2006 to be another good growth year for us. I want to thank our management and employees for all of their efforts last year, and I want to thank our customers and shareholders for their continued support."

Our outlook for fiscal 2006 remains positive and we expect earnings for the year to be in line with our EPS growth rate goal of 15 percent, before the effects of adopting FAS 123(R)."
