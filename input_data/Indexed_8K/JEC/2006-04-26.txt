Non-GAAP Financial Measure:
Management of the Company believes that earnings before the effects of SFAS 123R is useful information, particularly during this first year of adoption, because it allows investors to assess for themselves the Company's earnings trend. Such non-GAAP information is also integral to Management's internal evaluation of the Company's performance. The following table reconciles the Company's reported GAAP net earnings and earnings per share to the non-GAAP financial measure (in thousands, except earnings per share):
