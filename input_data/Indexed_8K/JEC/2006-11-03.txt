PASADENA, CALIF.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006.
Fiscal 2006 and Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today record net earnings of $196.9 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, on revenues of $7.4 billion for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. This compares to net earnings of $131.6 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, on revenues of $5.6 billion for fiscal 2005.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Jacobs reported net earnings of $58.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.0 billion. This compares to net earnings of $38.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 include a net, after-tax benefit of $3.1 million, or $0.05 per share, representing the favorable settlement of a matter with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), off-set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures. The effects of the settlement and other income tax exposures on the elements of the income statement include an increase in pre-tax interest income of $3.3 million, and a $1.5 million net reduction in the Company's income tax provision.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $9.8 billion at September 30, 2006, including a technical professional services component of $5.2 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $8.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2005.
Commenting on the results for year, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "Clearly we had a strong quarter, capping a good year. Earnings, sales, and backlog are at record levels. Our customers are continuing to invest, so we expect to see growth continuing throughout FY 2007."
Also commenting on the results for the year and on the Company's earnings outlook for fiscal 2007, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "The outlook for 2007 should continue to track above our target 15% average growth with earnings per share between $3.75 and $4.05."
Effective as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, the Company adopted FASB Statement 123R using the modified retrospective application method. Accordingly, its results of operations for prior fiscal periods have been adjusted to include compensation cost relating to stock options.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure:
Management of the Company believes that earnings before the effects of SFAS 123R is useful information, particularly during this first year of adoption, because it allows investors to assess for themselves the Company's earnings trend. Such non-GAAP information is also integral to Management's internal evaluation of the Company's performance. The following table reconciles the Company's reported GAAP net earnings and earnings per share to the non-GAAP financial measure (in thousands, except earnings per share):
