SECTION 2.02 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Board, by a committee of the Board that has been duly designated by the Board and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the Board or in these Bylaws, include the power to call such meetings or by the Chairman of the Board. Unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

SECTION 2.03 PLACE OF MEETINGS. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to time be designated by the person or persons calling the respective meeting and specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.
SECTION 2.04 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to any other action.
If the Board does not so fix a record date, then: (i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the day on which the first written consent is expressed; (iii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 2.05 NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Except as otherwise required by law, notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting by delivering a typewritten or printed notice thereof to the stockholder personally, or by depositing such notice in the United States mail, in a postage prepaid envelope, directed to the stockholder at the address furnished by the stockholder to the Secretary of the Corporation for such purpose or, if the stockholder shall not have furnished to the Secretary of the Corporation an address for such purpose, then at the address of the stockholder last known to the Secretary, or by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
Notice given as provided above shall be deemed given to the stockholder as follows: (i) if by personal delivery, when delivered to the stockholder; (ii) if by mail, when deposited in the United States mail; (iii) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iv) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (v) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (a) such posting and (b) the giving of such separate notice; and (vi) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
Except as otherwise expressly required by law, no publication of any notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall be required. Every notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to
 
any stockholder who shall have waived such notice and such notice shall be deemed waived by any stockholders who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy, except as for stockholders who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Except as otherwise expressly required by law, notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
SECTION 2.06 ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.06 shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of Directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.06. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposed to nominate for election or re-election a Director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person and (iv) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including without limitation such persons' written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by such stockholder. At the request of the Board any person nominated by the Board for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.06. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
SECTION 2.07 QUORUM. Except in the case of any meeting for the election of directors summarily ordered as provided by law, the holders of record of a majority in voting interest of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to be voted thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation or any adjournment thereof. In the absence of a quorum at any meeting or any adjournment thereof, a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat or, in the absence therefrom of all the stockholders, any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting may adjourn such meeting from time to time. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

The Secretary of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
 
the duration thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
SECTION 2.10 JUDGES. If at any meeting of the stockholders a vote by written ballot shall be taken on any question, the chairman of such meeting may appoint a judge or judges to act with respect to such vote. Each judge so appointed shall first subscribe an oath faithfully to execute the duties of a judge at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. Such judges shall decide upon the qualification of the voters and shall report the number of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on such question, shall conduct and accept the votes, and, when the voting is completed, shall ascertain and report the number of shares voted respectively for and against the question. Reports of judges shall be in writing and subscribed and delivered by them to the Secretary of the Corporation. The judges need not be stockholders of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation may be a judge on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in which he shall have a material interest.

SECTION 3.14 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. There may be an Executive Committee of three or more
 
directors appointed by the Board, who may meet at stated times, or on notice to all members of such Committee by any of their own number, during the intervals between the meetings of the Board; they shall advise and aid the officers of the Corporation in all matters concerning its interests and the management of its business, and generally perform such duties and exercise such powers as may be directed or delegated by the Board from time to time.

Said Committee shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. It shall act only during such emergency condition and so long as the number of Directors able to act shall have been reduced to fewer than five, and until a Board of Directors has been elected by the stockholders. Such Committee shall meet as promptly as possible after the commencement of such an emergency condition as would activate the Committee and at such subsequent time or times as it may designate until a Board of Directors has been duly elected. Such Committee shall as the first order of business elect an Emergency Executive Committee from among its members and a chairman thereof, who shall be the chief executive officer of the Corporation. Such Executive Committee shall function in the same manner and possess the same powers as the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, as provided in Article III of these Bylaws, and shall have as many members as shall be provided by resolution of the Board. Such Committees shall make their own rules of procedure except to the extent otherwise provided by resolution of the Board. A majority of the members of the Committees able to act shall constitute a quorum. The physical presence of a member shall not be required if his vote on an action to be taken can be obtained by available means of communication. Any vacancy occurring in said Committees caused by resignation, death or other incapacity may be filled by a majority of the remaining members of the Emergency Management Committee and any member so chosen shall serve until a Board of Directors has been duly elected.

The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more other committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. To the full extent permitted by law, any such committee shall have and may exercise such powers and authority as the Board may designate in such resolution. Vacancies in the membership of a committee shall be filled by the Board at a regular meeting or a special meeting for that purpose. Any such committee shall keep written minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board when required.

For the purpose of deposit and for the purpose of collection for the account of the Corporation, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Executive, Group, Senior or other Vice President or the Treasurer (or any other officer or officers, assistant or assistants, agent or agents, or attorney or attorneys of the Corporation who shall from time to time be determined by the Board) may endorse, assign and deliver checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of money which are payable to the order of the Corporation.
SECTION 5.03 GENERAL AND SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS. The Board may from time to time authorize the opening and keeping of general and special bank accounts with such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board may select or as may be selected by any officer or officers, assistant or assistants, agent or agents, or attorney or attorneys of the Corporation to whom such power shall have been delegated by the Board. The Board may make such special rules and regulations with respect to such bank accounts, not inconsistent with the provisions of these Bylaws, as it may deem expedient.
 
SECTION 6.01 CERTIFICATES FOR STOCK. Every owner of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate or certificates, to be in such form as the Board shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of the stock of the Corporation owned by him. The certificates representing shares of such stock shall be numbered in the order in which they shall be issued and shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman, Vice Chairman or Chief Executive Officer or President or an Executive, Group, Senior or other Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer. Any of or all of the signatures on the certificates may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon, any such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as though the person who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon, any such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as though the person who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature shall have been placed thereupon, were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. A record shall be kept of the respective names of the persons, firms or corporations owning the stock represented by such certificates, the number and class of shares represented by such certificates, respectively, and the respective dates thereof, and in case of cancellation, the respective dates of cancellation. Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in Section 6.04.
SECTION 6.02 TRANSFERS OF STOCK. Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be registered on the books of the Corporation or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 6.03, only upon surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed by the registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed, and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purpose as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates shall be presented to the Corporation for registration of transfer, both the transferor and the transferee request the Corporation to do so.
SECTION 6.03 REGULATIONS. The Board may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these Bylaws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of the stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates for stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.
SECTION 6.04 LOST, STOLEN, DESTROYED, AND MUTILATED CERTIFICATES. In any case of loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place upon proof of such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation and upon the giving of a bond of indemnity to the Corporation in such form and in such sums as the Board may direct; provided, however, that a new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board, it is proper so to do.
SECTION 6.05 FIXING DATE FOR DETERMINATION OF STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting
 
of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than twenty (20) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If in any case involving the determination of stockholders for any purpose other than notice of or voting at a meeting of stockholders the Board shall not fix such a record date, the record date for determining stockholders for such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 7.01 ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or as a member of any committee or similar body, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
SECTION 7.02 ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or as a member of any committee or similar body, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
SECTION 7.03 DETERMINATION OF RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION. Any indemnification under Section 7.01 or 7.02 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is
 
proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders.
SECTION 7.04 INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST EXPENSES OF SUCCESSFUL PARTY. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 7.01 or 7.02, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
SECTION 7.05 ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer, to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board deems appropriate.
SECTION 7.06 OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. The benefits provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
SECTION 7.07 INSURANCE. Upon resolution passed by the Board, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or hold him harmless against such liability under the provisions of this Article.
SECTION 7.08 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS. For the purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, and shall also include without limitation Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., a California corporation, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would if he had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
SECTION 7.09 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans, and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation that imposes a duty on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries.
 
SECTION 7.10 BROADEST LAWFUL INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to the foregoing, the Corporation shall, to the broadest and maximum extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists from time to time (but, in case of any amendment to or change in Delaware law, only to the extent that such amendment or change permits the Corporation to provide broader rights of indemnification than is permitted to the Corporation prior to such amendment or change), indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding than is permitted to the Corporation prior to such amendment or change), pay to such person any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending or settling any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer, to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 7.10. The first sentence of this Section 7.10 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not indemnify any such person with respect to any of the following matters: (i) remuneration paid to such person if it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such remuneration was in violation of law; or (ii) any accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by such person of the Corporation's securities within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law; or (iii) actions brought about or contributed to by the dishonesty of such person, if a final judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that acts of active and deliberate dishonesty were committed or attempted by such person with actual dishonest purpose and intent and were material to the adjudication; or (iv) actions based on or attributable to such person having gained any personal profit or advantage to which he was not entitled, in the event that a final judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that such person in fact gained such personal profit or other advantage to which he was not entitled; or (v) any matter in respect of which a final decision by a court with competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification is unlawful; provided, however, that the Corporation shall perform its obligations under the second sentence of this Section 7.10 on behalf of such person until such time as it shall be ultimately determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by the first sentence of this Section 7.10 by virtue of any of the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v).
SECTION 7.11 INDEMNITY FUND. Upon resolution passed by the Board, the Corporation may establish a trust or other designated account, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit), to ensure the payment of any or all of its obligations arising under this Article VII and/or any agreements that may be entered into between the Corporation and its officers and directors from time to time.
SECTION 7.12 SEVERABILITY. If any part of this Article VII shall be found, in any action, suit or proceeding or appeal therefrom or in any other circumstances or as to any particular officer, director, employee or agent to be unenforceable, ineffective or invalid for any reason, the enforceability, effect and validity of the remaining parts or of such parts in other circumstances shall not be affected, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
SECTION 7.13 AMENDMENTS. The foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall be deemed to constitute an agreement between the Corporation and each of the persons entitled to indemnification hereunder, for as long as such provisions remain in effect. Any amendment to the foregoing provisions of this Article VII which limits or otherwise adversely affects the scope of indemnification or rights of any
 
such persons hereunder shall, as to such persons, apply only to claims arising, or causes of action based on actions or events occurring, after such amendment and delivery of notice of such amendment is given to the person or persons so affected. Until notice of such amendment is given to the person or persons whose rights hereunder are adversely affected, such amendment shall have no effect on such rights of such persons hereunder. Any person entitled to indemnification under the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall as to any act or omission occurring prior to the date of receipt of such notice, be entitled to indemnification to the same extent as had such provisions continued as Bylaws of the Corporation without such amendment.
SECTION 8.01 SEAL. The Board shall provide a corporate seal, which shall be in the form of a circle and shall bear the name of the Corporation and words and figures showing that the Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware and the year of incorporation.
SECTION 8.02 WAIVER OF NOTICES. Whenever notice is required to be given by these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, the person entitled to said notice may waive such notice in writing, either before or after the time stated therein, and such waiver shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
SECTION 8.03 FISCAL YEAR. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall begin the first day of October in each year.
SECTION 8.04 AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws and applicable law, these Bylaws or any of them may be amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted (a) by the Board, by vote of a majority of the number of directors then in office or (b) by the vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five (75%) percent of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation in an annual meeting of stockholders, without previous notice, or at any special meeting of stockholders, provided that notice of such proposed amendment, repeal or adoption is given in the notice of special meeting. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, any Bylaws adopted or amended by the stockholders may be amended or repealed by the Board or the stockholders.
SECTION 8.05 VOTING STOCK. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, and each Executive, Group, Senior or other Vice President shall have full power and authority on behalf of the Corporation to attend and to act and vote at any meeting of the stockholders of any corporation in which the Corporation may hold stock and at any such meeting shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and powers that are incident to the ownership of such stock and which as the owner thereof the Corporation may have possessed and exercised if present.
