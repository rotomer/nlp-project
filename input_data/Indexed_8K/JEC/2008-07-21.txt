PASADENA, CALIF.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 ended June 30, 2008.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today record net earnings of $108.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.9 billion for its third quarter of fiscal 2008 ended June 30, 2008. This compares to net earnings of $74.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.1 billion for the same period last year.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2008, Jacobs reported net earnings of $306.4 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, on revenues of $8.1 billion. This compares to net earnings of $203.2 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, on revenues of $6.2 billion for the same period in fiscal 2007.
Included in the Company's results of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2008 is an after-tax gain of $5.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, from the sale of its interest in a company that provides specialized operations and maintenance services. The gain was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $18.3 billion at June 30, 2008, including a technical professional services component of $8.0 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $11.0 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2007. Contributing to the increase in backlog during the quarter was approximately $1.0 billion relating to a significant increase in scope of services for an upstream oil and gas project being performed in North America.
 
Commenting on the results for the third quarter, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "Our business continues to be very good. Our company performed well in the third quarter and our backlog reached a new, record level. Most of our markets remain strong, so the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond is also good."
Also commenting on the results for the third quarter and on the Company's earnings outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2008, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Considering the strong quarter we just completed and the growth in backlog, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2008 to a range of $3.15 to $3.40, inclusive of the one-time gain recognized in the first quarter."
