PASADENA, CALIF.  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended October 2, 2009.
Fiscal 2009 and Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today net earnings of $399.9 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.5 billion for its fiscal year ended October 2, 2009. This compares to net earnings of $420.7 million, or $3.38 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.3 billion for fiscal 2008.
Included in the Company's results of operations for fiscal 2008 is an after-tax gain of $5.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, from the sale, in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, of its interest in a company that provides specialized operations and maintenance services.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Jacobs reported net earnings of $79.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.6 billion. This compares to net earnings of $114.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.2 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $15.2 billion at October 2, 2009, including a technical professional services component of $8.2 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $16.7 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, at September 26, 2008. During the quarter ended October 2, 2009, approximately $320 million was removed from backlog as a result of project cancellations, primarily from one project in the upstream oil and gas market.
Commenting on the results for the year, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "We continue to see our markets driven by a difficult economic environment and low business confidence. Our focus on our relationship-based business model and competitive cost posture remain real strengths in this challenging time."
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for fiscal 2010, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Based on our views of the markets, our initial guidance for 2010 earnings per share is a range of $2.00 to $2.60."

Note:
The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30 (determined on the basis of the number of workdays) and, accordingly, an additional week of activity is added every five to six years, such as in fiscal 2009. In the past, and solely for ease of reference, we titled our financial statements as being "at" or "for the fiscal year ended" September 30. Henceforth, we will title our financial statements using the specific date on which our fiscal years end. There was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements from making this change in presentation.
