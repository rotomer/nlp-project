PASADENA, CALIF  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ended July 2, 2010.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today net earnings of $19.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.5 billion for its third quarter of fiscal 2010 ended July 2, 2010. Excluding the effects of the litigation charge discussed below, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $79.3 million and $0.63, respectively. These results compare to net earnings of $94.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.7 billion for the corresponding period last year.
For the nine months ended July 2, 2010, Jacobs reported net earnings of $169.0 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, on revenues of $7.6 billion. Excluding the effects of the litigation charge and the Houston sublease discussed below, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $235.1 million and $1.87, respectively. These results compare to net earnings of $320.5 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, on revenues of $8.9 billion for the same period in fiscal 2009.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $93.3 million pre-tax charge as a result of the previously-announced, unfavorable court judgment it received relating to a waste incineration project in France for the SIVOM de Mulhousienne ("SIVOM"). The SIVOM project was performed by a consortium of contractors that was led by one of Jacobs' subsidiaries under a contract that was entered into in 1996, prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary by Jacobs. Net of the effects on the Company's incentive bonus plan and income taxes, the judgment
 
resulted in a net, after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $60.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share.
The cash impact of the judgment is estimated to be approximately $61.4 million; however, this amount is subject to change based on the timing of and interest due on any cash payments that the parties will make to each other. The Company intends to appeal the judgment against it.
Also included in the Company's results of operations for the nine months ended July 2, 2010 is an after-tax charge of $5.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, relating to the Company ceasing use of one of its offices located in Houston, Texas, and entering into a sublease for the entire property.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $13.5 billion at July 2, 2010, including a technical professional services component of $7.8 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $15.8 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, at July 3, 2009.
Commenting on the results for the second quarter, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "Absent the disappointing result from our litigation in France, we had a successful quarter. Our project execution was good and our outlook remains guardedly positive going forward."
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2010, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Excluding the impact of the litigation in France in the third quarter and the Houston sublease in the first quarter, the guidance for fiscal year 2010 is being narrowed from the previous range of $2.15 to $2.65 to a revised range of $2.30 to $2.65."
