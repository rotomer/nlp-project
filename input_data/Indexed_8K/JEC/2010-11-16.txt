PASADENA, CALIF  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended October 1, 2010.
Fiscal 2010 and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2010 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today net earnings of $246.0 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.9 billion for its fiscal year ended October 1, 2010. Excluding the effects of the litigation and restructuring charge discussed below, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $312.1 million and $2.48, respectively. These results compare to net earnings of $399.9 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, on revenues of $11.5 billion for fiscal 2009.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, Jacobs reported net earnings of $77.0 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.3 billion. This compares to net earnings of $79.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded an $11.4 million pre-tax charge relating to the Company ceasing use of one of its offices located in Houston, Texas, and entering into a sublease for the entire property. Net of the effects on the Company's incentive bonus plan and income taxes, the restructured lease resulted in a net, after-tax charge to earnings of $5.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $93.3 million pre-tax charge because of an unfavorable court judgment it received relating to a waste incineration project in France for the SIVOM de Mulhousienne ("SIVOM"). The SIVOM project was performed by a
 
consortium of contractors that was led by one of Jacobs' subsidiaries under a contract that was entered into in 1996, prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary by Jacobs. Net of the effects on the Company's incentive bonus plan and income taxes, the judgment resulted in a net, after-tax charge to earnings in fiscal 2010 of $60.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. The Company has filed an appeal of the judgment against it.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $13.2 billion at October 1, 2010, including a technical professional services component of $7.6 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $15.2 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, at October 2, 2009. During the fourth quarter, adjustments were made to a variety of extended term, task order, indefinite quantity, and other contracts where it became apparent that the full capacity of previously recorded backlog would not be realized. These adjustments totaled approximately $390 million, all of which related to technical professional services.
Commenting on the results for the year, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "This quarter was a decent finish to a difficult year. Our team did a good job of controlling costs and executing projects well. In addition, our client survey scores are at record levels. When you set aside our backlog adjustments, we are beginning to see some growth in backlog, particularly in technical professional services. We are looking forward to FY11 with some optimism."
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for fiscal 2011, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Based on our current view of our markets, we are initiating guidance for fiscal 2011 earnings per share within a range of $2.30 to $2.80."
Jacobs is hosting a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 16, 2010, which they are webcasting live on the Internet at www.jacobs.com.
Jacobs is one of the world's largest and most diverse providers of technical, professional, and construction services.
