PASADENA, CALIF  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 ended December 31, 2010.
First Quarter Fiscal 2011 Highlights:
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today net earnings of $65.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.4 billion for its first quarter of fiscal 2011 ended December 31, 2010. This compares to net earnings of $72.4 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended January 1, 2010.
Included in the Company's results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 are after-tax costs of $5.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to due diligence costs incurred in support of its acquisition activities.
Included in the Company's results of operations for the first quarter for fiscal 2010 is an after-tax charge of $5.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, relating to the Company having ceased use of one of its offices located in Houston, Texas, and entering into a sublease for the entire property.
Jacobs also announced today backlog totaling $13.0 billion at December 31, 2010, including a technical professional services component of $7.9 billion. Backlog at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter totaled $13.2 billion, including a technical professional services component of $7.6 billion. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 reflects a reduction of approximately $450 million of field services backlog relating to a project where the client decided to procure the subcontracts, materials, and equipment directly. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $14.9 billion including a technical professional services component of $8.2 billion.
 
Commenting on the results for the first quarter, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "While the earnings for the quarter weren't as strong as we would like, there is much to be positive about in the first quarter. Technical professional services backlog is up quarter over quarter and our prospects are strengthening in a number of markets."
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "Including the net contribution from the previously announced acquisition of a number of Aker Solutions' operations within its Process and Construction business, we are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2011 from a range of $2.30 to $2.80 to a range of $2.40 to $2.85 per share. We expect the acquisition to close in our second quarter."
Jacobs is hosting a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 25, 2011, which they are webcasting live on the Internet at .
