This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2011 (the "Original Filing"). The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose the Company's decision regarding how frequently it will conduct future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.

In light of the voting results concerning the frequency with which shareholders will be provided an advisory vote on executive compensation that were delivered at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company's Board of Directors intends that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on its executive compensation until the next advisory vote on the frequency of such votes, which will be no later than the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2017.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
