For the third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended July 1, 2011, Jacobs reported net earnings of $90.7 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.7 billion.

For the nine months ended July 1, 2011, Jacobs reported net earnings of $236.7 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, on revenues of $7.7 billion.
