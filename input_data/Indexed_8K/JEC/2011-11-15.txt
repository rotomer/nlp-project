PASADENA, CALIF  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today its financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2011 Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Jacobs reported today net earnings of $331.0 million, or $2.60 per diluted share, on revenues of $10.4 billion for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. These results compare to net earnings of $246.0 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, on revenues of $9.9 billion for fiscal 2010. Excluding the effects of the SIVOM litigation discussed below, net earnings and earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 were $306.3 million and $2.44, respectively.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Jacobs reported net earnings of $94.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.7 billion. This compares to net earnings of $77.0 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $93.3 million pre-tax charge to earnings relating to an unfavorable court judgment it received pertaining to a waste incineration project in France for the SIVOM de Mulhousienne ("SIVOM"). Net of the effects on the Company's incentive bonus plan and income taxes, the judgment resulted in a net, after-tax charge to earnings in fiscal 2010 of $60.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share.
Jacobs also announced backlog totaling $14.3 billion at September 30, 2011, including a technical professional services component of $9.1 billion. This compares to total backlog and technical professional services backlog of $13.2 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, at October 1, 2010.
Commenting on the results for the year, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, "Fiscal 2011 was a nice improvement over fiscal 2010. Excluding the effects of the SIVOM matter, earnings grew 8% and EPS grew 7%. More importantly, our prospects for Fiscal 2012 are continuing to improve. While much depends on economic conditions and our sales success, we have a great opportunity to return to our traditional strong double digit growth."
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for fiscal 2012, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, "With a solid backlog and improving prospects as we finish 2011, we are initiating guidance for fiscal 2012 earnings per share within a range of $2.80 to $3.20."
Jacobs is hosting a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 15, 2011, which they are webcasting live on the Internet at .
