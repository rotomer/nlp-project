Commenting on the results for the second quarter, Jacobs President and CEO Craig L. Martin stated, While this quarter's earnings were disappointing, the outlook remains positive. Backlog is up 4.2% sequentially and up 7.8% year-over-year. Our prospects are strong and we anticipate a very good year from a sales perspective.
Commenting on the Company's earnings outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2012, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer John W. Prosser, Jr. stated, Our second quarter results were below expectations. Three factors contributed to the results: first, our SG&A expenses were higher than expected; additionally, several planned turnarounds were deferred until FY13, reducing field services margins; lastly, professional services margins in March were lower than anticipated.  As a result, we are revising our guidance for fiscal year 2012 to a range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share.
