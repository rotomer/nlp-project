Exhibit 99.15 Johnson & Johnson Statement on Arbitration Fees and Expenses Johnson & Johnson announced today that a Chicago arbitrator has ordered the Company's Ortho Biotech subsidiary to reimburse Amgen, Inc. for its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in a license dispute between the two companies. The decision follows an October 2002 ruling denying Amgen the right to terminate Ortho Biotech's license to sell its anti-anemia drug, PROCRIT, in the United States. "We are disappointed by the decision given that the arbitrator denied Amgen's request to terminate Ortho Biotech's license and awarded only a small portion of the monetary damages that Amgen sought," said Jeffrey J. Leebaw, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman. A pretax charge of $85 million has been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002, which reflects an estimate of the amount of Amgen's attorneys' fees and costs. Ortho Biotech's attorneys' fees and costs related to this litigation had previously been expensed. Since the Company has not yet filed fourth quarter results with the SEC, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that the fourth quarter and full year results announced on January 21st be amended to include this charge. Exhibit 99.20 of this 8K filing includes the amended results for 2002.

Exhibit 99.20 Fourth Quarter and Year End 2002 Financial Results Johnson & Johnson Excluding Special Charges 2002 Fourth Quarter EPS Rose 17.9% on Sales Increase of 14.3%; 2002 EPS Rose 16.8% on Sales Increase of 12.3% Johnson & Johnson had record sales for the 2002 fourth quarter of $9.4 billion, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, worldwide sales increased 12.8%. Domestic sales were up 13.2%, while international sales increased 12.1% on an operational basis. Worldwide sales for the year 2002 were $36.3 billion, an increase of 12.3% over 2001. Excluding the impact of currency, worldwide sales increased 12.1%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and $.46, increases of 25.2% and 27.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2001, which included special charges. Excluding the after-tax effect of $105 million in special charges in the fourth quarter of 2001, related to in-process R&D costs associated with the acquisitions of Inverness Medical Technology and TERAMed, Inc., net earnings and diluted earnings per share increased over the fourth quarter of 2001 by 14.4% and 17.9%, respectively. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the year, including special charges, were $6.6 billion and $2.16, increases of 16.4% and 17.4%, respectively, as compared to 2001. Excluding special charges, net earnings for the year were a record $6.8 billion and earnings per share were $2.23, representing increases of 15.0% and 16.8% as compared to 2001. The after-tax special charges of $189 million taken in 2002 include in-process R&D costs associated with the acquisitions of Tibotec-Virco and Obtech Medical AG. The after-tax special charges taken in 2001 include $231 million related to the ALZA merger and Inverness Medical Technology and TERAMed, Inc., acquisitions. "Johnson & Johnson had another strong year in 2002, with continued double-digit growth in sales and earnings," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect the broad-based strength and vitality of our businesses, particularly in medical devices and diagnostics and pharmaceuticals." Mr. Weldon also stated, "As we look to the future, our focus is on delivering on the promise of technology, capitalizing on synergies across our broadly based businesses and on our global presence." Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $17.2 billion for the full year 2002 represented an increase of 15.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and 14.8% operationally. Domestic sales increased 16.4%, while international sales increased 11.1% on an operational basis. Sales growth reflects the strong performance of PROCRIT/EPREX, for the treatment of anemia; REMICADE, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease; RISPERDAL, an antipsychotic medication; DURAGESIC, a transdermal patch for chronic pain; TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic, and ACIPHEX/PARIET, a proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal disorders. During the fourth quarter, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) for an additional indication for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, the second most common hospital acquired infection, and for ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium) for the treatment of H. pylori eradication, the single most common cause of peptic ulcers. The Company also filed several new drug applications with the FDA. These include TOPAMAX (topiramate) for the prevention of migraine headaches in adults as well as for use as monotherapy in epilepsy (it is currently approved as adjunctive treatment), LEVAQUIN for a five-day treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and RISPERDAL (risperidone) as both adjunctive and monotherapy for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Also in the quarter, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire OraPharma, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of unique therapeutics in oral health products. The acquisition will provide entry into the oral health professional marketplace by providing a synergistic line of prevention and treatment products to maintain periodontal health. The transaction is valued at approximately $85 million, net of cash, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2003. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics achieved sales of $12.6 billion in 2002, which represented an increase over the prior year of 12.9% on both a reported and an operational basis. Domestic and international sales increased 13.0% and 12.8%, respectively. Strong sales growth was achieved in each of the major franchises within this segment - Cordis's circulatory disease management products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal products; Ethicon's wound care, surgical sports medicine and women's health products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive surgical products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products, and Vistakon's disposable contact lenses. In the fourth quarter, the FDA's Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel voted unanimously, with conditions, to recommend FDA approval of the CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting stent. This drug-eluting coronary stent is the first of its kind to be recommended for FDA approval. Clinical results of the CYPHER stent indicate a significant reduction of in- stent restenosis and revascularization rates as compared to bare metal stents. Also in the quarter, the FDA's Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel unanimously recommended in favor of FDA approval, with conditions, for the INDEPENDENCE iBOT Mobility System. The iBOT Mobility System is a unique device that offers benefits for individuals with mobility- related disabilities. The device can be used to navigate difficult terrain, climb stairs and ramps, and balance at standing height on two wheels. In December, Ethicon received FDA clearance to market VICRYL Plus Antibacterial Suture, the first and only suture designed with an antibacterial agent. Designed to reduce bacterial colonization on the suture, VICRYL Plus may help reduce the risk of complications associated with surgery. Worldwide Consumer sales were $6.6 billion in 2002, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year on a reported basis and 4.6% operationally. Domestic sales increased 4.5%, while international sales increased 4.6% on an operational basis. Consumer sales achieved strong growth in skin care products (NEUTROGENA, CLEAN & CLEAR and AVEENO) and wound care products, as well as in McNeil Nutritional's SPLENDA sweetener products and VIACTIV calcium chews. Johnson & Johnson, with approximately 108,300 employees, is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical device and diagnostic markets. Johnson & Johnson has 198 operating companies in 54 countries around the world, selling products in more than 175 countries.
