On July 15, 2003, Johnson & Johnson announced its consolidated financial results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2003. A copy of this press release is furnished with this report as an exhibit to Form 8-K. The information contained in this report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 12 under Item 9 of Form 8-K as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Release No. 34-47583. The following non-GAAP disclosures were included in the press release to provide investors with information regarding the underlying business. Sales growth excluding currency is presented, as the Company believes that it is a meaningful measure of comparative performance. Currency fluctuations that are not within the control of management can have significant impact on the comparability of reported sales and could disguise meaningful trends in the business. The Company provided earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings and earnings per share (diluted) excluding in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges as these charges are related to business combination transactions. The Company believes that presenting information that excludes IPR&D related amounts is helpful in evaluating the on-going business operations. The press release dated July 15, 2003 was revised to reflect that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for LEVAQUIN was for use in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis and not chronic acute bacterial prostatitis. Additionally, the currency percentages have been added to all references to sales growth rates in the text of the press release.

Exhibit 99.15 New Brunswick, NJ (July 15, 2003) - Johnson & Johnson announced record sales for the second quarter of $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency of 5.0%, worldwide sales increased 8.9%. Domestic sales were up 9.2%, while international sales increased 21.5%. Excluding the impact of currency of 13.1%, international sales increased 8.4%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.2 billion and $.40, decreases of 26.8% and 25.9%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2002. These amounts include after-tax charges of $900 million taken in the second quarter of 2003 for in-process research and development (IPR&D) costs associated with the acquisitions of Scios Inc. and Link Spine Group, Inc. Excluding these charges, as well as IPR&D charges of $189 million for the second quarter of 2002, net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2003 were $2.1 billion and $.70, increases of 14.5% and 16.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2002. "Despite challenging economic conditions and intense competition, our business has maintained solid operational growth," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our investments in a broad range of innovative opportunities, both internally and outside the Company, have enabled this growth and provide a strong platform for the future." Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $4.9 billion for the second quarter of 2003 represented an increase of 14.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency of 4.6%, Pharmaceutical sales increased 10.1%. Domestic sales increased 11.7%, while international sales increased 21.3%. Excluding the impact of currency of 14.7%, international sales increased 6.6%. Sales growth reflects the strong performance of RISPERDAL, an antipsychotic medication; REMICADE, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease; TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic; ACIPHEX/PARIET, a proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal disorders, and DURAGESIC, a transdermal patch for chronic pain. PROCRIT/EPREX, a product for the treatment of anemia, was negatively impacted by increased competition. During the quarter, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Scios, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company with a product for cardiovascular disease and research projects focused on auto-immune diseases. Scios' product NATRECOR is the first novel agent approved for congestive heart failure (CHF) and has several significant advantages over existing therapies for CHF. The transaction is valued at approximately $2.4 billion, net of cash. The Company also received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) for use in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. Worldwide, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $3.6 billion in the second quarter of 2003, which represented an increase over the prior year of 14.6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency of 6.1%, Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales increased 8.5%. Domestic sales increased 8.3%, while international sales increased 22.6%. Excluding the impact of currency of 13.8%, international sales increased 8.8%. Cordis' circulatory disease management products, DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal products, and Ethicon Endo- Surgery's minimally invasive surgical products achieved strong sales growth. During the quarter, immediately following approval by the FDA, the Company launched its CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent making it the first U.S.-approved combination drug device intended to help reduce restenosis (reblockage) of a treated coronary artery. Restenosis is one of the greatest challenges in long-term patient treatment in interventional cardiology. Also in the quarter, the Company completed its acquisition of Link Spine Group, Inc., a privately owned corporation. The acquisition provides DePuy AcroMed, Inc. with exclusive worldwide rights to the SB CHARITE artificial disc, the principal product of Link Spine Group. Worldwide Consumer sales were $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 10.3% over the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currenty of 3.9%, Consumer sales increased 6.4%. Domestic sales increased 2.6%, while international sales increased 19.7%. Excluding the impact of currency of 8.6%, international sales increased 11.1%. Strong growth in Consumer sales were achieved in the AVEENO skin care line, McNeil Nutritional's SPLENDA sweetener, baby & child care products and wound care products.
