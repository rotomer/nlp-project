In 1994 he became Worldwide Chairman, Consumer Pharmaceuticals & Professional Group. He was Worldwide Chairman of Johnson & Johnson's Medical Devices and Diagnostics Group from 1999 until 2001 when he became Vice Chairman of the Board, a position in which he also had responsibility for the consumer businesses. He was named to the additional position of President in 2002. Mr. Lenehan will leave his Board position effective February 1, but will be engaged in the transition of his management responsibilities until his retirement, June 30, according to Mr. Weldon. ###
