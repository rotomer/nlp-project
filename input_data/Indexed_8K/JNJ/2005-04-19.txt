Exhibit 99.15 Johnson & Johnson Reports 2005 First Quarter EPS Rose 16.9% on Sales Increase of 11.0% New Brunswick, NJ (April 19, 2005) - Johnson & Johnson today announced sales for the first quarter of 2005 of $12.8 billion, an increase of 11.0% over the prior year. The increase was attributable to operational growth of 8.8% and a favorable currency impact of 2.2%. Domestic sales were up 4.9%, while international sales increased 20.1%, reflecting operational growth of 14.7% and a positive currency impact of 5.4%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.9 billion and $.97, increases of 17.4% and 16.9%, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2004. "Our strategic principle of being broadly based continues to serve us well," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "I'm pleased that the strong performance of each of the franchises in our Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and the solid results in our Consumer segment were able to add to the more modest increase from our Pharmaceutical business during the quarter." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $4.8 billion for the first quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 16.0%, with operational growth of 13.4% and a positive impact from currency of 2.6%. Domestic sales increased 7.6%, while international sales increased 25.4% (19.9% from operations and 5.5% from currency). All franchises were contributors to the operational growth, which included DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Vistakon's disposable contact lenses; Ortho- Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products; Ethicon's wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive products, and Cordis' circulatory disease management products. During the quarter, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CLOSURE Medical Corporation, a global leader in biomaterial-based medical devices. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $5.8 billion for the first quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 7.0%, with operational growth of 5.3% and a positive impact from currency of 1.7%. Domestic sales increased 3.8%, while international sales increased 13.8% (8.5% from operations and 5.3% from currency). Sales growth reflects the strong performance of REMICADEr (infliximab), a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis; TOPAMAXr (topiramate), an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches; RISPERDALr (risperidone) and RISPERDALr CONSTAT (risperidone), an antipsychotic medication; LEVAQUINr (levofloxacin), an anti-infective; CONCERTAr (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ACIPHEXr/PARIETT (rabeprazole sodium), a proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal disorders. PROCRITr/EPREXr (Epoetin alfa), a product for the treatment of anemia, was negatively impacted by competition and both the hormonal contraceptive franchise and DURAGESICr (fentanyl transdermal system), a transdermal patch for chronic pain, were negatively impacted by generic competition. In April, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which specializes in the discovery of superior formulations and novel crystalline forms of drug molecules. In addition, the Company submitted a new drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for REMICADEr (infliximab) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $2.3 billion for the first quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 11.4%, with operational growth of 8.9% and a positive impact from currency of 2.5%. Domestic sales increased 3.1%, while international sales increased 20.7% (15.4% from operations and 5.3% from currency). Strong growth in Consumer sales was achieved by McNeil Consumer & Specialty Pharmaceuticals' over-the-counter adult TYLENOLr (acetaminophen) products, McNeil Nutritional's SPLENDAr (sucralose) sweetener and the skin care lines of RoCr and AVEENOr. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 200 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 111,000 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world.
