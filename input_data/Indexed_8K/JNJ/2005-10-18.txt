Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Third Quarter 2005 Financial Results Johnson & Johnson Reports 2005 Third Quarter EPS Rose 11.5% on Sales Increase of 6.6% New Brunswick, NJ (October 18, 2005) - Johnson & Johnson today announced sales for the third quarter of $12.3 billion, an increase of 6.6% over the prior year. The increase represented operational growth of 5.8% and a favorable currency impact of .8%. Domestic sales were up 2.6%, while international sales increased 12.2%, reflecting operational growth of 10.3% and a positive currency impact of 1.9%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.6 billion and $.87, increases of 12.1% and 11.5%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2004. Prior-year third quarter net earnings included after-tax in- process research and development charges of $12 million associated with the acquisition of Scott Lab, Inc. "Our broadly based approach to businesses in support of human health care continues to serve us well," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "The strong performance of our worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics and Consumer segments resulted in solid growth for Johnson & Johnson despite the competitive challenges that our Pharmaceutical business has experienced." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $4.6 billion for the third quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 14.3% with operational growth of 13.7% and a positive impact from currency of .6%. Domestic sales increased 14.1%, while international sales increased 14.5% (13.3% from operations and 1.2% from currency). Cordis' circulatory disease management products were a key contributor to the segment results with the primary driver being the CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent, which reduces restenosis (reblockage) of a treated coronary artery. CYPHER is the worldwide leader in drug-eluting stents having now been used to treat more than 1.5 million patients with coronary artery disease. Also contributing to the strong performance of the segment were the results from DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal products, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products and Vistakon's disposable contact lenses. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $5.5 billion for the third quarter represented a decrease of .5% as compared to the prior year with an operational decline of 1.1% and a positive impact from currency of .6%. Domestic sales decreased 4.5%, while international sales increased 7.8% (6.0% from operations and 1.8% from currency). Sales results for DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system), a transdermal patch for chronic pain; ULTRACET (acetaminophen/tramadol hydrochloride), an analgesic, and SPORANOX (itraconazole), an antifungal, were all negatively impacted by generic competition in the U.S. market. Substantially offsetting the impact of generic competition was the strong performance of RISPERDAL (risperidone), an antipsychotic medication; REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (I.M.I.D.); TOPAMAX (topiramate), an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches, and LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin), an anti-infective. During the quarter, the Company announced that it had received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) 750 mg tablets as a five-day treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis and REMICADE (infliximab) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), making REMICADE the first and only biologic approved for UC, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, the Company submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for REMICADE (infliximab) for the treatment of psoriasis. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $2.2 billion for the third quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 10.2% with operational growth of 8.5% and a positive impact from currency of 1.7%. Domestic sales increased 5.1%, while international sales increased 15.5% (12.1% from operations and 3.4% from currency). Strong growth in Consumer sales was achieved in the skin care lines of NEUTROGENA, AVEENO and CLEAN & CLEAR, as well as with McNeil Nutritional's SPLENDA (sucralose) sweetener. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 200 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 115,000 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world.

(2) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings is $18 million and $12 million respectively, which is in-process research & development charges. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger-related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
