Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports 2006 First-Quarter EPS Rose 17.0% on Sales Increase of 1.2% New Brunswick, NJ (April 18, 2006) - Johnson & Johnson today announced sales for the first quarter of $13.0 billion, an increase of 1.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2005. Operational growth was 3.5% with a negative currency impact of 2.3%. Domestic sales were up 1.6%, while international sales increased .8%, reflecting operational growth of 6.1% and a negative currency impact of 5.3%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2006 were $3.3 billion and $1.10. The first quarter included an after-tax gain of $368 million associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement. The first quarter also included after-tax in- process research and development charges of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Hand Innovations LLC and Future Medical Systems S.A. Excluding the impact of these items, net earnings for the quarter were $3.0 billion and diluted earnings per share were $.99, representing increases of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2005.* "Our first quarter results were as anticipated and we look forward to improving performance throughout the balance of the year," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are continuing to make significant investments in research and development in order to bring important new products to market, positioning us well for long- term growth." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $5.0 billion for the first quarter represented a 4.5% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 7.9% and a negative impact from currency of 3.4%. Domestic sales increased 6.7%, while international sales increased 9.0% from operations, partially offset by negative currency of 6.7% for reported growth of 2.3%. Cordis' circulatory disease management products were a key contributor to the segment results with the primary driver being the CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent. The CYPHER Stent has been chosen by cardiologists worldwide to treat more than two million patients with coronary artery disease and is the world's leading drug-eluting stent. Also contributing to the performance of the segment is the continued growth of DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma businesses; Vistakon's disposable contact lenses; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive products; and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products. During the quarter, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Animas Corporation, a leading manufacturer of insulin infusion pumps and related products. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $5.6 billion for the first quarter represented a 2.2% decrease as compared to the prior year with an operational decline of .4% and a negative impact from currency of 1.8%. Domestic sales decreased 2.2%, while international sales increased 2.9% from operations, which was more than offset by the negative effects of currency of 5.3% for a reported decrease of 2.4%. Sales results for DURAGESIC, a transdermal patch for chronic pain; ULTRACET, an analgesic; and SPORANOX, an antifungal, were all negatively impacted by generic competition. Offsetting the impact of generic competition was the strong performance of RISPERDAL, an antipsychotic medication; REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases; TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches; and CONCERTA, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the quarter, the European Commission granted marketing authorization in the 25 member states of the European Union for the use of IONSYS (fentanyl hydrochloride). IONSYS is the first needle-free, iontophoretic, patient-controlled transdermal system to receive marketing authorization. It is indicated for the management of acute moderate to severe post-operative pain, for use by adults, in a hospital setting. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $2.4 billion for the first quarter represented a 3.3% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 4.5% and a negative impact from currency of 1.2%. Domestic sales increased 3.2%, while international sales increased 5.7% from operations, partially offset by negative currency of 2.4% for reported growth of 3.3%. Sales growth reflects strong performance by the skin care lines of AVEENO, NEUTROGENA and JOHNSON'S adult skin products. Wound care products and baby and child care products also contributed to the results in the Consumer segment. During the quarter, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Groupe Vendome, a privately held French marketer of adult and baby skin care products. On March 8, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to buy back up to $5 billion of the corporation's common stock. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 230 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 116,000 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world. * Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the gain associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement and in-process research and development charges are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

Previously reported financial statements have been restated accordingly. (2) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) is the Guidant acquisition termination fee of $622 million and $368 million and $0.12 per share, respectively, and IPR&D of $37 million and $29 million and $0.01 per share, respectively. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger-related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
