Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports 2006 Second Quarter EPS Increase of 10.5% on Sales Increase of 4.7% New Brunswick, NJ (July 18, 2006) - Johnson & Johnson today announced record sales for the second quarter of $13.4 billion, an increase of 4.7% as compared to the second quarter of 2005. Operational growth was 4.8% with a negative currency impact of .1%. Domestic sales were up 4.4%, while international sales increased 5.1%, reflecting operational growth of 5.2% and a negative currency impact of .1%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 were $2.8 billion and $.95, respectively. The second quarter included an after-tax in-process research and development charge of $87 million associated with the acquisition of Vascular Control Systems Inc. Prior-year second quarter net earnings included after-tax in-process research and development charges of $353 million associated with the acquisitions of Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CLOSURE Medical Corporation and TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2005 also included a gain of $225 million for a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Excluding the impact of these items, net earnings for the current quarter were $2.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $.98, representing increases of 7.0% and 8.9%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2005.* "Our second quarter results demonstrated improving performance, which is anticipated to continue throughout the remainder of the year," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have made a number of business- building investments and have received several significant regulatory product approvals. These investments and approvals will help us both sustain important leadership positions as well as enter new high growth markets characterized by unmet medical need." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $5.2 billion for the second quarter represented a 6.2% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 6.7% and a negative impact from currency of .5%. Domestic sales increased 8.9%, while international sales increased 3.5% (4.6% from operations less 1.1% from negative currency). Primary contributors to the operational growth included Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive products; Cordis' CYPHERr Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent; Vistakon's disposable contact lenses and LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products. During the quarter, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Vascular Control Systems, Inc., a privately held company focused on developing medical devices to treat fibroids and to control bleeding in obstetric and gynecologic applications. In July, the Company acquired Colbar LifeScience Ltd., a privately held biotechnology company specializing in reconstructive medicine and tissue engineering. In addition, the Company received CE Mark approval in Europe for CYPHER SELECTTM PLUS, the first third-generation drug- eluting stent to receive such an approval. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $5.8 billion for the second quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 3.2% on both a reported and an operational basis. Domestic sales increased 2.4%, while international sales increased 4.7%. Sales growth reflects the strong performance of RISPERDALr (risperidone), an antipsychotic medication; REMICADEr (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; TOPAMAXr (topiramate), an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches, and CONCERTAr (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of the anti-HIV medication PREZISTATM (darunavir). The FDA also approved IONSYSTM (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system), the first needle-free, patient-activated analgesic system; and REMICADEr (infliximab) for reducing signs and symptoms in pediatric patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. JURNISTATM prolonged-release tablets (Hydromorphone HCl), a new prescription treatment for severe pain, received approval through the European Mutual Recognition Procedure. In addition, the Company submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for Paliperidone prolonged-release tablets, a once daily, oral medication for the treatment of schizophrenia. Also during the quarter, the Company completed an agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop and commercialize Vertex's investigational hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, VX-950. The Company will have exclusive rights in Europe, South America, the Middle East, Africa and Australia. In June, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement with Metabolex, Inc., for an exclusive license for worldwide development and commercialization of metaglidasen and MBX-2044, two compounds in clinical development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $2.4 billion for the second quarter represented a 5.3% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 4.5% and a positive impact from currency of .8%. Domestic sales increased 1.0%, while international sales increased 9.2% (7.7% from operations and 1.5% from currency). Sales growth reflects strong performance by the skin care lines of AVEENOr and JOHNSON'S adult skin products. Baby & Child Care products and McNeil Nutritional's SPLENDAr sweetener also contributed to the results in the Consumer segment. The acquisition of Groupe Vendome, a privately held French marketer of adult and baby skin care products, was completed during the quarter. In addition, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pfizer Consumer Healthcare for $16.6 billion in cash. The transaction is projected to close by the end of 2006 and is subject to customary clearances, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and European Union merger control regulation. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 230 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 116,200 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world. * Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding in- process research and development charges and a revised tax impact for the American Jobs Creation Act are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

Previously reported financial statements have been restated accordingly. (2) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) is the Guidant acquisition termination fee of $622 million and $368 million and $0.12 per share, respectively, and IRP&D of $124 million and $116 million and $0.04 per share, respectively. (3) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings is the exclusion of IPR&D of $353 million before tax with no tax benefit, or $0.12 per share, and the exclusion of a $225 million tax gain, or $0.08 per share, due to the reversal of a tax liability related to a technical correction associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger-related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
