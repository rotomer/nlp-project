Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports 2006 Third-Quarter Results: Sales Increase of 7.9% and EPS of $.94 Versus $.85 a Year Ago; Excluding In-Process Research and Development Charges, EPS Increased 15.3% * NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct 17, 2006 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Johnson & Johnson today announced sales for the third quarter of $13.3 billion, an increase of 7.9% as compared to the third quarter of 2005. Operational growth was 6.7% with a positive currency impact of 1.2%. Domestic sales were up 7.5%, while international sales increased 8.5%, reflecting operational growth of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 2.8%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 were $2.8 billion and $.94, respectively. The third quarter included after- tax in-process research and development charges of $115 million associated with the acquisitions of Ensure Medical, Inc. and Colbar LifeScience Ltd. Excluding the impact of these charges, net earnings for the current quarter were $2.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $.98, representing increases of 13.3% and 15.3%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2005.* "Each of our business segments -- pharmaceuticals, medical devices and diagnostics and consumer products -- contributed to our solid third-quarter results," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strategic principle of being broadly based in human health care products continues to serve us well." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $5.0 billion for the third quarter represented a 7.1% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 6.1% and a positive impact from currency of 1.0%. Domestic sales increased 6.1%, while international sales increased 8.2% (6.1% from operations and 2.1% from currency). Primary contributors to the operational growth included Ethicon Endo- Surgery's minimally invasive products; Vistakon's disposable contact lenses; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma businesses; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products, and Ethicon's wound care and women's health products. During the quarter, the Company announced the acquisition of Ensure Medical, Inc., a privately held company that develops devices for post- catheterization closure of the femoral artery. The Company also received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its PRECISE Nitinol Stent and ANGIOGUARD Emboli Capture Guidewire to treat clogged neck arteries, known as carotid artery disease. In addition, the Company received CE Mark approval in Europe for CYPHER SELECT Sirolimus-eluting Stent for use in the treatment of severe arterial disease in the leg, the first drug-eluting stent to receive such an approval. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $5.9 billion for the third quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 7.8% with operational growth of 6.7% and a positive impact from currency of 1.1%. Domestic sales increased 8.9%, while international sales increased 5.7% (2.7% from operations and 3.0% from currency). Sales growth reflects the strong performance of RISPERDAL, an antipsychotic medication; REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches, and CONCERTA, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the quarter, the Company received an approvable letter from the FDA regarding a New Drug Application for paliperidone extended-release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia. The FDA also approved REMICADE (infliximab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis. In October, the Company received approval from the FDA to market RISPERDAL (risperidone) for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder, marking the first FDA-approved treatment for children and adolescents afflicted with autistic disorder. Also during the quarter, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with MGI PHARMA, INC. for the exclusive development and commercialization rights in all countries outside the United States, Canada and Mexico for DACOGEN (decitabine), an injectable product in European clinical development for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $2.5 billion for the third quarter represented a 10.1% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 8.1% and a positive impact from currency of 2.0%. Domestic sales increased 5.9%, while international sales increased 14.0% (10.2% from operations and 3.8% from currency). Sales results reflect McNeil Consumer's launch of its reformulated TYLENOL over-the-counter upper respiratory products; international growth in skin care products primarily associated with the recent acquisition of Group Vendome, and strong growth in Baby & Child Care products. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 230 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 115,700 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world. *Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding in- process research and development charges are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

(3) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) and adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income and net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) is the exclusion of IPR&D of $353 million before tax with no tax benefit and $0.12 per share, and the exclusion of a $225 million tax gain and $0.08 per share, due to the reversal of a tax liability related to a technical correction associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger- related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
