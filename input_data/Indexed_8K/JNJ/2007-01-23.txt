Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Results 2006 Fourth-Quarter EPS Rose 5.7% on Sales Increase of 8.5% 2006 Full-Year EPS Rose 11.3% on Sales Increase of 5.6% Excluding Special Items, 2006 Fourth-Quarter EPS Rose 15.7% and Full-Year EPS Rose 10.9%* NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan 23, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Johnson & Johnson today announced record sales of $13.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 8.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Operational growth was 6.2% with a positive currency impact of 2.3%. Domestic sales were up 6.4%, while international sales increased 11.2%, reflecting operational growth of 6.0% and a positive currency impact of 5.2%. Worldwide sales for the year 2006 were $53.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% over 2005, increasing operationally by 5.3% with currency contributing .3%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $2.2 billion and $.74 respectively. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 included an after- tax charge for in-process research and development of $217 million associated with the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare. Excluding this charge, 2006 fourth-quarter net earnings were $2.4 billion and earnings per share were $.81, representing increases of 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2005.* Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the year, as reported, were $11.1 billion and $3.73, increases of 9.9% and 11.3%, respectively, as compared with 2005. Full-year 2006 net earnings included after-tax charges for in-process research and development of $448 million and an after-tax gain of $368 million associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement. Full-year 2005 net earnings included after-tax charges for in- process research and development of $359 million and a gain of $225 million for a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Excluding these items, net earnings for the year were $11.1 billion and earnings per share were $3.76, representing increases of 9.2% and 10.9%, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2005.* "Johnson & Johnson had a solid year in 2006, delivering double-digit growth in earnings per share while continuing to invest in building our businesses for the future," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We're very excited about the completion of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare acquisition, which not only brings to Johnson & Johnson some of the world's premier consumer brands, but also builds upon our broad base in human health care." Worldwide, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved annual sales of $20.3 billion in 2006, representing an increase over the prior year of 6.2% with operational growth of 6.4% and a negative currency impact of .2%. Domestic sales increased 6.5%, while international sales increased 5.9% (6.2% from operations less .3% from negative currency). Primary contributors to the operational growth included Ethicon Endo- Surgery's minimally invasive products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma businesses; Vistakon's disposable contact lenses, and LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products. During the quarter, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Conor Medsystems, Inc., a cardiovascular device company with a unique controlled drug delivery technology. The Company also received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first blood-screening test for Chagas' disease, a tropical, parasitic disease. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $23.3 billion for the full- year 2006 represented an increase of 4.2% versus the prior year with operational growth of 3.9% and a positive impact from currency of .3%. Domestic sales increased 4.2%, while international sales also increased 4.2% (3.4% from operations and .8% from currency). Sales growth reflects the strong performance of RISPERDAL, an antipsychotic medication; REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases; TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches; VELCADE, a treatment for multiple myeloma, and CONCERTA, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the quarter, the Company received approval from the FDA for INVEGA (paliperidone) Extended-Release Tablets, a new atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. The Company also submitted a new drug application to the FDA for doripenem, an antibiotic for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and complicated urinary tract infections. In addition, the Company submitted a supplemental new drug application for DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) as combination therapy with VELCADE (bortezomib) to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Worldwide Consumer segment annual sales in 2006 were $9.8 billion, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year with operational growth of 6.4% and a positive impact from currency of 1.1%. Domestic sales increased 3.8%, while international sales increased 10.9% (8.7% from operations and 2.2% from currency). Sales results reflect growth in the skin care lines of AVEENO, JOHNSON's adult skin products, CLEAN & CLEAR, as well as sun care and products from the acquisition of Group Vendome. Strong growth in Baby & Child Care products also contributed to the results. Late in the quarter, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, creating the world's premier consumer health care company. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 200 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 122,000 men and women and sell products throughout the world. * Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding in-process research and development charges, the gain associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement, and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

Adjusted net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) also exclude a tax gain of $225 million and $0.08 per share, respectively, due to the reversal of a tax liability related to a technical correction associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger- related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
