Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports 2007 First-Quarter Results: Sales Increase of 15.7% and EPS of $.88 Versus $1.10 a Year Ago; Excluding Special Items, EPS was $1.16, an increase of 17.2% * NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 17, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Johnson & Johnson today announced record first-quarter sales of $15.0 billion, an increase of 15.7% as compared to the first quarter of 2006. Operational growth was 13.3% with a positive currency impact of 2.4%. Domestic sales were up 11.9%, while international sales increased 20.8%, reflecting operational growth of 15.4% and a positive currency impact of 5.4%. On a pro-forma basis, including the net impact of the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in both periods, worldwide sales increased 6.3% operationally. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 were $2.6 billion and $.88, respectively. The first quarter of 2007 included an after-tax in-process research and development charge of $807 million associated with the acquisition of Conor Medsystems, Inc. The first quarter of 2006 included an after-tax gain of $368 million associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement as well as after-tax in- process research and development charges of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Hand Innovations LLC and Future Medical Systems S.A. Excluding the impact of these special items, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.16, representing increases of 14.0% and 17.2%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2006.* "Our solid first-quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broadly- based businesses, especially the strong performance of our pharmaceutical business," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are delighted to add the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and Conor Medsystems businesses to the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. Our strategy of being broadly-based continues to serve us well and is one of the keys to our consistent long- term performance." Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $5.3 billion for the first quarter represented a 6.2% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 3.7% and a positive impact from currency of 2.5%. Domestic sales increased 2.5%, while international sales increased 9.8% (4.7% from operations and 5.1% from currency). Primary contributors to the operational growth included Vistakon's disposable contact lenses; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive products; Ethicon's wound care and women's health products, and DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma businesses. This growth was partially offset by challenges faced by Cordis in the drug-eluting stent market. During the quarter, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of Conor Medsystems, Inc., a cardiovascular device company with a unique controlled drug-delivery technology. In April, the Company submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its adjustable gastric band, an implantable device for the treatment of morbid obesity. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $6.2 billion for the first quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 10.6% with operational growth of 8.6% and a positive impact from currency of 2.0%. Domestic sales increased 9%, while international sales increased 13.6% (7.7% from operations and 5.9% from currency). Sales growth reflects the strong performance of TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches; LEVAQUIN, an anti- infective, and our antipsychotic franchise, which includes RISPERDAL, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA. During the quarter, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for PREZISTA, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity for both LEVAQUIN and RISPERDAL, extending the marketing exclusivity for these products by an additional six months. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.5 billion for the first quarter represented a 48.5% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 45.7% and a positive impact from currency of 2.8%. Domestic sales increased 41.7%, while international sales increased 54.9% (49.4% from operations and 5.5% from currency). On a pro-forma basis, including the net impact of the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in both periods, worldwide sales for the Consumer segment increased 6.7% operationally. Sales growth in the combined business reflects the strong performance of McNeil Consumer's reformulated TYLENOL over- the-counter upper respiratory products; LISTERINE antiseptic mouthrinse; the skin care lines of AVEENO and CLEAN & CLEAR; BENADRYL allergy products; ROGAINE hair regrowth treatment, and VISINE eye care products. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 250 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 121,000 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world. *Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding in- process research and development charges and the gain associated with the termination of the Guidant acquisition agreement are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

(2) The difference between as reported earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings and net earnings per share (diluted) is the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee income of $622 million, $368 million and $0.12 per share, respectively, and IPR&D of $37 million, $29 million and $0.01 per share, respectively. (A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger- related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
