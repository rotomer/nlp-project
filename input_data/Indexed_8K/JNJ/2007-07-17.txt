Exhibit 99.15 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Johnson & Johnson Reports 2007 Second-Quarter Results: Sales Increase of 13.2% and EPS increase of 10.5% Versus a Year Ago; Excluding Special Charges in 2006, EPS increased 7.1%* New Brunswick, NJ (July 17, 2007) - Johnson & Johnson today announced second-quarter sales of $15.1 billion, an increase of 13.2% as compared to the second quarter of 2006. Operational growth was 10.8% and currency contributed 2.4%. Domestic sales were up 9.0%, while international sales increased 18.4%, reflecting operational growth of 13.0% and a positive currency impact of 5.4%. On a pro-forma basis, including the net impact of the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in both periods, worldwide sales increased 3.6% operationally. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2007 were $3.1 billion and $1.05, respectively. Prior- year second-quarter net earnings included an after-tax in-process research and development charge of $87 million associated with the acquisition of Vascular Control Systems, Inc. Excluding this charge, net earnings for the current quarter and diluted earnings per share represent increases of 6.0% and 7.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2006.* The Company confirmed its previous earnings guidance for full year 2007, which excludes the impact of in-process research and development charges or other special items, of between $4.02 and $4.07 per share. "Our broadly-based approach to health care is serving us well as challenges in the marketplace intensify across certain businesses," said William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to grow earnings while successfully integrating acquisitions and continuing to invest in promising new growth opportunities." In July, the Company announced a $10 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases will take place on the open market from time to time based on market conditions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics sales of $5.4 billion for the second quarter represented a 5.1% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 2.8% and a positive impact from currency of 2.3%. Domestic sales increased 1.1%, while international sales increased 9.1% (4.4% from operations and 4.7% from currency). Primary contributors to the operational growth included Vistakon's disposable contact lenses; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and sports medicine businesses; Ethicon's wound care and women's health products; and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products. This growth was largely offset by lower sales of drug-eluting stents in our Cordis franchise due to a decline in the market versus the prior year. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $6.1 billion for the second quarter represented an increase over the prior year of 5.8% with operational growth of 3.8% and a positive impact from currency of 2.0%. Domestic sales increased 4.8%, while international sales increased 7.6% (2.0% from operations and 5.6% from currency). Sales growth reflects the strong performance of TOPAMAX, an antiepileptic and a treatment for the prevention of migraine headaches; REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; our antipsychotic franchise, which includes RISPERDAL, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA; and CONCERTA, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During the quarter, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for INVEGA, an atypical antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for an additional indication for INVEGA for long-term maintenance of schizophrenia. In May, the FDA approved the use of DOXIL in combination with VELCADE for Injection to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have not previously received VELCADE and have received at least one prior therapy. Also in the quarter, the Company filed new drug applications in both the U.S. and Europe for ceftobiprole, an antibiotic for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Doripenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, was filed in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and in Europe for complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra- abdominal infections. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion for the second quarter represented a 48.6% increase over the prior year with operational growth of 45.1% and a positive impact from currency of 3.5%. Domestic sales increased 41.6%, while international sales increased 54.6% (48.1% from operations and 6.5% from currency). On a pro-forma basis, including the net impact of the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in both periods, worldwide sales for the Consumer segment increased 4.6% operationally. Sales growth in the combined business reflects the strong performance of the skin care lines of NEUTROGENA and AVEENO; Baby and Kids Care products; and LISTERINE antiseptic mouthrinse. Johnson & Johnson is the world's most comprehensive and broadly based manufacturer of health care products, as well as a provider of related services, for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The more than 250 Johnson & Johnson operating companies employ approximately 120,500 men and women in 57 countries and sell products throughout the world. * Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding after- tax in-process research and development charges are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.

(A) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings," "adjusted net earnings per share (diluted)," and "adjusted effective tax rate" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as business development activities (including IPR&D at acquisition or upon attainment of milestones and any extraordinary expenses), strategic developments (including restructuring and product line changes), significant litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings before provision for taxes on income, net earnings, net earnings per share (diluted), and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted), and adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, merger-related or other restructuring charges, or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
