Item 8.01    Other Events.
 
On December 19, 2011, the Compensation & Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Johnson & Johnson (the Company) approved (i) a revised Form of Certificate - Stock Option (Stock Option Certificate), (ii) a revised Form of Certificate - Restricted Share Unit (RSU Certificate) and (iii) a new Form of Certificate - Performance Share Unit (PSU Certificate and collectively with the Stock Option Certificate and RSU Certificate, the Forms of Certificate) for use under the Johnson & Johnson 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which plan was approved by shareholders of the Company during the annual meeting of shareholders held on April 28, 2005.
The Stock Option Certificate and RSU Certificate are substantially similar to the prior forms and were modified to reflect the following: (i) upon a termination due to Disability, unvested options and unvested restricted share units will immediately vest upon termination; (ii) upon a termination for Cause, vested options are immediately forfeited, and (iii) the term Retire or Retirement is consistently defined as the attainment of 55 years of age. Other than as set forth above, the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Certificate and RSU Certificate remain unchanged.
The PSU Certificate provides for the grant of units that are subject to both the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Committee (which may vary from award to award) and the continued employment with the Company. The performance share units are settleable in shares of Company Common Stock (or, at the discretion of the Committee, the cash equivalent) following the end of a three-year performance period. The PSU Certificate provides for the following termination provisions, provided the employee has held the award for at least six months: (i) upon Death or Disability, the award immediately vests at 100% of target, with additional shares awarded after the end of the three-year performance period if the actual performance exceeds target and (ii) upon normal Retirement, the award vests in accordance with the normal vesting period, provided that if the grantee is hired by a competitor within 18 months of such Retirement, the grantee forfeits the unvested award. Additionally, unvested performance share units are forfeited upon a termination that is less than six months from the grant date or in the case of: (i) early Retirement, (ii) termination without Cause, (iii) voluntary termination, or (iv) termination for Cause. The performance share units are subject to the Company's Compensation Recoupment Policy, as amended from time to time.
The Form of Certificate - Stock Option is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K, the Form of Certificate - Restricted Share Unit is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K, and the Form of Certificate - Performance Share Unit is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Form 8-K. The foregoing description of the Forms of Certificate is qualified by reference to the terms of the actual forms of certificate filed herewith. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth in the actual Forms of Certificate.

Vesting and Earning of Units
.
(a)
    
General
. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, on the Settlement Date you shall have the right to earn a number of Units, if any, based upon the achievement of specified levels of performance during the Performance Period, as set forth in
Appendix A
hereto, provided in addition that on the Vesting Date you are, and have been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee of the Company. For purposes of the Units, persons on Company-approved leaves of absence are considered employees of the Company, but persons on long-term disability are not considered employees of the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
(b)
    
Termination of Employment
. If, prior to the Vesting Date, you cease to be employed by the Company for any reason, including termination for Cause, then except as otherwise provided in Section 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), or 2(f) hereof, the Units shall become null and void on the Date of Termination.
(c)
    
Death While Actively Employed
. If, prior to the Vesting Date, you die while actively employed by the Company, then your estate or any person who acquires the Units by inheritance or devise shall (i) immediately become vested in the Units on the Date of Termination, (ii) have the right to earn the Target Number of Units plus the Top-up Number of Units, and (iii) receive a number of shares of Common Stock, if any, or cash equivalent, as provided in Section 4 hereof.
(d)
    
Disability
. If, prior to the Vesting Date, you cease to be employed by the Company due to Disability, then you (or should you die, your estate or any person who acquires the Units by inheritance or devise) shall (i) immediately become vested in the Units on the Date of Termination, (ii) have the right to earn the Target Number of Units plus the Top-up Number of Units, and (iii) receive a number shares of Common Stock, if any, or cash equivalent, as provided in Section 4 hereof.
(e)
    
Retirement
. If, prior to the Vesting Date, you Retire from employment with the Company without being terminated for Cause and either (i) you have at least ten (10) years of Service with at least five (5) consecutive years of Service immediately before your Date of Termination, or (ii) you have attained age 62 as of your Date of Termination, then you shall (1) become vested in the Units on the Vesting Date, (2) have the right to earn a number of Units, if any, based upon the achievement of specified levels of performance during the Performance Period, as set forth in
Appendix A
, and (3) receive a number of shares of Common Stock, if any, or cash equivalent, as provided in Section 4 hereof,
provided that
you will be treated as having terminated employment pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof if at any time prior to the Vesting Date the Committee determines that applying this Section 2(e) to retirees (based on age at the time of termination) and not to all employees violates any law or public policy applicable to you and/or the Units (whether as applied to all holders of Units or only holders of Units in the jurisdiction where you are employed). For the avoidance of doubt, if you are eligible for Retirement and you are terminated for Cause, then this Section 2(e) shall not apply and the Units shall become null and void on the Date of Termination.
(f)
    
Death Following Retirement
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you die following your Retirement pursuant to Section 2(e) hereof but prior to the Vesting Date, then your estate or any person who acquires the Units by inheritance or devise shall (i) immediately become vested in the Units on the Date of Termination, (ii) have the right to earn the Target Number of Units plus the Top-up Number of Units, and (iii) receive a number of shares of Common Stock, if any, or cash equivalent, as provided in Section 4 hereof.
(g)
    
Units Granted Within Six (6) Months of Termination.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2, if the Grant Date occurred within the six (6) months immediately preceding your Date of Termination, and your termination of employment was for any reason other than death or Disability, the Units shall become null and void on your Date of Termination.
(h)
    
Employment by a Competitor
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(d) and 2(e) hereof, if you ceased to be employed by the Company due to Disability or Retirement and you become Employed by a Competitor within eighteen (18) months after your Date of Termination, (i) if your termination was due to Disability, the Top-up Number of Units shall become null and void, and (ii) if your termination was due to Retirement, the Units shall become null and void, in each case on the date you are first Employed by a Competitor.
3.
    
Rights to Common Stock

not
have any rights in, or with respect to, any of the shares of Common Stock that may be issued or transferred to you pursuant to Section 4 hereof, including, but not limited to, any voting rights and the right to receive any dividends (or dividend equivalents) that may be paid or any distributions that may be made with respect to such Common Stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any law or regulation requires Johnson & Johnson to take any action with respect to such shares before the issuance thereof, the date of delivery of such shares shall be extended for the period necessary to complete such action.
(b)
    
Registration and Listing
