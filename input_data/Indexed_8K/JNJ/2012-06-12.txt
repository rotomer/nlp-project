Item 1.01.Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
  
Final settlement of the transactions under each ASR agreement is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2013, and may occur earlier at the option of Goldman Sachs or J.P.Morgan, as applicable, or later under certain circumstances.  The terms of the transactions under each ASR agreement are subject to adjustment if Johnson & Johnson were to enter into or announce certain types of transactions.   Janssen may receive, or be required to remit, a price adjustment based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of Johnson & Johnson common stock during the term of the ASR program.  During the term of the ASR program, and subject to certain limited exceptions, Janssen and Johnson & Johnson may only make repurchases of Johnson & Johnson common stock with the consent of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.  Under each ASR agreement, Janssen has the right to cancel the agreement prior to accepting delivery of the repurchased shares from Goldman Sachs or J.P.Morgan, as applicable.  Janssen also has the right to cancel and effect an early settlement of each agreement by delivery of approximately the full aggregate number of shares underlying each ASR agreement, in exchange for the return of the purchase price under the ASR agreements, within six days of accepting delivery of the purchased shares.
On June 12, 2012, Janssen Pharmaceutical, a company organized under the laws of Ireland and a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (J.P. Morgan).  Under the ASR agreements Janssen Pharmaceutical will purchase shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock that Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan will have borrowed from stock lenders, and during the term of the ASR agreements Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan or their respective affiliates will purchase shares in the open market to return to those stock lenders.  On June 13, 2012, Janssen Pharmaceutical will purchase an aggregate of approximately 203.7 million shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at an initial purchase price of $12.9 billion under the ASR agreements, with all of the shares expected to be delivered to Janssen Pharmaceutical on June 13, 2012.  The obligations of Janssen Pharmaceutical under the ASR agreements, other than the payment of the purchase price for the shares, are guaranteed by Johnson & Johnson.  Goldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan are expected to purchase an aggregate of approximately $12.9 billion of shares in the open market during the next 12 months.

The ASR program and Johnson & Johnsons associated guarantees were approved by Johnson & Johnsons board of directors on June 12, 2012.
The foregoing summary of the ASR agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to each Cover Letter for Accelerated Share Repurchase (including the Schedule of Standard Terms and Conditions, attached thereto as Annex I) and each guarantee of Johnson & Johnson, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01.Other Events.
  
                Regulatory Update and Calculation of Merger Consideration
On June 12, 2012, Johnson & Johnson announced that it has received all regulatory approvals necessary for the completion of its proposed acquisition of Synthes, Inc. (Synthes), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 26, 2011, among Johnson & Johnson, Samson Acquisition Corp. and Synthes (the Merger Agreement).   The European Commission granted its antitrust approval for the transaction on April 19, 2012.  On June 11, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) granted early termination of the requisite waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  The FTC also voted to accept a proposed consent order regarding the acquisition.  The proposed consent order requires Johnson & Johnson to divest to an FTC-approved buyer certain rights and assets related to its DePuy trauma business.  As previously announced, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, has entered into an agreement to divest its trauma business to Biomet, Inc.  The divestiture is expected to close in the second quarter.  Johnson & Johnson expects to close the transaction with Synthes on June 14, 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions on that date. Synthes stockholders approved the transaction at a special meeting held on December 15, 2011.
 
If the acquisition closes on that date, each outstanding share of Synthes common stock will be converted into the right to receive CHF 55.65 in cash and 1.7170 shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock (subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for a total purchase price of $19.7 billion based on current exchange rates and the trading price of Johnson & Johnson common stock. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, the exchange ratio was calculated based on the average of the volume weighted average trading prices (VWAP) of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the effective time of the merger, as converted into CHF on each day during this valuation period (beginning May 30, 2012 and ending, June 12, 2012).  The average VWAP of Johnson & Johnson common stock during the valuation period was CHF 60.1920.  Since the average VWAP was within the collar range of CHF 52.54 and CHF 60.45, the exchange ratio was calculated by dividing CHF 103.35 by the average VWAP of Johnson & Johnson common stock.  The exchange ratio may change if the closing of the acquisition is not completed on June 14, 2012.

As permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, Johnson & Johnson has assigned its rights under the Merger Agreement to Janssen No third party debt is expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition.
Pharmaceutical.  Janssen Pharmaceutical will acquire Synthes using cash on hand and the shares purchased under the ASR agreements.  
Financial Impact
Based on the financial structure indicated above, the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to 2012 adjusted earnings per share* by approximately $0.03 - $0.05.  Johnson & Johnson had previously disclosed in its S-4 filing that the acquisition was anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share by $0.22, based on 2010 financial information.  The current estimate reflects a mid-year 2012 closing date as well as current sales estimates for the combined orthopaedics business.  In addition, Johnson & Johnson expects to record estimated after-tax special items for the balance of 2012 consisting of charges of approximately $1.1 billion related to the acquisition including restructuring and integration costs, inventory step-up and currency adjustments.   In 2013, the first full year of the combined businesses, the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share* by $0.10 - $0.15.
(* Adjusted earnings per share excludes special items such as inventory step-up, restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction. Adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results.)
Certain risk factors on the financial structure and impact of the transaction, as well as certain updated information with respect to the Swiss tax consequences of the transaction, are discussed in the Note to Investors section below and investors are encouraged to read that information carefully.
A copy of the press release announcing, among other things, the entry into the ASR agreements, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and the exchange ratio is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The anticipated financial effect of the transactions as set forth above assumes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions are consummated on their terms and in accordance with applicable law.  The transactions are intended to efficiently combine the respective businesses of Synthes and DePuy, a family of companies within Johnson & Johnson providing healthcare solutions in orthopaedics, spinal care, sports medicine and neurosciences. While Johnson & Johnson believes that these transactions will allow it to effectuate the acquisition in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to Johnson & Johnson, plus interest.
As previously disclosed, Swiss-resident individual taxpayers holding Synthes shares as their private property should realize a tax-free private capital gain or a non-tax-deductible loss, as the case may be, with respect to all or part of the merger consideration, but a portion of the merger consideration might be treated as dividend income.  This will depend on the structure used to finance the acquisition.  Based on the current financing structure and current exchange rates, we expect that no such portion of the merger consideration should be treated as dividend income for those Swiss-resident taxpayers.  In addition, according to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the transaction is, unless a personal exemption applies to the individual stockholder, subject to Swiss securities transfer tax, which will be deducted from the merger consideration by the custodian banks.
Synthes stockholders should consult with their individual tax advisors to determine the tax consequences of the acquisition in light of their particular circumstances, including what tax planning opportunities might be available to them.

Re:  
Cover Letter for Accelerated Share Repurchase
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the ) agrees to sell to Janssen Pharmaceutical, a company organized under the laws of Ireland and acting on its own behalf and not as an agent of any other entity (the ), and the Company agrees to purchase from the Seller, for settlement (share delivery) on June 13, 2012 (the ), 101,870,028 shares (the ) of capital stock, par value $1.00 per share (the ), of Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey corporation (the ), at a purchase price equal to $6,425,961,366 (the ) on a free delivery basis.  Delivery of the Initial Shares shall be made at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time (the ), on the Purchase Date, to an account specified by the Company prior to such time, and the Seller shall not deliver any of the Initial Shares to the Company earlier than the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to increase or decrease the number of Initial Shares to not more than 101,870,028 shares (the ) and not less than 101,870,028 shares (the ) by written notice, which may be delivered by electronic mail, to the Seller prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Purchase Date (a ); provided that such Change Notice shall contain a representation and warranty of the Company to the Seller that at the time such notice is delivered, none of the Company and its officers and directors is aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Issuer or the Common Stock.  If the Seller is unable to borrow, on commercially reasonable terms, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice but without reduction as set forth in this sentence) and deliver such shares to the Company on the Purchase Date, then the number of Initial Shares shall be reduced to such number of shares of Common Stock as the Seller is able to so borrow and deliver and the Purchase Price shall be reduced correspondingly (a ).  In addition, if the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice and after giving effect to any Borrow Unavailability Reduction) is less than the Maximum Initial Shares, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock by which the Maximum Initial Shares exceeds such number of Initial Shares and (y) $63.08, and if prior to such reduction a higher Purchase Price had been paid by the Company, then on the Trading Day immediately following the Purchase Date, the Seller shall return to the Company an amount equal to the excess of the higher Purchase Price so paid over the Purchase Price as so reduced, without interest.  The Sellers obligation to deliver the Initial Shares on the Purchase Date is conditioned upon the Companys payment of the Purchase Price at or prior to noon, New York City time, on the Purchase Date.

The Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to so borrow and deliver the Minimum Initial Shares (without giving effect to any Borrow Unavailability Reduction).  For the avoidance doubt, in using such reasonable best efforts, the Seller shall act in good faith and in accordance with its then current policies, practices and procedures (including without limitation any policies, practices or procedures relating to counterparty risk, market risk, reputational risk, credit, documentation, legal, regulatory capital, compliance and collateral), and shall not be required to enter into any securities lending transaction or transact with any potential securities lender if such transaction would not be in accordance with such policies, practices and procedures.  If the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice) exceeds the Minimum Initial Shares, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement (as defined below) to the contrary, the Seller shall not be liable in any way for any inability to borrow any shares in excess of the Minimum Initial Shares, and the only consequence of any such inability shall be a Borrow Unavailability Reduction.  Promptly upon request from the Company prior to the Earliest Delivery Time, the Seller shall orally inform the Company of the Sellers good faith estimate of the minimum number of shares of Common Stock that the Seller will be able to deliver to the Company at or after the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, the giving of any such estimate shall not alter the Sellers obligations in respect of any of the Initial Shares as set forth in the Agreement.
 
The Seller and the Company agree that time is of the essence with respect to the delivery of the Initial Shares pursuant to the Agreement (as defined below).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Seller shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any third parties, including any transfer agent, custodian, stock lender or clearance system, or of the Issuer, the Company or any affiliate or agent of the Issuer or the Company and (ii) the Seller shall not be liable for any special, consequential or indirect damages resulting from any failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Initial Shares (before any reduction as provided above) when due.  Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller shall have fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement to deliver the Initial Shares if the Seller has deposited the Initial Shares into the Sellers account at Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the ), the further transfer and delivery to the Company of the Initial Shares is not limited in any way by any action or inaction by the Seller or its affiliates and the Seller has instructed the Custodian to transfer the Initial Shares at or after the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date from such account to the Companys account at the Custodian.

The Seller and the Company agree that the sale and purchase of the Initial Shares is subject to the agreements, terms and conditions set forth in the Schedule of Standard Terms and Conditions attached hereto as , which is incorporated by reference herein and is an integral part of this agreement (the  and, together with this Cover Letter for Accelerated Share Repurchase, the ).  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Schedule.
Annex I
Schedule
Agreement
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement (including the Schedule), the following shall be conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby: (i) no later than the date hereof, the Seller and the Issuer shall enter into a guarantee agreement substantially in the form set forth in hereto (the ), (ii) the Company shall deliver to the Seller on or prior to the Purchase Date an opinion of counsel to the Company substantially to the effect set forth in the first sentence of Section 12(g) and Section 12(j) of the Schedule, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller, which opinion shall be rendered by nationally recognized outside counsel to the Company, except for the opinion substantially to the effect set forth in the first sentence of Section 12(g) of the Schedule, which may be rendered by internal counsel to the Company, (iii) the Company and the Companys Irish counsel shall have provided to the Seller and the Sellers Irish counsel such information and documents as the Seller shall have reasonably requested to allow the Sellers Irish counsel to deliver to the Seller an opinion substantially to the effect set forth in Sections 12(b), 12(g) and 12(h) of the Schedule with respect to matters of Irish law, and (iv) the Company shall complete, execute and deliver to the Seller on or prior to the Purchase Date a valid and materially accurate and complete United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor thereto).

The Company hereby informs the Seller that it intends to enter into a similar letter agreement with a separate financial institution (the ), and that it has structured each letter agreement such that no Relevant Day in such similar letter agreement is a Relevant Day under the Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agreement creates no rights or obligations as between Seller #1 and Seller #2 (each as defined below).
Other Agreement
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at any time (the ) prior to the Averaging Period Start Date, upon prior notice to the Seller.  Any such notice of cancellation shall be delivered to each of the employees of the Seller specified in Schedule I hereto, and not to any other employees or agents of the Seller.  At the time the Company gives any such notice of cancellation, or as soon thereafter as such representation and warranty would be true, the Company shall represent and warrant in writing to the Seller that none of the Company and its officers and directors is aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Issuer or the Common Stock (the ).  If the Cancellation Time occurs prior to the time (the ) at which ownership of the Initial Shares passes to the Company or its agent (the Time of Ownership to be the earliest time determined by either party in good faith upon the advice of counsel), then the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be cancelled and shall terminate without any obligation of any party thereto; provided that (i) if the Purchase Price had been paid prior to the Cancellation Time, the Seller shall promptly return the Purchase Price to the Company; (ii) the Company shall, upon reasonable request of the Seller, assist in the return of any of the Initial Shares to the Seller or to any counterparties to stock loan transactions with the Seller, and (iii) the Company shall pay to the Seller the amount of the Sellers cost to borrow shares of Common Stock (including related funding costs) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company shall not give notice of any such cancellation between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., New York City time, on any Trading Day, unless the Company shall have previously publicly disclosed the fact that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are being cancelled in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and the Seller may deem the filing of any such Form 8-K as notice of a cancellation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement), in which case the Company shall also substantially contemporaneously with such filing, give separate notice of such cancellation to the Seller, and any such notice delivered in violation of this sentence shall not be effective to cancel the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; and (B) if the Company gives notice of any such cancellation at any other time, the Company shall publicly disclose the fact that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are being cancelled in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, following the time at which such notice is given, and the Company acknowledges that failure to timely make such filing could result in significant trading losses by the Seller and its affiliates.

If the Cancellation Time occurs at or after the Time of Ownership, then the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be cancelled and shall terminate in accordance with the following terms:
 
(i)         The Company shall promptly, and in any event within two scheduled Trading Days of the Cancellation Time (but no earlier than as requested by the Seller), deliver to the Seller a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Initial Shares (the ) and, promptly following such delivery, the Seller shall return the Purchase Price to the Company; provided that such delivery and return is subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule to account for the Close-out Amount (as defined in the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement deemed to be the sole Transaction under such Master Agreement) in respect of such termination.  The Calculation Agent shall notify the parties of the amount of such adjustment, expressed both as a number of shares of Common Stock and as an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, promptly following the Cancellation Time, and the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to elect that such adjustment be effected as an adjustment to the number of Cancellation Shares so delivered by the Company to the Seller or as an adjustment to the amount of cash so returned by the Seller to the Company.  For the avoidance of doubt, in determining such Close-out Amount, the Calculation Agent shall take into account the anticipated entry into the Share Sales Agreement (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Cancellation Shares
 
(ii)         The Company shall cause the Issuer to promptly, and in any event within two scheduled Trading Days of the Cancellation Time, execute and deliver a Share Sales Agreement, substantially in the form of hereto, with the Seller (the ), covering the sale of the Cancellation Shares by the Seller or its affiliate.
Annex V
Share Sales Agreement
 
(iii)         If the number of Cancellation Shares exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock comprising Sellers net short position in respect of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement at the Cancellation Time (such latter number of shares, the ), then any Cancellation Shares in excess of the Short Position shall be  and the following provisions shall apply.  At the Cancellation Time, a notional balance (the ) shall be established with an initial balance equal to the product of the number of Excess Shares and the per share market value of the Common Stock at the Cancellation Time, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule.  The Seller or its affiliate shall, promptly following delivery of the Cancellation Shares, the execution of the Share Sales Agreement and the availability of the Prospectus (as defined therein) thereunder as provided therein, commence sales of the Excess Shares on Scheduled Relevant Days pursuant to the Share Sales Agreement, and 99% of the net proceeds of such sales shall be applied to reduce the Excess Shares Balance.  If all of the Excess Shares have been sold and the Excess Shares Balance has not been reduced to zero, then the Seller shall so notify the Company and the Company shall, within one scheduled Trading Day of such notice, either (A) pay an amount to the Seller equal to the remaining Excess Shares Balance, or (B) deliver to the Seller a number of additional shares of Common Stock () equal to (x) the remaining Excess Shares Balance divided by (y)(1) the per share market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule multiplied by (2) 99%.  The Company may elect either clause (A) or clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence in its sole discretion.  If the Company elects to deliver Make-whole Excess Shares, those Make-whole Excess Shares will be deemed to be Excess Shares pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) and the provisions of this subparagraph (iii) shall apply until the Excess Shares Balance has been reduced to zero (for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of Make-whole Excess Shares shall not increase the Excess Shares Balance).  If at any time the Excess Shares Balance has been reduced to zero and the Seller or its affiliate has so sold fewer than all of Excess Shares and any Make-whole Excess Shares, then the Seller shall promptly return to the Company any Excess Shares or Make-whole Excess Shares remaining unsold at the time the Excess Shares Balance is reduced to zero.  For the avoidance of doubt, sales of the Excess Shares and any Make-whole Excess Shares pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) shall be completed prior to the commencement of sales of the Cancellation Shares that are not Excess Shares pursuant to the Share Sales Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to deliver more than the Maximum Deliverable Number of shares of Common Stock as Make-whole Excess Shares hereunder.

If the Company cancels the transactions contemplated by the Other Agreement pursuant to a cancellation right similar to that described above, the Company shall immediately notify the Seller, and, if the Company does not elect to cancel the transactions contemplated by the Agreement substantially contemporaneously with such cancellation of the transactions contemplated by the Other Agreement, then the Seller shall have the right to cancel the transactions contemplated by the Agreement with the same effect as if the Company had elected to cancel the transactions contemplated by the Agreement as provided above.

 means any tax imposed on payments treated as dividends from sources within the United States under Section 871(m) of the Code.
Dividend Equivalent Tax
 
 means any tax imposed under Section 1471 or 1472 of the Code (or the United States Treasury regulations or other guidance issued or any agreements entered into thereunder).
FATCA Withholding Tax
 
 means any Tax other than a Tax that would not be imposed in respect of a payment under the Agreement but for a present or former connection between the jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority imposing such Tax and the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient (including, without limitation, a connection arising from such recipient or related person being or having been a citizen or resident of such jurisdiction, or being or having been organized, present or engaged in a trade or business in such jurisdiction, or having or having had a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in such jurisdiction, but excluding a connection arising solely from such recipient or related person having executed, delivered, performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, the Agreement or a Credit Support Document), excluding (i) any Dividend Equivalent Tax and (ii) any FATCA Withholding Tax.
Indemnifiable Tax
 
 means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by any government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under the Agreement other than a stamp, registration, documentation or similar tax.
Tax
 
      Subject to Section 19(e), all payments under the Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant government or taxation authority, then in effect.  If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party () will:
(b)
X
 
(i)      promptly notify the other party () of such requirement;
Y
 
(ii)     pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 19) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
 
(iii)    promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
 
(iv)    if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under the Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for the failure by Y to:
 
 
 
30
 
 
 
     deliver to X any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Agreement by the date specified in the Agreement, or if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable; or
(A)
 
      deliver to X or, in certain cases, to such government or taxation authority as X reasonably directs, upon reasonable demand by X, any other form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow X or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under the Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the party in receipt of such demand is legally entitled to complete, execute and submit such form or document and the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such party), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification as soon as reasonably practicable (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the ).
(B)
Tax Requirements
 
      If:
(c)
 
(i)      X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant government or taxation authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 19(b)(iv);
 
(ii)     X does not so deduct or withhold; and
 
(iii)    a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X;
 
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied (including by making a payment to X pursuant to Section 19(d)) or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any Tax Requirement).
 
      For all purposes of this Section 19, the requirement that X remit any amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax (without regard to whether there is a payment under the Agreement from which to withhold or deduct such Tax) shall be treated as a requirement to withhold or deduct Tax with respect to a payment under the Agreement.  If at any time, X is required to remit an amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax with respect to the Agreement, then without duplication for any amount that X has deducted on account of such Tax from any amount previously paid to Y pursuant to the Agreement, the amount so required to be remitted shall be payable by Y to X on the date payment is due under Section 871(m) of the Code.  Upon the reasonable request of Y, X will supply to Y computations setting forth in reasonable detail computation of the amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax payable by Y to X pursuant to the preceding sentence.
(d)
 
      Notwithstanding Section 19(a) through (d), the Sellers payment (if any) under Section 5(a)(i) or any return of Purchase Price, Excess Shares or Make-whole Excess Shares (as those terms are defined in the Cover Letter) by the Seller to the Company in connection with a cancellation of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby pursuant to the terms of the Cover Letter will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax other than a Designated Tax.  If any liability resulting from any Tax other than a Designated Tax is assessed directly against the Seller in connection with such payment or return, then, except to the extent the Company has satisfied or then satisfies the liability, the Company will pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest and penalties).  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Seller is required to deduct or withhold any Designated Tax from such payment or return, then this Section 19(e) will not apply and Section 19(a) through (d) will apply.

Re:  
Cover Letter for Accelerated Share Repurchase
Ladies and Gentlemen:
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London Branch (the ) agrees to sell to Janssen Pharmaceutical, a company organized under the laws of Ireland and acting on its own behalf and not as an agent of any other entity (the ), and the Company agrees to purchase from the Seller, for settlement (share delivery) on June 13, 2012 (the ), 101,870,028 shares (the ) of capital stock, par value $1.00 per share (the ), of Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey corporation (the ), at a purchase price equal to $6,425,961,366 (the ) on a free delivery basis.  Delivery of the Initial Shares shall be made at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time (the ), on the Purchase Date, to an account specified by the Company prior to such time, and the Seller shall not deliver any of the Initial Shares to the Company earlier than the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to increase or decrease the number of Initial Shares to not more than 101,870,028 shares (the ) and not less than 101,870,028 shares (the ) by written notice, which may be delivered by electronic mail, to the Seller prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Purchase Date (a ); provided that such Change Notice shall contain a representation and warranty of the Company to the Seller that at the time such notice is delivered, none of the Company and its officers and directors is aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Issuer or the Common Stock.  If the Seller is unable to borrow, on commercially reasonable terms, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice but without reduction as set forth in this sentence) and deliver such shares to the Company on the Purchase Date, then the number of Initial Shares shall be reduced to such number of shares of Common Stock as the Seller is able to so borrow and deliver and the Purchase Price shall be reduced correspondingly (a ).  In addition, if the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice and after giving effect to any Borrow Unavailability Reduction) is less than the Maximum Initial Shares, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock by which the Maximum Initial Shares exceeds such number of Initial Shares and (y) $63.08, and if prior to such reduction a higher Purchase Price had been paid by the Company, then on the Trading Day immediately following the Purchase Date, the Seller shall return to the Company an amount equal to the excess of the higher Purchase Price so paid over the Purchase Price as so reduced, without interest.  The Sellers obligation to deliver the Initial Shares on the Purchase Date is conditioned upon the Companys payment of the Purchase Price at or prior to noon, New York City time, on the Purchase Date.

The Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to so borrow and deliver the Minimum Initial Shares (without giving effect to any Borrow Unavailability Reduction).  For the avoidance doubt, in using such reasonable best efforts, the Seller shall act in good faith and in accordance with its then current policies, practices and procedures (including without limitation any policies, practices or procedures relating to counterparty risk, market risk, reputational risk, credit, documentation, legal, regulatory capital, compliance and collateral), and shall not be required to enter into any securities lending transaction or transact with any potential securities lender if such transaction would not be in accordance with such policies, practices and procedures.  If the number of Initial Shares (as increased or decreased by any Change Notice) exceeds the Minimum Initial Shares, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement (as defined below) to the contrary, the Seller shall not be liable in any way for any inability to borrow any shares in excess of the Minimum Initial Shares, and the only consequence of any such inability shall be a Borrow Unavailability Reduction.  Promptly upon request from the Company prior to the Earliest Delivery Time, the Seller shall orally inform the Company of the Sellers good faith estimate of the minimum number of shares of Common Stock that the Seller will be able to deliver to the Company at or after the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, the giving of any such estimate shall not alter the Sellers obligations in respect of any of the Initial Shares as set forth in the Agreement.
The Seller and the Company agree that time is of the essence with respect to the delivery of the Initial Shares pursuant to the Agreement (as defined below).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Seller shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any third parties, including any transfer agent, custodian, stock lender or clearance system, or of the Issuer, the Company or any affiliate or agent of the Issuer or the Company and (ii) the Seller shall not be liable for any special, consequential or indirect damages resulting from any failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Initial Shares (before any reduction as provided above) when due.  Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller shall have fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement to deliver the Initial Shares if the Seller has deposited the Initial Shares into the Sellers account at Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the ), the further transfer and delivery to the Company of the Initial Shares is not limited in any way by any action or inaction by the Seller or its affiliates and the Seller has instructed the Custodian to transfer the Initial Shares at or after the Earliest Delivery Time on the Purchase Date from such account to the Companys account at the Custodian.
Custodian
The Seller and the Company agree that the sale and purchase of the Initial Shares is subject to the agreements, terms and conditions set forth in the Schedule of Standard Terms and Conditions attached hereto as , which is incorporated by reference herein and is an integral part of this agreement (the  and, together with this Cover Letter for Accelerated Share Repurchase, the ).  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Schedule.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement (including the Schedule), the following shall be conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby: (i) no later than the date hereof, the Seller and the Issuer shall enter into a guarantee agreement substantially in the form set forth in hereto (the ), (ii) the Company shall deliver to the Seller on or prior to the Purchase Date an opinion of counsel to the Company substantially to the effect set forth in the first sentence of Section 12(g) and Section 12(j) of the Schedule, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller, which opinion shall be rendered by nationally recognized outside counsel to the Company, except for the opinion substantially to the effect set forth in the first sentence of Section 12(g) of the Schedule, which may be rendered by internal counsel to the Company, (iii) the Company and the Companys Irish counsel shall have provided to the Seller and the Sellers Irish counsel such information and documents as the Seller shall have reasonably requested to allow the Sellers Irish counsel to deliver to the Seller an opinion substantially to the effect set forth in Sections 12(b), 12(g) and 12(h) of the Schedule with respect to matters of Irish law, and (iv) the Company shall complete, execute and deliver to the Seller on or prior to the Purchase Date a valid and materially accurate and complete United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor thereto).
Annex II
Guarantee
The Company hereby informs the Seller that it intends to enter into a similar letter agreement with a separate financial institution (the ), and that it has structured each letter agreement such that no Relevant Day in such similar letter agreement is a Relevant Day under the Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agreement creates no rights or obligations as between Seller #1 and Seller #2 (each as defined below).
Other Agreement
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at any time (the ) prior to the Averaging Period Start Date, upon prior notice to the Seller.  Any such notice of cancellation shall be delivered to each of the employees of the Seller specified in Schedule I hereto, and not to any other employees or agents of the Seller.  At the time the Company gives any such notice of cancellation, or as soon thereafter as such representation and warranty would be true, the Company shall represent and warrant in writing to the Seller that none of the Company and its officers and directors is aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Issuer or the Common Stock (the ).  If the Cancellation Time occurs prior to the time (the ) at which ownership of the Initial Shares passes to the Company or its agent (the Time of Ownership to be the earliest time determined by either party in good faith upon the advice of counsel), then the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be cancelled and shall terminate without any obligation of any party thereto; provided that (i) if the Purchase Price had been paid prior to the Cancellation Time, the Seller shall promptly return the Purchase Price to the Company; (ii) the Company shall, upon reasonable request of the Seller, assist in the return of any of the Initial Shares to the Seller or to any counterparties to stock loan transactions with the Seller, and (iii) the Company shall pay to the Seller the amount of the Sellers cost to borrow shares of Common Stock (including related funding costs) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company shall not give notice of any such cancellation between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., New York City time, on any Trading Day, unless the Company shall have previously publicly disclosed the fact that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are being cancelled in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and the Seller may deem the filing of any such Form 8-K as notice of a cancellation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement), in which case the Company shall also substantially contemporaneously with such filing, give separate notice of such cancellation to the Seller, and any such notice delivered in violation of this sentence shall not be effective to cancel the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; and (B) if the Company gives notice of any such cancellation at any other time, the Company shall publicly disclose the fact that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are being cancelled in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, following the time at which such notice is given, and the Company acknowledges that failure to timely make such filing could result in significant trading losses by the Seller and its affiliates.

If the Cancellation Time occurs at or after the Time of Ownership, then the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be cancelled and shall terminate in accordance with the following terms:
(i)         The Company shall promptly, and in any event within two scheduled Trading Days of the Cancellation Time (but no earlier than as requested by the Seller), deliver to the Seller a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Initial Shares (the ) and, promptly following such delivery, the Seller shall return the Purchase Price to the Company; provided that such delivery and return is subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule to account for the Close-out Amount (as defined in the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement deemed to be the sole Transaction under such Master Agreement) in respect of such termination.  The Calculation Agent shall notify the parties of the amount of such adjustment, expressed both as a number of shares of Common Stock and as an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, promptly following the Cancellation Time, and the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to elect that such adjustment be effected as an adjustment to the number of Cancellation Shares so delivered by the Company to the Seller or as an adjustment to the amount of cash so returned by the Seller to the Company.  For the avoidance of doubt, in determining such Close-out Amount, the Calculation Agent shall take into account the anticipated entry into the Share Sales Agreement (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Cancellation Shares
(ii)         The Company shall cause the Issuer to promptly, and in any event within two scheduled Trading Days of the Cancellation Time, execute and deliver a Share Sales Agreement, substantially in the form of hereto, with the Seller and the Sellers Broker-Dealer Entity (the ), covering the sale of the Cancellation Shares by the Seller or its affiliate.
Annex V
Share Sales Agreement
(iii)         If the number of Cancellation Shares exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock comprising Sellers net short position in respect of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement at the Cancellation Time (such latter number of shares, the ), then any Cancellation Shares in excess of the Short Position shall be  and the following provisions shall apply.  At the Cancellation Time, a notional balance (the ) shall be established with an initial balance equal to the product of the number of Excess Shares and the per share market value of the Common Stock at the Cancellation Time, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule.  The Seller or its affiliate shall, promptly following delivery of the Cancellation Shares, the execution of the Share Sales Agreement and the availability of the Prospectus (as defined therein) thereunder as provided therein, commence sales of the Excess Shares on Scheduled Relevant Days pursuant to the Share Sales Agreement, and 99% of the net proceeds of such sales shall be applied to reduce the Excess Shares Balance.  If all of the Excess Shares have been sold and the Excess Shares Balance has not been reduced to zero, then the Seller shall so notify the Company and the Company shall, within one scheduled Trading Day of such notice, either (A) pay an amount to the Seller equal to the remaining Excess Shares Balance, or (B) deliver to the Seller a number of additional shares of Common Stock () equal to (x) the remaining Excess Shares Balance divided by (y)(1) the per share market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with Section 11 of the Schedule multiplied by (2) 99%.  The Company may elect either clause (A) or clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence in its sole discretion.  If the Company elects to deliver Make-whole Excess Shares, those Make-whole Excess Shares will be deemed to be Excess Shares pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) and the provisions of this subparagraph (iii) shall apply until the Excess Shares Balance has been reduced to zero (for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of Make-whole Excess Shares shall not increase the Excess Shares Balance).  If at any time the Excess Shares Balance has been reduced to zero and the Seller or its affiliate has so sold fewer than all of Excess Shares and any Make-whole Excess Shares, then the Seller shall promptly return to the Company any Excess Shares or Make-whole Excess Shares remaining unsold at the time the Excess Shares Balance is reduced to zero.  For the avoidance of doubt, sales of the Excess Shares and any Make-whole Excess Shares pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) shall be completed prior to the commencement of sales of the Cancellation Shares that are not Excess Shares pursuant to the Share Sales Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to deliver more than the Maximum Deliverable Number of shares of Common Stock as Make-whole Excess Shares hereunder.

    means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by any government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under the Agreement other than a stamp, registration, documentation or similar tax.
Tax
      Subject to Section 19(e), all payments under the Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant government or taxation authority, then in effect.  If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party () will:
(b)
X
(i)       promptly notify the other party () of such requirement;
Y
(ii)      pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 19) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
(iii)     promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
(iv)     if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under the Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for the failure by Y to:
 
 
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
     deliver to X any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Agreement by the date specified in the Agreement, or if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable; or
(A)
      deliver to X or, in certain cases, to such government or taxation authority as X reasonably directs, upon reasonable demand by X, any other form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow X or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under the Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the party in receipt of such demand is legally entitled to complete, execute and submit such form or document and the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such party), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification as soon as reasonably practicable (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the ).
(B)
Tax Requirements
      If:
(c)
(i)       X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant government or taxation authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 19(b)(iv);
(ii)      X does not so deduct or withhold; and
(iii)     a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X;
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied (including by making a payment to X pursuant to Section 19(d)) or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any Tax Requirement).
      For all purposes of this Section 19, the requirement that X remit any amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax (without regard to whether there is a payment under the Agreement from which to withhold or deduct such Tax) shall be treated as a requirement to withhold or deduct Tax with respect to a payment under the Agreement.  If at any time, X is required to remit an amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax with respect to the Agreement, then without duplication for any amount that X has deducted on account of such Tax from any amount previously paid to Y pursuant to the Agreement, the amount so required to be remitted shall be payable by Y to X on the date payment is due under Section 871(m) of the Code.  Upon the reasonable request of Y, X will supply to Y computations setting forth in reasonable detail computation of the amount of Dividend Equivalent Tax payable by Y to X pursuant to the preceding sentence.
(d)
      Notwithstanding Section 19(a) through (d), the Sellers payment (if any) under Section 5(a)(i) or any return of Purchase Price, Excess Shares or Make-whole Excess Shares (as those terms are defined in the Cover Letter) by the Seller to the Company in connection with a cancellation of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby pursuant to the terms of the Cover Letter will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax other than a Designated Tax.  If any liability resulting from any Tax other than a Designated Tax is assessed directly against the Seller in connection with such payment or return, then, except to the extent the Company has satisfied or then satisfies the liability, the Company will pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest and penalties).  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Seller is required to deduct or withhold any Designated Tax from such payment or return, then this Section 19(e) will not apply and Section 19(a) through (d) will apply.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
New Brunswick, NJ (June 12, 2012)  Johnson & Johnson today announced that it has received U.S. regulatory clearance for its proposed acquisition of Synthes, Inc. This completes all regulatory approvals required to close the transaction. Johnson & Johnson expects to close the transaction with Synthes on June 14, 2012, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions on that date, for a total purchase price of approximately $19.7 billion in cash and stock.
Based on a June 14, 2012 closing date, each outstanding share of Synthes common stock will be converted into the right to receive CHF 55.65 in cash and 1.7170 shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock (subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). The exchange ratio was calculated based on the average of the volume weighted average trading prices of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the effective time of the merger, as converted into CHF on each day during this valuation period (beginning May 30, 2012 and ending, June 12, 2012). Further information regarding closing instructions for Synthes stockholders can be found on or .
www.investor.jnj.com
www.Synthes.com
The European Commission granted its antitrust approval for the transaction on April 19, 2012.   On June 11, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) granted early termination of the requisite waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The FTC also voted to accept a proposed consent order regarding the acquisition, which requires Johnson & Johnson to divest to an FTC-approved buyer certain rights and assets related to its DePuy trauma business.  As previously announced, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, has entered into an agreement to divest its trauma business to Biomet, Inc. The divestiture is expected to close in the second quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company has also commenced several steps to finance the transaction in an efficient manner to enhance shareholder value.  Janssen Pharmaceutical, a wholly owned Irish subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, has entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to purchase a combined total of 203.7 million shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for an initial purchase price of $12.9 billion.  The shares purchased under the ASR agreements, together with cash on hand from Janssen Pharmaceutical, will be used by Janssen Pharmaceutical to provide the merger consideration for the purchase of Synthes.  No third party debt is expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition.  The ASR agreements are subject to terms customary for similar agreements, including adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events under which the ASR agreements may be extended or canceled. Further information regarding the ASR agreements can be found in the Companys related Form 8-K filing.
Under the ASR agreements Janssen Pharmaceutical will purchase shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock that the banks will have borrowed from stock lenders, and during the term of the ASR agreements the banks are expected to purchase approximately $12.9 billion of shares in the open market to return to those stock lenders.
Based on the financial structure indicated above, the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to 2012 adjusted earnings per share* by approximately $0.03 - $0.05.  Johnson & Johnson had previously disclosed in its S-4 filing that the acquisition was anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share by $0.22, based on 2010 financial information.  The current estimate reflects a mid-year 2012 closing date as well as current sales estimates for the combined orthopaedics business.  In addition, Johnson & Johnson expects to record estimated after-tax special items for the balance of 2012 consisting of charges of approximately $1.1 billion related to the acquisition, including restructuring and integration costs, inventory step-up and currency adjustments.   In 2013, the first full year of the combined businesses, the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share* by $0.10 - $0.15.  Additional information on the transaction, including earnings guidance for 2012, will be shared during Johnson & Johnsons next quarterly earnings analyst conference call on July 17, 2012.  Certain risk factors on the financial structure and impact of the transaction, as well as certain updated information with respect to the Swiss tax consequences of the transaction, are discussed in the Note to Investors and Media section below and investors are encouraged to read that information carefully.

About Johnson & Johnson
Caring for the world, one person at a time, inspires and unites the people of Johnson & Johnson. We embrace research and science - bringing innovative ideas, products and services to advance the health and well-being of people. Our approximately 117,000 employees at more
than 250 Johnson & Johnson operating companies work with partners in health care to touch the lives of over a billion people every day, throughout the world.
* Adjusted earnings per share excludes special items such as inventory step-up, restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction. Adjusted earnings per share  is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results.
Given the pending transactions, the Company will not be commenting beyond this news release and the related Form 8-K filing until after the transaction closes, which is expected to occur on June 14, 2012.
The anticipated financial effect of the transactions as set forth above assumes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions are consummated on their terms and in accordance with applicable law. The transactions are intended to efficiently combine the respective businesses of Synthes and DePuy, a family of companies within Johnson & Johnson providing healthcare solutions in orthopaedics, spinal care, sports medicine and neurosciences.
 
While Johnson & Johnson believes that these transactions will allow it to effectuate the acquisition in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to Johnson & Johnson, plus interest.
As previously disclosed, Swiss-resident individual taxpayers holding Synthes shares as their private property should realize a tax-free private capital gain or a non-tax-deductible loss, as the case may be, with respect to all or part of the merger consideration, but a portion of the merger consideration might be treated as dividend income.  This will depend on the structure used to finance the acquisition.  Based on the current financing structure and current exchange rates, we expect that no such portion of the merger consideration should be treated as dividend income for those Swiss-resident taxpayers.  In addition, according to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the transaction is, unless a personal exemption applies to the individual stockholder, subject to Swiss securities transfer tax, which will be deducted from the merger consideration by the custodian banks.

Synthes stockholders should consult with their individual tax advisors to determine the tax consequences of the acquisition in light of their particular circumstances, including what tax planning opportunities might be available to them.
(This communication contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson & Johnson and Synthes.  Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the satisfaction of closing conditions for the acquisition and the possibility that the transaction will not be completed, or if completed, will not be completed in the expected timeframe; the impact of changes in the market value of Johnson & Johnsons common stock on the price of the shares repurchased under the ASR agreements; the ability of Johnson & Johnson to effectuate the acquisition of Synthes in a tax efficient manner; whether anticipated accretion to earnings per share in future periods will be achieved; general industry conditions and competition; economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approvals; challenges to patents; significant adverse litigation; impact of business combinations; financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant customers and suppliers; changes to governmental laws and regulations and domestic and foreign health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; changes in behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; disruptions due to natural disasters; manufacturing difficulties or delays; and product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action. In addition, if and when the transaction is consummated, there will be risks and uncertainties related to Johnson & Johnsons ability to successfully integrate the businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Synthes, as well as the ability to ensure continued performance or market growth of Synthes products. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors and the general risks associated with the respective businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Synthes can be found in Exhibit 99 of Johnson & Johnsons Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012, and Synthes 2011 Audited Financial Statements. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com, www.synthes.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson or Synthes. Neither Johnson & Johnson nor Synthes undertakes to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.)
