Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
         On July 1, 2002, Juniper Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), completed its acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Unisphere"), a privately held provider of data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks (the "Acquisition"). In the Acquisition, Homer Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into Unisphere such that Unisphere became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company after the Acquisition. In exchange for their shares of Unisphere, the former shareholders of Unisphere received an aggregate of 36,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company and cash totaling $375 million. The cash portion of the consideration was paid from the Company's operating cash. Immediately prior to the Acquisition, Siemens Corporation owned approximately 98.4% of the outstanding capital stock of Unisphere.
         The shares of the Company's common stock were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in reliance on Section 3(a)(10) thereof.
         The Company's press release dated July 2, 2002 announcing the completion of the Acquisition is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.

UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) (1) NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Unisphere Networks, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on January 12, 1999 as Unisphere Solutions, Inc. and is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG. The Company changed its name from Unisphere Solutions, Inc. to Unisphere Networks, Inc. in September 2000. The Company develops, markets and supports data and voice networking products for the delivery of integrated voice and high speed data services to businesses and residential users. In March 1999, Siemens purchased Argon Networks, Inc. ("Argon"). In April 1999, Siemens purchased Castle Networks, Inc. ("Castle") and Redstone Communications, Inc. ("Redstone"). All three companies were development-stage companies engaged in research and development of next generation products for the networking industry. In April 1999, Siemens contributed a research and development group for voice switching products to the Company as an equity contribution (net assets were equal to zero). In June 1999, Siemens contributed the stock of Argon, Castle and Redstone to the Company. In accordance with AICPA Interpretation AIN-APB 16, #39, Transfers and Exchanges Between Companies Under Common Control, the assets and liabilities of the businesses contributed to Unisphere were recorded at historical cost. The results of operations of Argon, Castle and Redstone are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the respective dates of acquisition. The Company considers Redstone and Castle to be the predecessor business as these two businesses represent the primary ongoing business operations of the Company (See Note 14). The Company is subject to risks common to technology-based companies including, but not limited to, the development of new technology, development of markets and distribution channels, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed to meet its product plans. The Company has a limited operating history and has never achieved profitability. To date the Company has been funded by Siemens. On April 30, 2002, the Company sold its Voice product line ("Voice") to Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc. ("Siemens ICN") pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement"), between the Company and Siemens ICN, as of the effective date ("Effective Date") of April 1, 2002. In connection with the sale of Voice, Siemens ICN paid $210 million to the Company's stockholders of record as of May 20, 2002. The net assets and liabilities of Voice were transferred to Siemens ICN at historical cost in accordance with AICPA Interpretation AIN-APB 16, #39, Transfers and Exchanges Between Companies Under Common Control. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Voice as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 14. (2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described below.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (a) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Unisphere Networks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION The interim consolidated financial data as of March 31, 2002 and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. (c) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. (d) INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value). (e) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method, based upon the following asset lives:
Computer and telecommunications equipment 2 to 3 years Furniture and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life of asset
The cost of significant additions and improvements is capitalized and depreciated while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of the assets are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the determination of net income or loss.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (f) INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets include goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over five years and other intangible assets were amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. The Company has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Accordingly, the Company reclassified the workforce intangible asset to goodwill and ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on October 1, 2001. (g) IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets, including goodwill prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, are reviewed continually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful life. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of goodwill to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the business to which the goodwill relates. If such assets or goodwill are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets or goodwill exceeds the related fair value. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounted estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, management of the Company cancelled Argon's original development effort of its gigabit switch router, which was the primary focus of Argon. The cancellation of the project was due to continuing technology problems, major delays and insufficient technical features for the competitive marketplace. The cancellation of this development effort included discarding and abandoning all software development and substantially all hardware components. As a result of the cancellation of the Argon gigabit switch router, the Company performed an impairment review of the goodwill generated from the Argon acquisition. At the time this impairment review was performed, it was determined that there would be no future cash flows generated from the Argon development concept. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $118,495 for the writedown of the remaining unamortized value of the Argon goodwill during the year ended September 30, 2000. The Company also performed an impairment review of the workforce intangible asset generated from the Argon acquisition. At the time this impairment review was performed, it was determined that there was a partial impairment of this asset, based on the higher than expected level of employee turnover experienced to date. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $315 for the writedown of a portion of the unamortized value of the Argon workforce intangible asset during the year ended September 30, 2000.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (h) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and the convertible promissory note approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. (i) REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is deemed probable. If uncertainties exist, revenue is recognized when such uncertainties are resolved. A significant portion of the Company's sales are made through value-added resellers, including various Siemens sales entities. Under these arrangements, value-added resellers do not have a right of return and they purchase products from the Company after they have secured a sale to an end-user. Revenue from professional services is recognized when the services are completed. Revenue from technical support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements. A provision for sales returns and allowances is recorded at the time of revenue recognition based on estimated future returns and allowances. In addition, the Company records a warranty liability for parts and labor on its products at the time of revenue recognition. Warranty periods are generally one year from installation date. (j) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS The Company's products are highly technical in nature and require a large and continuing research and development effort. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to expense. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Amortization is based on the straight-line method over the remaining estimated life of the product. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of the related products has been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have not been material. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. (k) ADVERTISING COSTS The Company expenses advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising costs for the period ended September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 were $736, $7,482 and $2,495, respectively. (l) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) consists of interest income, interest expense and other expenses. The Company recorded $0, $2,164 and $4,985 of losses on disposal of property and equipment for the period ended September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (m) INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company does not file separate income tax returns, but rather is included in the consolidated income tax returns of its parent, Siemens Corporation, a majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG. The Company has entered into a tax sharing agreement with Siemens Corporation. Under this agreement, the Company will reimburse Siemens Corporation for the Company's federal and state income tax liability computed as if its tax returns were filed on a stand alone basis. The Company may use the tax benefits of net operating losses and credits generated by the Company solely to reduce its liability to Siemens Corporation. Siemens Corporation is not obligated to reimburse the Company for any tax benefits in excess of the aggregate liability to Siemens Corporation up to the date of an initial public offering ("IPO") of the Company's stock. Subsequent to the date of an IPO, Siemens Corporation will reimburse the Company for any tax attributes utilized by Siemens Corporation when the Company could have used them on a separate return basis. The Company is obligated to pay Siemens Corporation for any adjustment made by a taxing authority in a consolidated tax year, the benefit of which is subsequently realized by the Company in a non-consolidated tax year. (n) NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of unrestricted common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, if dilutive. Common equivalent shares are composed of restricted common shares and incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options. There were no dilutive common equivalent shares for the period ended September 30, 1999, the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 and the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. At September 30, 2000 and 2001, options to purchase 14,139 and 19,726 shares of common stock, respectively, at an average exercise price of $9.64 and $10.20 per share, respectively, and restricted common shares of 2,741 and 1,552, respectively, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (o) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) Employees," ("APB No. 25") and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). The Company amortizes deferred stock-based employee compensation expense for fixed awards using the straight-line method over the respective employees' vesting periods. (p) SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which requires companies to report selected information about operating segments, as well as enterprise-wide disclosures about products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company has determined that it conducts its operations in one business segment. (q) CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and receivables. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in deposits with commercial banks. (r) RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain components and parts used in the Company's products are procured from a single source. The Company obtains some of its parts from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers. These purchases are made on a purchase order basis. In addition, the majority of the Company's products are manufactured by a single contract manufacturer. The failure of a supplier or the contract manufacturer to deliver on schedule could delay or interrupt the Company's delivery of products and thereby adversely affect the Company's revenue and results of operations. The Company is subject to the rapid technological change inherent in the networking industry. This change includes new product introduction, changes in customer requirements and new technologies. The Company works closely with its customers to understand its customers and the industry requirements. A delay in product and feature introductions could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (3) ACQUISITIONS On April 27, 1999, Siemens purchased Redstone. Under the terms of the Agreement, Siemens purchased all outstanding securities of Redstone for $450,000 in cash. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. In conjunction with the acquisition, Siemens entered into a Milestone Incentive Compensation Plan whereby if certain performance criteria and development milestones were achieved, Siemens would compensate the employees of Redstone with cash incentives. In June 1999, Siemens contributed the stock of Redstone to the Company, which has accounted for the acquisition and Redstone's results of operations from the date of acquisition, as if the Company had effectively acquired Redstone. During the period ended September 30, 1999 and the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company expensed $35,000 and $15,000, respectively, related to the Milestone Incentive Compensation Plan for milestones which had been achieved as of those dates. No additional milestone payments remained as of September 30, 2000. On April 20, 1999, Siemens acquired Castle. Under the terms of the Agreement, Siemens purchased all outstanding securities of Castle for $300,000 in cash. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. In June 1999, Siemens contributed the stock of Castle to the Company, which has accounted for the acquisition and Castle's results of operations from the date of acquisition, as if the Company had effectively acquired Castle. On March 12, 1999, Siemens acquired Argon. Under the terms of the Agreement, Siemens purchased all outstanding securities of Argon for $200,000 in cash. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. In conjunction with the acquisition, Siemens entered into a Milestone Incentive Compensation Plan whereby if certain performance criteria and development milestones were achieved, Siemens would compensate the employees of Argon with cash incentives. In June 1999, Siemens contributed the stock of Argon to the Company, which has accounted for the acquisition and Argon's results of operations from the date of acquisition, as if the Company had effectively acquired Argon. No development milestones had been achieved during the period ended September 30, 1999, therefore no costs were accrued. At the time of acquisition, Siemens also initiated a retention bonus plan, for which the Company expensed $2,140 and $11,133 of cost related to time-based payments in the period ended September 30, 1999 and the year ended September 30, 2000, respectively. No additional retention bonus plan payments remained as of September 30, 2000. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and development was determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition, because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

(An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) Summary of purchase transactions: All payments related to the milestone incentive compensation plans and retention plan were recorded as expense in the consolidated financial statements of Unisphere in the periods following the acquisitions. The expense was recorded as the milestones were achieved for the milestone plans and ratably over the retention period for the retention plan. For the period from January 12, 1999 (date of inception) to September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, aggregate expense of $37,140, $26,133 and $0, respectively, was recorded as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:

In November 2001, the Company issued a second amended and restated convertible promissory to Siemens, pursuant to which the principal amount was increased to $147,000. Siemens has advanced $67,000 and $107,000 to the Company as of September 30, 2001 and March 31, 2002, respectively. The note accrues interest at 7.25% per year. The Company has recorded $3,476 and $3,154 of accrued interest for the year ended September 30, 2001 and the six months ended March 31, 2002. The principal and accrued interest is due or will convert into shares of the Company's common stock at the earlier of November 16, 2002 or the closing of an initial public offering of the Company's common stock. The Company's obligations under the note may be accelerated if an event of default occurs under the note. The number of shares to be issued upon such conversion is equal to the sum of the principal amount of the note plus accrued interest divided by the Company's per share initial public offering price. Upon the

(8) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has been funded since inception by Siemens. The funding was provided based on the Company's operating needs and was accounted for as a capital contribution through November 11, 2000. Total capital contributions from Siemens includes the contribution of the stock of Argon, Castle and Redstone, valued at $950,000, and capital contributions to fund operations of $49,951, $212,503 and $22,250 for the period ended September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Subsequent to November 11, 2000, Siemens has provided funding to the Company in the form of a convertible promissory note (see Note 5). The Company has transactions in the normal course of business with Siemens group companies. Balances resulting from these transactions are reflected on the balance sheet as accounts receivable from related parties and accounts payable to related parties. Transactions included in the statement of operations for the period ended September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 are as follows:

(An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (9) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (a) COMMON STOCK The Company has authorized 115,361 shares of common stock, $.01 par value, of which 86,133, 90,285 and 90,639 shares were outstanding at September 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held. On April 21, 2000, the Board of Directors approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split. The accompanying financial statements reflect the effects of this reverse split for all periods presented. In April 2001, the Board of Directors increased the authorized common stock to 115,361 shares and increased the common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan to 29,227 shares. (b) NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICERS In connection with the sale of restricted stock and in accordance with the original terms of the awards, the Company accepted promissory notes from two officers in the amounts of $26,225 and $2,098, respectively, in August 2000. The notes are secured by the purchased shares and have recourse to the general assets of the officers with respect to 25% of the principal balance and 100% of the accrued interest on the notes. Interest paid is not refundable to the officers. The notes mature in January 2004 and bear interest at the six-month LIBOR index rate plus fifty basis points per annum (4.1% at September 30, 2001). In connection with the exercise of 67 stock options to purchase common stock and in accordance with the original terms of the award, the Company accepted a promissory note from one officer in the amount of $490 in December 2000. The note is secured by the purchased shares and has recourse to the general assets of the officer with respect to 25% of the principal balance and 100% of the accrued interest on the note. Interest paid is not refundable to the officer. In June 2001, the officer repaid the principal and interest on the note. In connection with the termination of one officer in July 2001, the Company repurchased 138 shares of restricted common stock and cancelled $1,444 of the balance of the promissory note. As of September 30, 2001, $138 of accrued interest is recorded in other current assets.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) (10) INCOME TAXES The Company prepared its tax provision as if it filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis. No current provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded as the Company has incurred net operating losses since inception. The following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate: At September 30, 2000 and 2001, the Company had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from current operations and from its acquisitions of Redstone, Castle and Argon. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as well as the net deferred tax assets since management believes that, after considering all the available objective evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. No deferred income tax provision has been recorded because of the valuation allowance. Temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:

(An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) The Company has no federal and $370,107 of state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2001. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire from 2002 through 2005. In addition, the Company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,070 and $6,176, respectively, as of September 30, 2001 which will expire from 2011 through 2018. The utilization of the net operating losses may be limited pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of prior and future ownership changes. In addition, to the extent these net operating losses can be utilized by Siemens Corporation, the Company is not entitled to any reimbursement under the existing tax sharing arrangement and the Company will not receive any current or future income tax benefit related to these net operating losses. (11) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In July 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to acquire common stock to employees, advisors and consultants of the Company. Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory (i.e., nonqualified) stock options. Incentive stock options ("ISO") may be granted only to Company employees (including officers and directors who are also employees). Nonqualified stock options ("NSO") may be granted to Company employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants. The Company reserved 29,227 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan as of September 30, 2001 and March 31, 2002. Options under the Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years and at prices to be determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that (i) the exercise price of an ISO shall not be less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, and (ii) the exercise price of an ISO granted to a 10% shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years. A restricted stock award provides for the issuance of common stock to directors, officers, consultants and other key personnel at prices determined by the Board of Directors or a Committee selected by the Board of Directors. Participants' unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the original sale price. Generally, vesting occurs over a three to four year period. As of September 30, 2001 and March 31, 2002, the Company had the right to repurchase up to 1,552 and 1,070 unvested shares at the original sale price of $10.50 per share.
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) The following table presents activity under the Plan for the period from January 12, 1999 (date of inception) to September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001: The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2001: The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in the period ended September 30, 1999 and the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 was $0.00, $4.85, and $7.71, respectively. The weighted average modification date fair value of stock options modified in April 2000, as discussed below, was $3.62. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for the awards under a method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company's loss from continuing operations would have been $256,576, $336,568 and $129,551 and basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations would have been $2.98, $3.90 and $1.46 for the period ended September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company calculated the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company issued 176 non-qualified stock options to non-employees for services rendered and has valued these stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company used a volatility factor of 65%, a risk free interest rate of 6.03%, a dividend rate of zero and the contractual lives of the grants, which ranged from one to ten years. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company issued 54 non-qualified stock options to non-employees for services rendered and has valued these stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company used a volatility factor of 65%, a risk free interest rate of 6.00%, a dividend rate of zero and the contractual lives of the grants of ten years. The Company had 176 and 230 non-qualified stock options outstanding to non-employees at September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company has fully amortized the deferred compensation expense of $630 and $167 during the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company sold 3,221 shares of restricted common stock and granted 4,530 stock options to purchase common stock at amounts lower than the estimated fair market value. Accordingly, the Company has recorded deferred compensation related to the restricted common stock and common stock options that were sold or issued at amounts less than estimated fair market value. During fiscal 2000, the Company recorded $48,045 in deferred compensation related to restricted common stock and stock options issued to employees of the Company. In addition, the Company recorded compensation expense of $9,308 and $677 in continuing and discontinued operations, respectively, in fiscal 2000 and $12,680 and $535 in continuing and discontinued operations, respectively, in fiscal 2001, related to the amortization of deferred compensation over the vesting period. In April 2000, the Company changed the exercise price of 2,344 employee stock options to purchase common stock. At September 30, 2000, stock options for the purchase of 370 shares of common stock had been exercised and 146 stock options had been cancelled. At September 30, 2001, stock options for the purchase of 532 shares of common stock had been exercised and 345 stock options had been cancelled. The remaining 1,467 stock options will become exercisable over a four-year period. During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded $22,654 in deferred compensation and $8,887 and $2,962 of non-cash expense in continuing and discontinued operations, respectively, related to these stock options. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company recorded a $15,741 decrease in deferred compensation and $4,496 and $1,449 of non-cash income in continuing and discontinued operations, respectively, related to these stock options due to a decrease in the fair market value of the Company's common stock. Deferred compensation amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the
UNISPHERE NETWORKS, INC. (An indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (information as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 is unaudited) applicable stock options. The Company cannot estimate the effect of stock-based compensation related to employee stock options for which the exercise price was changed since determination of variable stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock in future periods. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company recorded $1,092 of deferred compensation related to the acceleration of vesting on 311 stock options to employees upon termination from the Company. The Company has fully amortized the deferred compensation of $1,092 into expense during the year ended September 30, 2001. (12) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN The Company sponsors several defined contribution plans covering substantially all of its employees which are designed to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) plans through payroll deductions within statutory and plan limits. The Company recorded expense of $13, $0 and $0, related to the plans in the period from January 12, 1999 (date of inception) to September 30, 1999 and for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. (13) GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS The Company operates in a single industry segment encompassing the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and technical support of networking products and services. In the period ended September 30, 1999, the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 and the six months ended March 31, 2002, Siemens accounted for approximately 79.9%, 64.4%, 44.8% and 37.3%, respectively, of net revenues. In addition, the Company had two customers who accounted for 28.6% and 19.3% of net revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000.

Exhibit 99.2 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information gives effect to the acquisition of Unisphere Networks ("Unisphere") by Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper Networks"). The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141). Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimates of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Unisphere have been combined with the recorded values of the assets and liabilities of Juniper Networks in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information. The purchase price allocation for Unisphere is preliminary and unaudited. These allocations are subject to change pending the completion of an analysis of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The impact of such changes could be material. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2002 gives effect to the Unisphere acquisition as if it occurred on March 31, 2002. The Juniper Networks consolidated balance sheet information included therein was derived from its unaudited March 31, 2002 condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Unisphere consolidated balance sheet information included therein was derived from its unaudited March 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations give pro forma effect to the acquisition as if the transaction was consummated on January 1, 2001. The information included in the 2001 unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations includes the condensed consolidated statement of operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the condensed consolidated statement of operations of Unisphere for the year ended September 30, 2001, which were derived from their respective audited consolidated statements of operations for such years. The information included in the unaudited condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2002 was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations of Juniper Networks and Unisphere for this three-month period. Unisphere's revenues and net loss for the three-month period ended December 31, 2001, which are not presented in the aforementioned unaudited condensed combined consolidated statements of operations, were $60.3 million and $14.2 million, respectively. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information has been prepared by Company management for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had Juniper Networks and Unisphere been a combined company during the specified periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on the information available at the time of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information, including the notes thereto, is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements of Juniper Networks included in its Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed April 1, 2001 and May 15, 2002, respectively, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the historical consolidated financial statements of Unisphere included as exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information.
JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED 2001 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information.
JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2002 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) See accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BASIS OF PRESENTATION Juniper Networks acquired Unisphere on July 1, 2002 for a total purchase price of approximately $901.3 million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. Juniper Networks exchanged approximately $375 million of cash and 36.5 million shares of Juniper Networks common stock with a fair value of approximately $359.9 million for all of the outstanding stock of Unisphere. The common stock was valued using Juniper Networks' average closing stock price on the 2 days before and after the transaction was announced, which was $9.86 per share. Juniper Networks also assumed all of the outstanding stock options of Unisphere with a fair value of approximately $151.2 million. The options were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 0.8 for volatility, 2 years for expected life, 4% for the risk-free interest rate and a market value of $9.86 per share as described above. The estimated aggregate purchase price of $901.3 million includes an estimate of the direct costs associated with this transaction aggregating approximately $9.7 million and an estimated liability of approximately $5.5 million associated with the estimated costs of terminating certain employees of Unisphere and other exit activities. During the quarter ending September 30, 2002 Juniper Networks expects to incur additional costs for severance (related to its employees whose positions were eliminated) and other exit costs (related to facilities which will be closed) as a result of the acquisition of Unisphere. These amounts have not been finalized at this time. The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Preliminary estimates based on management's best estimates of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Unisphere have been combined with the recorded values of the assets and liabilities of Juniper Networks in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. This allocation is subject to change pending completion of an analysis of the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The impact of such changes could be material. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS (1) To reflect the issuance of approximately $375.0 million in cash and 36.5 million shares of Juniper Networks Common Stock and the assumption of all outstanding options in conjunction with the Unisphere acquisition, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $901.3 million, including approximately $15.2 million of estimated transaction and exit costs. (2) To reflect the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the Unisphere acquisition. The purchase price allocation is based on management's preliminary estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets, as well as acquired technology, certain of which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The purchased technology, service contract relationships and non-compete agreements will be amortized on a straight-line basis over two to six years. The backlog valuation, as depicted below, and inventory fair value mark-up of approximately $1.5 million, which is included in the fair value of net tangible assets acquired, will be charged to costs of goods sold over the period they are consumed, which is expected to be within the next six months. Deferred compensation on unvested stock options will be amortized over the vesting period using the graded vesting method. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", the goodwill will not be amortized. The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price paid for the acquisition is summarized as follows (in thousands):
Fair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 39,897 In-process research and development 82,900 Purchased technology 61,500 Service contract relationships 6,900 Non-compete agreements 2,400 Order backlog 3,600 Goodwill 703,591 Deferred compensation on unvested stock options 499 --------- Total $ 901,287 =========
(3) To reflect the elimination of the stockholders' equity accounts (including deferred stock compensation and accumulated other comprehensive loss), discontinued operation accounts (which were not purchased by Juniper Networks), goodwill and amortization of goodwill of Unisphere. In addition, the convertible promissory notes and notes receivable from officers were eliminated because the convertible promissory notes converted to 12,657 shares of Unisphere common stock prior to the acquisition and the notes receivable from officers were forgiven by Unisphere's former parent company prior to the acquisition of Unisphere by Juniper Networks. There were no transactions between Juniper Networks and Unisphere during the periods presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements. (4) Juniper Networks will record an immediate write-off of in-process research and development at the consummation of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include the charge for in-process research and development of approximately $82.9 million since it is considered a non-recurring charge. The charge will be recorded by Juniper Networks in the three months ended September 30, 2002. (5) To reflect the effect on interest income for approximately $375 million of cash paid by Juniper Networks. PRO FORMA NET LOSS PER SHARE The unaudited pro forma combined basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock of Juniper Networks during the periods presented, plus the number of vested shares issued to consummate the acquisition of Unisphere as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined diluted net loss per share is the same as the unaudited pro forma combined basic net loss per share as all common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive due to the loss position. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain amounts in Unisphere's historical condensed financial information have been reclassified to conform to Juniper Networks' historical financial statement presentation.
