Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 10, 2003, Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper Networks") is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Juniper Networks is making forward-looking statements regarding 2003 during the conference call and is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
     To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Juniper Networks uses non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expense and income items. These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expense and income items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. In addition, since we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
