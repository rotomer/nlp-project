Exhibit 10.1
Summary of Compensatory Plans and Arrangements Adopted February 8, 2006
On February 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") met and (i) adopted the Company's 2006 Bonus Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the "Plan"); (ii) approved a restricted stock unit program for Executive Officers; and (iii) approved certain bonus payments to 2005 executive officers under the 2005 executive officer bonus plan.
(i) . The participants in the Plan are divided into two categories as follows:
2006 Executive Officer Bonus Plan
The payment of bonuses under the Plan for corporate participants is based on performance against six month Company revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets. The payment of bonuses under the Plan for business team participants is based on performance against six month Company revenue targets and business team revenue and contribution margin targets. Corporate participant bonuses are based 100% on overall Company performance. Business team participant bonuses are based 50% on overall Company performance and 50% on the performance of their respective business team. Payments under the plan are calculated and paid after each six month measurement period.
The target bonus of Mr. Kriens is 150% of base salary. The target bonus for each other participant is 100% of base salary.
For each of the participants, a specified minimum achievement against all target metrics is required for any payment of bonuses. Overachievement of the target metrics can result in payment of bonuses in excess of the target bonus (up to a maximum of 200% of target bonus).
The final bonus for each participant, calculated as described above, is subject to adjustment based upon the company's revenue performance compared to industry peers and individually set performance goals.
(ii) . The Compensation Committee approved a restricted stock performance program pursuant to which Executive Officers will be awarded a number of restricted stock units based on the achievement of earnings per share objectives for 2006. Depending on the performance against the objectives, participants could be granted restricted stock units for as much as 150% of the target number of restricted stock units or as few as 25% of the target number of restricted stock units. Once the restricted stock units are granted they will vest over a multiple year period following the grant date. The target number of restricted stock units for the executive officers is as follows: 100,000 for Mr. Kriens; 50,000 for Mr. Minshull; 33,000 for each of Mr. Dykes, Mr. Sindhu and Mr. Sturgeon; and 25,000 for Ms. Perdikou.
