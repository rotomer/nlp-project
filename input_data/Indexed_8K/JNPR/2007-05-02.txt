Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 30, 2007 and May 1, 2007, Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") amended certain unexercised stock options held by Mr. Robert Sturgeon and Ms. Kim Perdikou, respectively, that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the Companys common stock on the options date of grant, as determined by the Company for financial accounting purposes. The amendments increased the exercise price for the unexercised portion of these affected options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the date of grant. The purpose of these amendments is to avoid unfavorable tax consequences for the option holders under United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A") which would result upon the vesting of options that have an exercise price that is less than fair market value of the underlying common stock on the options date of grant. All options covered by these amendments were granted to Mr. Sturgeon and Ms. Perdikou prior to the dates upon which they were promoted to their roles as Section 16 executive officers of the Company. In exchange for the executives agreeing to the increase in the exercise price of these options, the Company will make a cash payment to Mr. Sturgeon and Ms. Perdikou in an amount equal to the incremental per share exercise price increase multiplied by the corresponding number of shares subject to the affected options. In order to satisfy the provisions of Section 409A, these payments will be made in January 2008. The form of option amendment agreement entered into by the Company and Mr. Sturgeon is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and the form of option amendment agreement entered into by the Company and Ms. Perdikou is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.2.
