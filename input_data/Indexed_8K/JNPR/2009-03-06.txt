Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On March 2, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") approved a new compensation arrangement for Scott Kriens, the Chairman of the Board and an employee of the Company, to reflect the change in his responsibilities from Chief Executive Officer to Chairman. Under this new arrangement, Mr. Kriens annual base salary will be reduced to $400,000, effective April 1, 2009, and he will not be eligible to participate under the Companys cash incentive compensation programs. In addition, effective April 1, 2009, Mr. Kriens will be granted a one year performance share award. This grant will be subject to the same performance vesting conditions as the CEOs performance share award for 2009 (such that Mr. Kriens could receive up to 200% of the target shares based on the performance attained), except that the earned portion will vest one year from the effective date of grant. The Committee also adopted a new policy that supersedes the Companys Aircraft Reimbursement Policy for Mr. Kriens. Under the new policy, if Mr. Kriens uses his personal aircraft for business travel on behalf of the Company, he will be entitled to be reimbursed for his travel at rates equal to first class airfare to the applicable destination.
