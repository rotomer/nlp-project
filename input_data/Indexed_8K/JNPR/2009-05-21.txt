Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 21, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the following policy: It is the policy of the Compensation Committee that in unusual circumstances where the Committee believes that accommodations have to be made to recruit a new executive officer to the Company, limited reimbursement for excise taxes payable may be included in the executive officers contracts. In those circumstances, the excise tax "gross ups" will be limited to payments triggered by both a change in control and termination of employment and will be subject to a three-year sunset provision.
