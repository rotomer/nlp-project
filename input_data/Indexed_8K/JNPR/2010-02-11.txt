Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company" or "Juniper") today announced that it has agreed in principle to settle the securities class action litigations pending against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, contingent upon approval by the Boards of Trustees of the Lead Plaintiffs in those actions. The class actions were brought on behalf of persons and entities who bought or acquired the publicly traded securities of the Company from July 11, 2003 through August 10, 2006. The litigation arose from events that occurred several years ago relating to the granting of stock options to employees generally. Those practices have long been eliminated and new controls put in place. Juniper is pleased to put this longstanding matter behind it. Under the proposed settlement, the claims against the Company and its officers and directors will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $169 million cash payment by the Company. In accordance with U.S. generall y accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company will record the cash settlement amount as a pre-tax charge in its GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009. In its previous announcement of preliminary fourth quarter 2009 financial results on January 28, 2010, the Company reported GAAP net income of $131 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. The Company expects that this one-time charge will reduce previously reported GAAP net income by approximately $108 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009. This settlement will not affect the Companys previously reported non-GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009. These effects will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements contained in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2009 which is expected to be filed on or before March 1, 2010. The proposed settlement remains su bject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including negotiation and execution of a final stipulation of settlement and approval by the court following notice to members of the class.
