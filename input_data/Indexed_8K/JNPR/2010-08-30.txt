(e) On August 24, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") completed a periodic review of change of control severance agreements. As part of the review, the Committee approved updates to existing change of control severance agreements for certain officers of the Company, including Robyn Denholm, John Morris, Michael Rose and Pradeep Sindhu. The total number of officers approved for change of control agreements was also reduced by the Committee. The updated form of agreement will replace the existing change of control severance agreements for the approved officers, which existing agreements are due to expire on January 1, 2011. The updated agreements reflect no material changes to the benefits payable under the existing change of control agreements and will expire on January 1, 2014.
