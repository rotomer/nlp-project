Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 2, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") approved a compensation arrangement for Scott Kriens, the Chairman of the Board to reflect the change in his responsibilities from Chief Executive Officer to an employee Chairman. On February 9, 2011, the Committee adopted a new compensation arrangement for Mr. Kriens. Mr. Kriens will remain an employee through April 1, 2011. After such date, he will become a non-employee Chairman of the Board. In addition to the standard annual directors fee of $55,000, Mr. Kriens will receive an annual Chairman fee of $75,000. He will also be entitled to receive the standard annual RSU grant to non-employee directors that is made on the date of the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders, prorated based on the date he becomes a non-employee director. The transition from employee to non-employee will result in the expiration of Mr. Kriens existing employee stock options e ither 30 days or 90 days after April 1, 2011 depending on the applicable grant. Because that expiration period would occur in part during the Companys standard quarterly trading blackout for executive officers and directors (which begins March 1, 2011 and is scheduled to end on the third trading day after the Company releases its financial results for its first fiscal quarter), Mr. Kriens has indicated that he expects to exercise and sell those options during February 2011. Aside from these stock options, Mr. Kriens continues to beneficially hold 8,678,177 shares of Common Stock as of the date of this filing.
