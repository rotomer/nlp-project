Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On August 25, 2011, the Board of Directors approved effective on September 1, 2011 an amendment of Section 3.7 of the Bylaws to simplify the method of giving notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors. The amendment enables notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors to be given by electronic mail or courier and reduces the period of prior notice from 48 hours to 24 hours. As amended, Section 3.7 reads in its entirety as follows: 3.7 SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two directors. Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be (i) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone to each director, (ii) sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, (iii) sent by facsimile; or (iv) sent by electronic mail, directed to each director at that directors address, telephone number, facsimile number or electronic mail address, as the case may be, as it is shown on the records of the Corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is (i) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone, (ii) sent by facsimile or (iii) sent by electronic mail, it shall be delivered or sent at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice may be communicated to the director. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation, or the purpose of the meeting.
