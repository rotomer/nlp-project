Computation of Interest.
     It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with all applicable usury laws, whether now existing or hereafter enacted. Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other document evidencing, securing, guaranteeing or otherwise pertaining to the Obligations of Borrower to the Lenders, in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness of Borrower to the Lenders or otherwise, shall the interest contracted for, charged or received by the Lenders exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law. If from any circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any provisions of this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or of any other document evidencing, securing, guaranteeing or otherwise pertaining to the Obligations of Borrower to the Lenders, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any such circumstances the Lenders shall ever receive anything of value as interest or deemed interest by applicable law under this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other document evidencing, securing, guaranteeing or otherwise pertaining to the Obligations of Borrower to the Lenders or otherwise an amount that would exceed the highest lawful amount (the ""), such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing in connection with this Agreement or on account of any other indebtedness of Borrower to the Lenders, and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal owing in connection with this Agreement and such other indebtedness, such excess shall be refunded to Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable with respect to indebtedness of Borrower to the Lenders, under any specific contingency, exceeds the maximum nonusurious rate permitted under applicable law, the Lenders may, at their option (a) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total amount of interest throughout the full term of such indebtedness so that the actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, and/or (d) allocate interest between portions of the Obligations, to the end that no such portion shall bear interest at a rate greater than that permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any Obligations is calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable on such Obligations shall remain at the Maximum Rate until each Lender shall have received the amount of interest which such Lender would have received during such period on such Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period.

        Loan Documents and notices under the Loan Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile.

     All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.
A.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrower set forth in subsections 2.6D, 2.7, 3.5A, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.17 and 10.18 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in subsections 9.2C, 9.4, 10.5, 10.18 and 10.19 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of this Agreement.
B.
10.10    Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
        No failure or delay on the part of an Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.
10.11    Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.
        Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that Borrower makes a payment or payments to Agent or Lenders (or to Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
10.12    Severability.
        In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
10.13    Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights.
        The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders, or Lenders and Borrower, as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.
10.14     Headings.
        Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.
10.15    Applicable Law.
        
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD REQUIRE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER LAW.
        NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT:
           
(A)
THE LAW OF THE STATE IN WHICH EACH MORTGAGED PROPERTY IS SITUATED (THE "SITUS STATE") GOVERNS PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCING, IN THE SITUS STATE, PROVISIONAL REMEDIES DIRECTLY RELATED TO SUCH REAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER.
           
(B)
THE LAW OF THE SITUS STATE ALSO APPLIES TO THE EXTENT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT, NECESSARY TO CREATE, TO PERFECT, AND TO FORECLOSE THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND LIENS CREATED BY THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, BUT DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY OBLIGATION SECURED THEREBY. THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY NEW YORK LAW. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES STIPULATE AND AGREE THAT AGENT AND LENDERS MAY ENFORCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH NEW YORK LAW ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS TO SUE ANY LOAN PARTY TO COLLECT ANY INDEBTEDNESS, AND TO OBTAIN A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT AGAINST BORROWER IN THE SITUS STATE, NEW YORK, OR ELSEWHERE, BEFORE OR AFTER FORECLOSURE, AND IF AGENT OR ANY LENDER OBTAINS A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT OUTSIDE THE SITUS STATE, IT MAY ENFORCE THAT JUDGMENT IN THE SITUS STATE, AS WELL AS IN OTHER STATES.
10.16    Construction of Agreement; Nature of Relationship.
        Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) it has been represented by counsel in the negotiation and documentation of the terms of this Agreement, (ii) it has had full and fair opportunity to review and revise the terms of this Agreement, (iii) this Agreement has been drafted jointly by all of the parties hereto, and (iv) neither Agent nor any Lender or other Agent has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between Agent, the other Agents and Lenders, on one hand, and Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not be construed against or in favor of another party.
10.17    Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process.
        
ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST BORROWER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, BORROWER, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY
10.18    Waiver of Jury Trial.
         The scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each party hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.
EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED.
THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION 10.18 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER.
10.19    Confidentiality.
        Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Borrower that in any event a Lender may make disclosures (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential), (b) subject to the applicable limitations set forth herein, to the extent requested by any Government Authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this subsection 10.19, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of Borrower, (g) with the consent of Borrower, (h) to the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this subsection 10.19 or (ii) becomes available to Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower or (i) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's or its Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender or its Affiliates and that no written or oral communications from counsel to Agent and no information that is or is designated as privileged or as attorney work product may be disclosed to any Person unless such Person is a Lender or a participant hereunder; provided that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify Borrower of any request by any Government Authority or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such Government Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information and shall use its best efforts to afford Borrower the opportunity to object to such disclosure; and provided, further that in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto authorizes each other party hereto (and their respective employees, representatives or agents) to disclose all information and materials regarding the structure and tax aspects of the transaction to the extent required by Internal Revenue Code Section 6011 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in order to avoid the transaction described herein being treated as a "Confidential Transaction" as defined by such Treasury Regulations.
10.20    Counterparts; Effectiveness.
        This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto.
10.21    Judgment Currency.
(a)     If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures Agent or a Lender could purchase the U.S. Dollars with such other currency in New York, New York on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which any such judgment, or any relevant part thereof, is given.
(b)     The obligations of Borrower in respect of any sum due from it to Agent or any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by Agent or such Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency Agent or such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase U.S. Dollars with such other currency; if the U.S. Dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due Agent or such Lender in U.S. Dollars, Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Agent or such Lender against such loss, and if the U.S. Dollars so purchased exceed the sum originally due to Agent or such Lender in U.S. Dollars, Lender shall remit such excess to Borrower.
