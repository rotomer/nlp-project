Item 1.01. -  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
   On October 1, 2004, the Board of Directors of Joy Global Inc. amended the Joy Global Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The Plan is administered by a committee ("Committee") consisting entirely of independent directors. Prior to the amendment, the Plan permitted the Committee to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of Joy Global Inc. the authority to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock-based awards to participants, provided however that the Committee could not delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant awards to officers of Joy Global Inc. The amendment changes the limitation on the Committee's power to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant awards to state that the Committee may not delegate the authority to grant awards to executive officers of Joy Global Inc. The effect of the amendment is to permit the Committee to delegate the authority to the Chief Executive Officer to grant awards to officers of Joy Global Inc. who are not executive officers.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
