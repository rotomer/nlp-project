(a) Amendment to Credit Agreement.
        On November 10, 2006, the First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment") amending the Credit Agreement dated as of October 28, 2005 entered into by and among Joy Global Inc. (the "Company"), certain of its domestic subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A., LaSalle Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Harris N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the other lenders named therein (the "Credit Agreement") became effective. Generally, the Amendment (1) eliminated former Section 8.11(a) of the Credit Agreement, which had required the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, (2) eliminated former Section 8.11(d) of the Credit Agreement, which had restricted the amount of the Company's annual capital expenditures and (3) extended the term of the Credit Agreement to November 10, 2011.
        Bank of America, N.A., LaSalle Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Harris N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and several of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including investment banking, commercial banking, advisory, cash management, custody and trust services, for which they have received customary fees, and may do so again in the future.
        A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
(b) Registration Rights Agreement.
        On November 10, 2006, the Company and two of its subsidiaries, Joy Technologies Inc. and P&H Mining Equipment Inc. (the "Guarantors"), entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of November 10, 2006 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") among the Company, the Guarantors, and Banc of America Securities LLC, Lehman Brothers Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers (the "Initial Purchasers") named in the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold to the Initial Purchasers $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.000% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the "Senior Notes"). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and Guarantors agreed, among other things, to (1) file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission by February 8, 2007 with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Senior Notes for new senior notes of the Company having terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes; (2) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 by April 9, 2007; and (3) commence the registered exchange offer as soon as practicable after, and not more than 30 days after, the registration statement is declared effective. The Registration Rights Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors.
        Banc of America Securities LLC, Lehman Brothers Inc. and UBS Securities LLC and other Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including investment banking, commercial banking, advisory, cash management, custody and trust services, for which they have received customary fees, and may do so again in the future.
        A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
(c) Indenture, First Supplemental Indenture and Senior Notes
        On November 10, 2006, the Company entered into the Indenture, dated as of November 10, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the issuance of debt securities from time to time.
        On November 10, 2006, the Company also entered into the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 10, 2006 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Supplemental Indenture amends and supplements the Indenture and establishes the terms and conditions of the Senior Notes. The Supplemental Indenture provides that:
        On November 10, 2006, the Company completed the sale and issuance of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were issued under the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. The Company's obligations under the Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors.
        Copies of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the forms of the Senior Notes are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company (1) passed a resolution to increase the size of the Board of Directors from seven directors to nine directors and (2) elected Michael W. Sutherlin and Gale E. Klappa to serve as directors. Mr. Klappa was also made a member of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company on November 14, 2006 to announce the election of Mr. Sutherlin and Mr. Klappa is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
On November 13, 2006, the Human Resources and Nominating Committee (the "HRNC") of the Company's Board of Directors granted 25,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) to John N. Hanson, the Company's chairman, president and chief executive officer. The RSUs were granted under the 2003 Joy Global Inc. Stock Incentive Plan. Each RSU entitles Mr. Hanson to receive one share of the Company's common stock upon vesting, and accrues additional RSUs (subject to the same terms and conditions, including risk of forfeiture) in lieu of dividends at the same dividend rate payable on shares of the Company's common stock. One third of such grant vests on March 1 in each of 2008, 2009 and 2010, provided that Mr. Hanson remains the Company's non-executive chairman on the applicable vesting date.
Also on November 13, 2006, the HRNC approved the following additional arrangements relating to the retirement of Mr. Hanson and the planned departure of Donald C. Roof, the Company's executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer:

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT
November 10, 2006
BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC
LEHMAN BROTHERS INC.
UBS SECURITIES LLC
  As Representatives of the Several Purchasers
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Joy Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
Issuer
"), proposes to issue and sell to Banc of America Securities LLC, Lehman Brothers Inc., UBS Securities LLC and the other initial purchasers named in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "
Initial Purchasers
"), upon the terms set forth in a purchase agreement dated the same date as this Agreement (the "
Purchase Agreement
"),
$
250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.000% Senior Notes due 2016 and
$
150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the "
Initial Securities
") to be guaranteed (the "
Guarantees
") by the subsidiary guarantors named in Schedule A hereto (the "
Guarantors
" and, collectively with the Issuer, the "
Company
"). The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture and a Supplemental Indenture, each dated as of November 10, 2006 (collectively, the "
Indenture
"), among the Issuer, the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as trustee (the "
Trustee
"). As an inducement to the Initial Purchasers to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company agrees with the Initial Purchasers, for the benefit of the Initial Purchasers and the holders of the Securities (as defined below) (collectively the "
Holders
"), as follows:
1.
            
Registered Exchange Offer.
Unless not permitted by applicable law, the Company shall prepare and, not later than 90
days (such 90th day being a "
Filing Deadline
") after the date on which the Initial Purchasers purchase the Initial Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the "
Closing Date
"), file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") a registration statement (the "
Exchange Offer Registration Statement
") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
Securities Act
"), with respect to a proposed offer (the "
Registered Exchange Offer
") to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture, identical in all material respects to the
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
Initial Securities and registered under the Securities Act (the "
Exchange Securities
"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act within 150 days after the Closing Date (such 150th day being an "
Effectiveness Deadline
") and (ii) keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for not less than 20 business days (meaning days which do not include a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions are not required to be open in the State of New York (each such day, a "
Business Day
")) (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the Registered Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders (such period being called the "
Exchange Offer Registration Period
").
If the Company commences the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company (i) will be entitled to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer 20 Business Days after such commencement (provided that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer) and (ii) will be required to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer no later than 60 days after the date on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective (such 60th day being the "
Consummation Deadline
").
Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly, and in no event later than 30 days following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States.
The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, (i) each Holder which is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "
Exchanging Dealer
"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Exchange Offer Procedures" section and the "Purpose of the Exchange Offer" section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and (ii) an Initial Purchaser that elects to sell Securities (as defined below) acquired in exchange for Initial Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information required by Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable, in connection with such sale.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein,
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; provided, however, that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or an Initial Purchaser, such period shall be the lesser of 180 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Initial Purchasers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 180 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer.
If, upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser holds Initial Securities acquired by it as part of its initial distribution, the Company, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser upon the written request of such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "
Private Exchange
") for the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (including the existence of restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and the securities laws of the several states of the United States, but excluding provisions related to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) (the "
Private Exchange Securities
"). The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the "
Securities
".
In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(a)
          
mail to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b)
          
keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 Business Days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders;
(c)
          
utilize the services of a depository for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
(d)
          
permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last Business Day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company shall:
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
 
(x) accept for exchange all the Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange;
(y) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(z) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.

Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Shelf Registration.
If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated by the 250th day after the Closing Date, (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests in writing to the Issuer with respect to the Initial Securities (or the Private Exchange Securities) not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer or (iv) any Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser or an Exchanging Dealer) is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange (other than, in each case, by reason of such Holder being an Affiliate of the Company) and any such Holder so requests in writing to the Issuer, the Company shall take the following actions (the date on which any of the conditions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) occur, including in the case of clauses (iii) or (iv) the receipt of the required notice, being a "Trigger Date"):
(a)
          
The Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 45 days after the Trigger Date (such 45th day being a "
Filing Deadline
")) file with the Commission and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the Filing Deadline (such 60th day being an "
Effectiveness Deadline
") a registration statement (the "
Shelf Registration Statement
" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "
Registration Statement
") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "
Shelf Registration
"); provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder.
(b)
          
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of two years (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the date of its effectiveness or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant thereto or (ii) are no longer restricted securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof). The Company shall be deemed not to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities during that period, (i) unless such action is required by applicable law or (ii) such action is taken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons, including the acquisition or divestiture of assets, so long as the Company promptly complies with Section 3(j) hereof, if applicable.
(c)
          
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement, amendment or supplement, (i) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
3.

Exchange Act
")) of Exchange Securities received by such broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer (a "

(c)

(i)
           
The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of the Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Securities to be sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders may reasonably request a reasonable period of time prior to sales of the Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
(j)
           
Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above during the period for which the Company is required to maintain an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus and any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Holders of the Securities or purchasers of Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement a Registration Statement, any related prospectus or any document incorporated by reference, for a period not to exceed an aggregate of sixty (60) days in any calendar year if (i) an event occurs and is continuing (including a pending material acquisition or divestment of assets that has not yet been publicly disclosed) as a result of which the Registration Statement would, in the Company's good faith judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading and (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith that the disclosure of such event at such time would have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of the Company taken as a whole.

9095088.2 42012401
 
 
paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any such Participating Broker-Dealer shall suspend use of such prospectus, and the period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in Section 2(b) above and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 1 above shall each be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 3(j).

(n)
          
The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
(o)
          
The Company shall enter into such customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other action, if any, as any Holder of the Securities shall reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration.

In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company, if requested by any Holder of Securities covered thereby, shall cause (i) its counsel to deliver an opinion and updates thereof relating to the Securities in customary form addressed to such Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof and dated, in the case of the initial opinion, the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement or other Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions given in connection with underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and managing underwriters, if any; (ii) its officers to execute and deliver all customary documents and certificates and updates thereof requested by any underwriters of the applicable Securities and (iii) its independent public accountants to provide to the selling Holders of the applicable Securities and any underwriter therefor a comfort letter in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, subject to receipt of appropriate documentation as contemplated, and only if permitted, by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 72.

(s)
           
If a Registered Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Initial Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other Person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall mark, or cause to be marked, on the Initial Securities so exchanged that such Initial Securities are being canceled in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be; in no event shall the Initial Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.
(t)
           
The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) if the Initial Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Initial Securities, confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities covered by a Registration Statement, or (b) if the Initial Securities were not previously rated, cause the Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be rated with the appropriate rating agencies, if so requested by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities covered by such Registration Statement, or by the managing underwriters, if any.

Indemnified Parties
") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Securities) to which each Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
amendment or supplement thereto (including any free writing prospectus under Rule 433 of the Securities Act) or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; provided, however, that (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Issuer, each Guarantor or any of its controlling persons.
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than to the extent the indemnifying party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such omission or from any
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise under this Section 5. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, except that the Holders of Securities will have the right to employ counsel to represent the Holders who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Holders against the Issuer under Section 5(a) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Issuer in writing, (ii) counsel to the Holders reasonably acceptable to the Issuer reasonably determines that its representation of such Holders would present it with a conflict of interest or (iii) the Issuer has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Issuer. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, settle, compromise or consent to any entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment, to the extent otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to the terms hereof.
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders of Securities' obligations in this Section 5(d) to contribute are several and not joint.
(e)
          
The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(a)
          
Additional interest (the "
Additional Interest
") with respect to the Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below being herein called a "
Registration Default
"):
(i)
           
any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the applicable Filing Deadline;
(ii)
          
any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable Effectiveness Deadline;
(iii)
        
the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to the Consummation Deadline; or
(iv)
         
any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective by the Commission but (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder.
Additional Interest shall accrue on a series of Securities over and above the interest set forth in the title of such series of Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur with respect to such series of Securities, to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults with respect to such series of Securities have been cured, at a rate of 0.50% per annum (the "
Additional Interest Rate
").
 
 
9095088.2 42012401
 
 
 
(b)
          
A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iv) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Issuer where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Issuer that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Issuer is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 90 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
(c)
          
Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to Section 6(a) will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest Rate by the principal amount of the Securities and further multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest Rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
(d)
          
"
Transfer Restricted Securities
" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of an Initial Security for an Exchange Note, the date on which such Exchange Note is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement, (iv) the date on which such Security is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or is saleable pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or other substantially similar resale exception promulgated in the future under the Securities Act, but not Rule 144A under the Securities Act) or (v) the date such Security shall have otherwise been transferred by the holder thereof and a new Security not bearing a legend restricting further transfer shall have been delivered by the Company and subsequent disposition of such Security shall not require registration or qualification under the Securities Act or any similar state law then in force.

The Issuer covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by

Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)).

ANNEX A
 
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Issuer has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution".

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Issuer has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date, it will make this prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.

The Issuer will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers. Exchange Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the Exchange Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
For a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date the Issuer will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal. The Issuer has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the Holders of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the Holders of the Securities (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

Authentication and Delivery of Securities
 At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any Series having attached thereto appropriate Coupons, if any, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver such Securities to or upon the written order of the Company, signed by both (a) the chairman of its Board of Directors, or any vice chairman of its Board of Directors, or its president or any vice president and (b) by its treasurer or any assistant treasurer or its secretary or any assistant secretary without any further action by the Company. In authenticating such Securities and
 
10
 
 
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
(a)
          
a certified copy of any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the action taken pursuant to the resolution or resolutions delivered under clause (2) below;
(b)

(e)
          
an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Section 11.7, which shall state:
(i)
           
that the form or forms and terms of such Securities and Coupons, if any have been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or by a supplemental indenture as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii)
          
that such Securities and Coupons, if any have been duly authorized, and, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general equitable principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
(iii)
        
that all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of the Securities and Coupons, if any, and the related supplemental indenture, if any, have been complied with;
(iv)
         
the registration statement, if any, relating to the Securities of such series and any amendments thereto has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933 and to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened;
(v)
          
no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body in the United States is required for the issuance of the Securities of such Series, except such as have been obtained and such as may be required
 
11
 
 
under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in the United States in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities of such Series;
(vi)
         
neither the issue nor sale of the Securities of such Series will contravene the charter or by-laws of the Company or will conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is bound, or any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(vii)
       
the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series by the Trustee in accordance with the directions of the Company so to do, and the Company's execution and delivery of the Securities of such series, will not violate the terms of this Indenture;
provided
,
however
, that in the case of any Series issuable in Tranches, if the Trustee has previously received the documents referred to in Section 2.4(a)-(e) with respect to such Series, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such Series executed and delivered by the Company for original issuance upon receipt by the Trustee of the applicable Company Notice.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities and Coupons, if any, under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Company or if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture in a manner not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.10, together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 11.7 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 2.5
        
Execution of Securities

Such signatures may be the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. Any Coupons attached to any Unregistered Security shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile signature of any such officer of the Company.
 
12
 
 
 
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Securities or Coupons shall cease to be such officer before the Security or Coupon so signed shall be authenticated (in the case of the Securities) and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Company, such Security or Coupon nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security or Coupon had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Security or Coupon may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security or Coupon, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
SECTION 2.6
        
Certificate of Authentication
 Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
The Trustee shall not authenticate or deliver any Unregistered Security until any matured Coupons appertaining thereto have been detached and canceled, except as otherwise provided or permitted by this Indenture.
SECTION 2.7
      
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
 The Securities shall be issuable in denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Securities of any Series, the Securities of such Series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple thereof, which may be in Dollars or any Foreign Currency, and interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Securities shall be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Company executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, shall bear interest from the date and shall be payable on the dates, in each case, which shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3.
Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date shall be paid, in the case of Registered Securities, to the person in whose name that Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for the payment of such interest and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, upon surrender of the Coupon appertaining thereto in respect of the interest due on such interest payment date.
The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except for a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular Series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the close of business on the fifteenth day of the next
 
13
 
 
preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the close of business on the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
Any interest on any Security of any Series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date (called "defaulted interest" for the purpose of this Section) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant record date by virtue of his having been such Holder; and such defaulted interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or clause (2) below:
                      
(1)
          
The Company may elect to make payment of any defaulted interest to the persons in whose names any such Registered Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such Series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such defaulted interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest in respect of Registered Securities of such Series which shall be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date thereof to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Registered Holder at his address as it appears in the Security register, not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such defaulted interest in respect of Registered Securities of such Series shall be paid to the person in whose names such Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered on such special record date and such defaulted interest shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2)
          
The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest on the Registered Securities of any Series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of that Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Any defaulted interest payable in respect of any Security of any Series which is not a Registered Security shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustee in such manner that there is no discrimination as between the Holders of Registered Securities and other Securities of the same Series, and notice of the payment date therefor shall
 
14
 
 
be given by the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in New York, New York and London, England.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 2.8
       
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
 The Company will keep at the office or agency of the Trustee to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, Registered Securities as in this Article Two provided. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any Series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same Series in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder thereof, Unregistered Securities of a Series, which by their terms are registerable as to principal and interest, may, to the extent and under the circumstances specified pursuant to Section 2.3, be exchanged for Registered Securities of such Series, as may be issued by the terms thereof. At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of a Series, which by their terms provide for the issuance of Unregistered Securities, may, to the extent and under the circumstances specified pursuant to Section 2.3, be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such Series. Securities so issued in exchange for other Securities shall be of any authorized denomination and of like principal amount and maturity date, interest rate or method of determining interest, and shall be issued upon surrender of the Securities for which they are to be exchanged and, in the case of Coupon Securities, together with all unmatured Coupons and matured Coupons in default appertaining thereto, at the office of the Company provided for in Section 3.2 and upon payment, if the Company shall require, of charges provided therein. Unregistered Securities of any Series issued in exchange for Registered Securities of such Series between the regular record date for such Registered Security and the next interest payment date will be issued without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date, and Unregistered Securities surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities between such dates shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Unregistered Security will not be delivered in exchange for a Registered Security or Securities unless the Trustee receives a certificate signed by the person entitled to delivery of such Security or other items or documents fulfilling such conditions as shall be required by regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury, or shall be notified by the Company that such a certificate shall not be required by such regulations; provided, however, that no such Unregistered Security shall be delivered by the Trustee if the
 
15
 
 
Trustee or such agent shall have, or shall have been notified in writing by the Company that the Company has, actual knowledge that such certificate is false.
Upon presentation for registration of any Unregistered Securities of any Series which by its terms is registerable as to principal, at the office or agency of the Company to be maintained as provided in Section 3.2, such Security shall be registered as to principal in the name of the Holder thereof and such registration shall be noted on such Security. Any Security so registered shall be transferable on the registry books of the Company upon presentation of such Security at such office or agency for similar notation thereon, but such Security may be discharged from registration by being in a like manner transferred to bearer, whereupon transferability by delivery shall be restored. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, Unregistered Securities shall continue to be subject to successive registrations and discharges from registration at the option of the Holders thereof.
Unregistered Securities shall be transferable by delivery, except while registered as to principal. Registration of any Coupon Security shall not effect the transferability by delivery of the Coupons appertaining thereto which shall continue to be payable to bearer and transferable by delivery.
All Securities and Coupons issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities and Coupons surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities for redemption under Article Twelve or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not redeemed.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) below shall apply only to Securities in global form:
 
(1) Each Security in global form authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the depositary designated for such Security in global form or a nominee thereof and delivered to such depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Security in global form shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
16
 
 
 
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary for such Securities to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by such depositary or any such nominee to a successor depositary.
 
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Security in global form may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Security in global form in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the depositary for such Security in global form or a nominee thereof unless (a) such depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling, unable to continue as depositary for such Security in global form or has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Company has not appointed a successor within 90 days after such notification, (b) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company order that such Security in global form shall be so exchangeable, subject to such depositary's procedures, or (c) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Security in global form.
 
(4) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Security in global form for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the depositary for such Security in global form shall direct.
 
(5) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Security in global form or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Security in global form, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the depositary for such Security in global form or a nominee thereof.
 
SECTION 2.9
        
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 In case any temporary or definitive Security or Coupon shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same Series or Coupon, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security or Coupon so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security or Coupon shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and to any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee)
 
17
 
 
connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security or Coupon, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon); provided, however, that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of such Coupons at an office or agency of the Company located outside of the United States, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3, if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Security of any Series or Coupon issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such Series or Coupons duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities or Coupons shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by the law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
SECTION 2.10
    
Cancellation of Securities
 All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund and all Coupons surrendered for payment or exchange, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities or Coupons shall be issued in lieu thereof, except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities and Coupons, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities and Coupons unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
SECTION 2.11
     
Temporary Securities
 Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any Series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such Series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any Series may be issued as Registered Securities or Unregistered Securities with or without Coupons attached thereto, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such Series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for
 
18
 
 
temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such Series and thereupon temporary Securities of such Series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such Series a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same Series of authorized denominations and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, having attached thereto any appropriate Coupons. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any Series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such Series.
(a)
          
With respect to Registered Securities of any Series with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, the following payment provisions shall apply:
(i)
           
Except as provided in subparagraph (a)(2) or in paragraph (e) below, payment of the principal of any Registered Security will be made at the Place of Payment by delivery of a check in the Currency in which the Security is denominated on the payment date against surrender of such Registered Security, and any interest on any Registered Security will be paid at the Place of Payment by mailing a check in the Currency in which the Securities were issued to the Person entitled thereto at the address of such Person appearing on the Security register.
(ii)
          
Payment of the principal of and interest on such Security may also, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be made at such other place or places as may be designated by the Company by any appropriate method.
(b)
          
With respect to Registered Securities of any Series, the following payment provisions shall apply, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) below:
(i)
           
The Board of Directors may provide with respect to any Series of such Securities that Holders shall have the option to receive payments of principal of and interest on such Security in any of the Currencies which may be designated for such election in such Security by delivering to the Trustee a written election, to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, not later than the close of business on the record date immediately preceding the applicable payment date. Such election will remain in effect for such Holder until changed by the Holder by written notice to the Trustee (but any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the record date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such change may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Security with respect to which notice of redemption has been given by the Company pursuant to Article Twelve). Any Holder of any such Security who shall not
 
19
 
 
have delivered any such election to the Trustee not later than the close of business on the applicable record date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment date in the relevant Currency as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.12. Payment of principal shall be made on the payment date against surrender of such Securities. Payment of principal and interest shall be made at the Place of Payment by mailing a check in the applicable currency to the Person entitled thereto at the address of such Person appearing on the Security register.
(ii)
          
Payment of the principal of and interest on such Security may also, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be made at such other place or places as may be designated by the Company by any appropriate method.
(c)
          
Payment of the principal of any Unregistered Security and of interest on any Coupon Security will be made at such place or places outside the United States as may be designated by the Company by any appropriate method only in the Currency in which the Security is payable (except as provided in paragraph (e) below) on the payment date against surrender of the Unregistered Security, in the case of payment of principal, or the relevant Coupon, in the case of payment of interest. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below, payment with respect to Unregistered Securities and Coupons will be made by check, subject to any limitations on the methods of effecting such payment as shall be specified in the terms of the Security established as provided in Section 2.3 and as shall be required under applicable laws and regulations. Payment of the principal of and interest on Unregistered Securities may also, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be made at such other place or places as may be designated by the Company by any appropriate method.
(d)
          
Not later than the fourth Business Day after the record date for each payment date, the Trustee will deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the Currency in which each Series of the Securities are denominated, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of and interest on the Securities to be made on such payment date, specifying the amounts so payable in respect of the Registered and the Unregistered Securities and in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the Holders shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (b) above. If the Board of Directors has provided for the election referred to in paragraph (b) above and if at least one Holder has made such election, then not later than the second Business Day preceding such record date the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate in respect of the Dollar or Foreign Currency payments to be made on such payment date. The Dollar or Foreign Currency amount receivable by Holders of Registered Securities who have elected payment in another Currency as provided in paragraph (b) above shall be determined by the Company on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the second Business Day (the "Valuation Date") prior to such payment date and set forth in the applicable Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate.
(e)
          
If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency in which any of the Securities are denominated or payable, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the applicable Foreign Currency denominated Securities occurring after the last date on which the Foreign Currency was so used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the currency of payment for use on each such payment
 
20
 
 
date. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee and by the Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities with respect to such payment date shall be, in the case of a Foreign Currency other than a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Currency Determination Agent in the manner provided in paragraphs (g) or (h) below.
(f)
           
If the Holder of a Registered Security elects payment in a specified Currency as provided for by paragraph (b) and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected Currency, such Holder shall receive payment in the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election; and if a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars.
(g)
          
The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent as of each Valuation Date and shall be obtained by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
(h)
          
The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent as of each Valuation Date and shall be the sum obtained by adding together the results obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Valuation Date for such Component Currency.
(i)
           
For purposes of this Section 2.12 the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "Component Currency" shall mean any currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit, including but not limited to the Euro.
A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units or fractions thereof which such Component Currency represented in the relevant currency unit, including but not limited to the Euro, on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by specified amounts of such two or more currencies, the sum of which, at the Market Exchange Rate of such two or more currencies on the date of such replacement, shall be equal to the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the
 
21
 
 
Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to, the Euro, a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the applicable Valuation Date, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
"Market Exchange Rate" shall mean for any currency the noon Dollar buying rate for that currency for cable transfers quoted in New York City on the Valuation Date as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If such rates are not available for any reason with respect to one or more Currencies for which an exchange rate is required, the Currency Determination Agent shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of the most recent available date, or quotations from one or more major banks in New York City or in the country of issue of the currency in question, or such other quotations as the Currency Determination Agent shall deem appropriate. Unless otherwise specified by the Currency Determination Agent, if there is more than one market for dealing in any currency by reason of foreign exchange regulations or otherwise, the market to be used in respect of such currency shall be that upon which a nonresident issuer of securities designated in such currency would purchase such currency in order to make payments in respect of such securities.
All decisions and determinations of the Currency Determination Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in Specified Amounts as specified above shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company, the Trustee for the relevant series of Securities and all Holders of such Securities.
In the event that a Conversion Event has occurred with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 11.6 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event that a Conversion Event has occurred with respect to the Euro or any other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 11.6 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event of any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above, the Company, after learning thereof, will similarly give notice to the Trustee.
The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying on and acting upon the information so received by it from the Company and the Currency Determination Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
SECTION 2.13
     
Compliance with Certain Laws and Regulations
 If any Unregistered Securities or Coupon Securities are to be issued in any Series of Securities, the Company will
 
22
 
 
use reasonable efforts to provide for arrangements and procedures designed pursuant to then applicable laws and regulations, if any, to ensure that Unregistered Securities or Coupon Securities are sold or resold, exchanged, transferred and paid only in compliance with such laws and regulations and without adverse consequences to the Company.
SECTION 2.14
    
CUSIP Numbers
 The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall indicate the "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers of the Securities in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers.
SECTION 2.15
      
Securities in Global Form
 If Securities of or within a Series are issuable in whole or in part in global form, any such Security may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby, shall be made in such manner and by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.4 or 2.11. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 and, if applicable, Section 2.11, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company order. Any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or deliver or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 11.7 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
The provisions of the last paragraph of Section 2.4 shall apply to any Security in global form if such Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 11.7 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last paragraph of Section 2.4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.4, payment of principal of and interest on any Security in permanent global form shall be made to the Person or Persons specified in such Security.
Every Security in global form authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:
 
THIS SECURITY IS A SECURITY IN GLOBAL FORM WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF. THIS SECURITY MAY
 
23
 
 
NOT BE EXCHANGED OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.

Paying Agents
 Whenever the Company shall appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series, it will cause such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section,
(a)
          
that it will hold all sums received by it as such Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such Series or Coupons (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor on the Securities of such Series or Coupons) in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such Series or Coupons or of the Trustee, and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and upon the written request of the Trustee, pay over all such sums received by it to the Trustee,

(c)
          
that it will give the Trustee notice of any change of address of any Holder of which it is aware.
The Company will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such Series or Coupons, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Securities of any Series or Coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such Series or Coupons, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such Series or Holders of such Coupons a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge with respect to one or more or all Series of Securities or Coupons hereunder, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such Series by the Company or any Paying Agent hereunder, as required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained.

SECTION 3.6
        
Additional Amounts
 If Securities of a Series provide for the payment of additional amounts to any Holder who is a non-United States Person in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge ("Additional Amounts"), the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such Series or any Coupon appertaining thereto such Additional Amounts as may be so provided by Section 2.3. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of a Series or payment of any related Coupon or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of a Security of a Series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of
 
26
 
 
Additional Amounts provided for by the terms of such Series established pursuant to Section 2.3 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, if the Securities of a Series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal or interest on which any Additional Amount shall be payable, the Company will furnish the Trustee and the Company's principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with a compliance certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of or interest on the Securities of that Series shall be made to Holders of Securities of that Series or any related Coupons who are non-United States Persons without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of that Series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such compliance certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities of that Series or related Coupons and the Company will pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officer's Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section or in the event the Trustee shall not withhold or deduct any sums as a result of the non-receipt of a compliance certificate pursuant to this Section.
SECTION 3.7
        
Calculation of Original Issue Discount
 The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.

SECURITYHOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY THE
ISSUER AND THE TRUSTEE
SECTION 4.1
        
Company to Furnish Trustee Information as to Names and Addresses of Securityholders
 The Company covenants and agrees that it will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee for the Securities of each Series a list in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of the Registered Securities of each Series:
(a)
          
semiannually and not more than 15 days after each record date for the payment of interest on such Securities, as hereinabove specified, as of such record date and on dates to be determined pursuant to Section 2.3 for non-interest bearing securities in each year, and
(b)
          
at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of any such request such list to be as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such information is furnished,
provided
that if and so long as the Trustee shall be the Security registrar for such Series, such list shall not be required to be furnished but in any event the Company shall be required to furnish such information concerning the Holders of Coupon Securities and Unregistered Securities which is known to it; provided, further, that the Company shall have no obligation to investigate any matter relating to any Holder of an Unregistered Security or any Holder of a Coupon.
(a)
          
The Trustee for the Securities of each Series shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of each Series of Securities contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 or maintained by the Trustee in its capacity as Security registrar for such Series, if so acting. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
(b)
          
In case three or more Holders of Registered Securities of any Series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Securities of a particular Series (in which case the applicants must all hold Securities of such Series) or with Holders of all Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities and such application is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five business days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either
(i)
           
afford to such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, or
 
28
 
 
 
(ii)
          
inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Securities of such Series or all Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Securityholders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
If the Trustee shall elect not to afford to such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Securityholder of such Series or all Securities, as the case may be, whose name and address appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Securities of such Series or all Securities, as the case may be, or could be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of such order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
(c)
          
Each and every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under such subsection (b).
SECTION 4.3
        
Reports by the Company
 The Company covenants that, whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and to each Holder of Registered Securities, within 15 days after the Company is or would have been (if it were subject to such reporting obligations) required to file such with the Commission, annual and quarterly financial statements substantially equivalent to financial statements that would have been included in reports filed with the Commission, if the Company were subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, with respect to annual information only, a report thereon by the Company's certified independent public accountants as such would be required in such reports to the Commission, and, in each case, together with a management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which
 
29
 
 
would be so required and, unless the Commission will not accept such reports, file with the Commission the annual, quarterly and other reports which the Company is or would have been required to file with the Commission; provided, however, that if the Commission has accepted any report filed by the Company as provided in this paragraph and such report has been made available to the public on the Commission's EDGAR system (or any similar system), the Company will not be required to furnish such report to the Trustee or Holders of Registered Securities.
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel).
(a)
          
The Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. If required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall, within sixty days after each May 15 following the date of this Indenture deliver to Holders a brief report, dated as of such May 15, which complies with the provisions of such Section 313(a).
(b)
          
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange, if any, upon which the Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee when the Securities are listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof.

This provision, however, is subject to the condition that if at any time after the principal of the Securities of such Series (or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, such principal amount as may be determined in accordance with the terms thereof) shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3 for the Securities of such Series and except as provided in Section 2.12(b), (e) and (f) hereof) all matured installments of interest, if any, upon all the Securities of such Series and the principal of any and all Securities of such Series which shall have become due otherwise than by such acceleration (with interest upon such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate borne by the Securities of such Series (or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, at the yield to maturity) to the date of such payment or deposit) and in Dollars such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel and any and all Events of Default under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of such Series which shall have become due by such acceleration, shall have been remedied then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities of such Series then Outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee for the Securities of such Series, may waive all defaults and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 5.2
        
Collection of Indebtedness by Trustee; Trustee May Prove Debt
 The Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of any Series when such interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the Securities of any Series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of such Series or upon any redemption or by declaration or otherwise, then upon demand of the Trustee for the Securities of such Series, the Company will pay to the Trustee for the Securities of such Series for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such Series and the Holders of any Coupons appertaining thereto the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all Securities of such Series or such Coupons for principal of or interest, as the case may be (with interest to the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest specified in the Securities of such Series); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their
 
32
 
 
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee.
Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Company may pay the principal of and interest on the Securities of any Series to the persons entitled thereto, whether or not the principal of and interest on the Securities of such Series are overdue.
In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee for the Securities of such Series, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor upon such Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or other obligor upon such Securities and Coupons, wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.
In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and Coupons under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or its property or such other obligor, or in case of any other comparable judicial proceedings relative to the Company or other obligor under the Securities of any Series and Coupons, if any, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:
               
(a)
          
to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of such Series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be due and payable with respect to the Securities of such Series pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 5.1 hereof) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any Series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee) and of the Securityholders and the Holders of any Coupons appertaining thereto allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company or other obligor upon all Securities of any Series, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor,
(b)

33
 
 
 
(c)
          
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make payments to the Trustee for the Securities of such Series, and, in the event that such Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to such Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to such Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by such Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and all other amounts due to such Trustee or any predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 6.6.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any Series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.
All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Securities or any Coupon appertaining thereto, may be enforced by the Trustee for the Securities of such Series without the possession of any of the Securities of such Series or any Coupon appertaining thereto or the production thereof at any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and Holders of any Coupons in respect of which such action was taken.
In any proceedings brought by the Trustee for the Securities of such Series (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party), the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto parties to any such proceedings.
SECTION 5.3

SECOND:
      
In case the principal of the Securities of such Series in respect of which moneys have been collected shall not have become and be then due and payable, to the payment of interest on the Securities of such Series in default in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest specified in such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the persons entitled thereto, without discrimination or preference;
THIRD:
          
In case the principal of the Securities of such Series in respect of which moneys have been collected shall have become and shall be then due and payable, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon all the Securities of such Series for principal and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is permissible by law and that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest specified in the Securities of such Series; and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such Series, then to the payment of such principal and interest without preference or priority of principal over interest or of interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such Series over any other Security of such Series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest; and
FOURTH:

Suits for Enforcement
 In case an Event of Default has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
SECTION 5.5
       
Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings
 In case the Trustee for the Securities of any Series shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
 
35
 
 
 
SECTION 5.6
        
Limitations on Suits by Securityholders
 No Holder of any Security of any Series or Holder of any Coupon shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such Series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity, as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.9; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security and by a Holder of each Coupon appertaining thereto with every other taker and Holder of a Security or Holder of any Coupon appertaining thereto and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Securities of any Series or one or more Holders of any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have any right in any manner whatever, by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holder of Securities or any other Holders of such Coupons, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable Series and all the Holders of Coupons appertaining thereto. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

SECTION 5.8
        
Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of Default
 Except as provided in Section 5.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Securityholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Securityholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
 
36
 
 
acquiescence therein; and, subject to Section 5.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee, to the Securityholders or to the Holder of any Coupon appertaining thereto may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee, the Securityholders or Holders of any Coupon.

Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Securityholders.
SECTION 5.10
     
Waiver of Past Defaults
 Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of any Series as provided in Section 5.1, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such Series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such Series and Holders of all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto waive any past default hereunder or its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such Series. In the case of any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee, the Holders of the Securities of such Series and the Holder of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

respect to such Series, such notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice (the term "default" or "defaults" for the purposes of this Section being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such Series or any default in the payment of any sinking fund installment or analogous obligation in respect of any of the Securities of such Series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such Series.
SECTION 5.12
      
Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs
 All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security and each Holder of any Coupon, by his acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder or group of Securityholders of any Series holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such Series, or, in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (d) of Section 5.1 (if the suit relates to Securities of more than one but less than all Series), 10% in aggregate principal amount of Securities Outstanding affected thereby, or in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (d) (if the suit under clause (d) relates to all the Securities then Outstanding), (e), (f) or (g) of Section 5.1, 10% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the due date expressed in such Security.

CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE
SECTION 6.1
       
Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default; Prior to Default
 With respect to the Holders of any Series of Securities issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a particular Series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with respect to such Series, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a Series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) of which a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
 
38
 
 
 
No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(a)
          
prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any Series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to such Series which may have occurred:
(i)
           
the duties and obligations of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)
          
in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
(b)
          
the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(c)
          
the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders pursuant to Section 5.9 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.
None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the conditions of this Section 6.1.
(a)
          
the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, Officers' Certificate or any other certificate,
 
39
 
 
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the Company;
(c)
          
the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and any advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;
(d)
          
the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby;
(e)
          
the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
(f)
           
prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security, or other paper or document unless requested in writing to do so by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all Series affected then Outstanding; provided that, if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such investigation shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
(g)
          
the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys not regularly in its employ and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
(h)
          
the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default or Event of Default (other than any Event of Default under Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b)) unless a Responsible
 
40
 
 
Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of such default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee;
(i)
           
Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an officer of the Company, as applicable.
(j)
           
the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to,
 
and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder; and
(k)
          
the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by and person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
SECTION 6.3
       
Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals, Disposition of Securities or Application of Proceeds Thereof
 The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificate of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities or the Coupons. The Trustee represents that it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture and perform its obligations hereunder. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.
SECTION 6.4
        
Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities; Collections, etc
 The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Security registrar, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities or Coupons with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, if operative, may otherwise deal with the Company and receive, collect, hold and retain collections from the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
SECTION 6.5
       
Moneys Held by Trustee
 Subject to the provisions of Section 10.4 hereof, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law. Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be under any liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.
SECTION 6.6
        
Compensation and Indemnification of Trustee and Its Prior Claim
 The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee in Dollars (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Company covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse the Trustee and
 
41
 
 
each predecessor Trustee upon its request in Dollars for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by or on behalf of it in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all agents and other persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee), incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against or investigating any claim (whether asserted by the Company, a Holder or any other Person) of liability in the premises. The obligation of the Company under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Such additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities or the Holders of particular Coupons, and the Securities are hereby subordinated to such senior claim.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
SECTION 6.7
        
Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc
 Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, whenever in the administration of the trusts of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate complying with Section 11.7 delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it or under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.
SECTION 6.8
        
Disqualification of Trustee; Conflicting Interests
 If the Trustee for the Securities of any Series has or shall acquire any conflicting interest, as defined in the Trust Indenture Act, it shall, within 90 days after ascertaining that it has such conflicting interest, and if the default (as defined in the Trust Indenture Act) to which such conflicting interest relates has not been cured or waived or otherwise eliminated before the end of such 90-day period, the Trustee shall, either eliminate such conflicting interest or resign in the manner and with the effect specified in the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.
SECTION 6.9
       
Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee
 The Trustee for each Series of Securities hereunder shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, and which is authorized under such laws
 
42
 
 
to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State or District of Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.10.
(a)
          
The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all Series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Company and by mailing notice thereof to the Holders in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.6. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee or trustees with respect to the applicable Series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any Series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable Series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
(i)
           
the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 6.8 with respect to any Series of Securities after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such Series for at least six months unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act; or
(ii)
          
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder; or
(iii)
        
the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any Series of the Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable Series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee for such Series by written instrument, in
 
43
 
 
duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Company, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such Series for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such Series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
(c)
          
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such Series and appoint a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such Series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Company the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders.
If no successor Trustee shall have been appointed with respect to such series within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(d)
          
Within one year after the successor trustee takes office, the Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of that Series of Securities may appoint a successor trustee to replace the successor trustee appointed by the Company.
(e)
          
Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any Series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such Series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.11.
SECTION 6.11
     
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
 Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable Series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such Series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such Series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 10.4, pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
 
44
 
 
 
If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) Series, the Company, the predecessor Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable Series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
No successor trustee with respect to any Series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9.
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, the Company shall give notice in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.6 to the Holders of Securities of any Series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Company fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.
SECTION 6.12
    
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
 Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any Series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any Series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such Series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any Series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
 
45
 
 
 
SECTION 6.13
      
Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company
 If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
SECTION 6.14
    
Appointment of Authenticating Agent
 At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee, with the concurrence of the Company, may appoint an authenticating agent which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate the Securities issued upon original issue, and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 2.9, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent. Each authenticating agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as authenticating agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal, state or District of Columbia authority. If such authenticating agent files reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such authenticating agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so filed. If at any time an authenticating agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such authenticating agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an authenticating agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such authenticating agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an authenticating agent, shall continue to be an authenticating agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the authenticating agent.
An authenticating agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an authenticating agent by giving written notice thereof to such authenticating agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such authenticating agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor authenticating agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 11.8 to all Holders of Securities with respect to which such authenticating agent will serve. Any successor authenticating agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect
 
46
 
 
as if originally named as an authenticating agent. No successor authenticating agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Company agrees to pay to each authenticating agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
If an appointment with respect to the Securities is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities shall have a certificate of authentication thereon substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.2.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all Series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
(b)
          
The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the Security register.
(c)
          
The amount of Unregistered Securities held by any Person executing any instrument or writing as a Securityholder, the numbers of such Unregistered Securities, and the date of his holding the same may be proved by the production of such Securities or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, broker or member of a national securities exchange (wherever situated), as depositary, if such certificate is in form satisfactory to the Trustee, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Unregistered Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person executing such instrument or writing as a Securityholder, if such certificate or affidavit is in form satisfactory to the Trustee. The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Unregistered Security continues until (i) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Unregistered Security is produced, or (ii) such Unregistered Security is produced by some other person, or (iii) such Unregistered Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (iv) such Unregistered Security has been cancelled in accordance with Section 2.10.
SECTION 7.2
        
Proof of Execution of Instruments
 Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in
 
47
 
 
accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee.
SECTION 7.3
        
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
 The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such Series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security.
SECTION 7.4
       
Securities Owned by Company Deemed Not Outstanding
 In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all Series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of Holders of Securities, Securities which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, and for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
SECTION 7.5
        
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
 At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all Series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the corporate trust office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken

(h)

SECTION 8.2
       
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Securityholders
 With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article Seven) of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each Series affected by such supplemental indenture (treated as one class), the Company, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustee for such Series of Securities may, from time to time and at any time, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of execution thereof) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such Series; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for payment thereof or, if the Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any Series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security so affected.
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee for such Series of Securities of evidence of the consent of Securityholders as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustee for such Series of Securities shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects such Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case such Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall give notice in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.6 to the Holders of Securities of each Series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear on the Securities register of the Company, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
For the purposes of this Section 8.2 only, if the Securities of any Series are issuable upon the exercise of warrants, each holder of an unexercised and unexpired warrant with respect to such series shall be deemed to be a Holder of Outstanding Securities of such Series in the amount issuable upon the exercise of such warrant. For such purposes, the ownership of any such warrant shall be determined by the Company in a manner consistent with customary commercial practices. The Trustee for such series shall be entitled to rely on an Officers'
 
51
 
 
Certificate as to the principal amount of Securities of such Series in respect of which consents shall have been executed by holders of such warrants.
SECTION 8.3
     
Effect of Supplemental Indenture

SECTION 8.4
       
Documents to Be Given to Trustee
 The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article Eight complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
SECTION 8.5
        
Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental Indentures

If the Company or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any Series and any Coupons appertaining thereto so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such Series then Outstanding and any Coupons appertaining thereto then Outstanding.

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE OR CONVEYANCE
SECTION 9.1
        
Company May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
 Nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or corporations (whether or not affiliated with the Company), or successive consolidations or mergers in which the Company or its successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or shall prevent any sale, conveyance or lease of all or substantially all the property of the Company to any other corporation (whether or not affiliated with the Company) authorized to acquire and operate the same; provided, however, and the Company hereby covenants and agrees, that upon any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all of the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Company, shall be expressly assumed, by supplemental indenture satisfactory in form to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by the corporation (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation, or into which the
 
52
 
 
Company shall have been merged, or by the corporation which shall have acquired or leased such property.
 
SECTION 9.2
        
Successor Corporation Substituted
 In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and following such an assumption by the successor corporation, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein. Such successor corporation may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company prior to such succession any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All of the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
In the event of any such sale or conveyance (other than a conveyance by way of lease) the Company or any successor corporation which shall theretofore have become such in the manner described in this Article shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities and may be liquidated and dissolved.
SECTION 9.3
        
Opinion of Counsel to Trustee
 The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Section 11.7, as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

(b)
          
In addition to the provisions of Section 10.1(a), the Company may terminate its obligations under the Securities of any Series and this Indenture with respect to such Series, except those obligations referred to in the penultimate paragraph of this Section 10.1, if the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office or such other office as the Trustee may designate, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Securityholders of such Series for that purpose, (i) cash in the currency or currency unit required or, (ii) Government Obligations maturing as to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times as are sufficient, in the opinion of a firm of independent certified public accountants, without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal or interest, to pay the principal of and interest on the outstanding Securities of such Series and Coupons to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to the payment of said principal of and interest on the Outstanding Securities and Coupons of such Series.
Such irrevocable trust agreement shall include, among other things, provision for (1) payment of the principal of and interest on the Securities of such Series and Coupons when due (by redemption, sinking fund payments or otherwise), (2) the payment of the expenses of the Trustee incurred or to be incurred in connection with carrying out such trust provisions, (3) rights of registration, transfer, substitution and exchange of Securities of such Series and Coupons in accordance with the terms stated in this Indenture and (4) continuation of the rights and obligations and immunities of the Trustee as against the Securityholders of such Series as stated in this Indenture.

Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 6.6, 10.4 and 10.5 shall survive.
After any such irrevocable deposit, accompanied by an Officers' Certificate which shall state that the provisions of the first two paragraphs of this Section 10.1(b) have been complied with, and upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of (i) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that either (a) as a result of such deposit and the related exercise of the Company's option under this Section 10.1(b) registration will not be required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, by the Company, the trust funds representing such deposit or the Trustee or (b) all necessary registrations under such Act have been effected and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that Securityholders of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and discharge and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such deposit and discharge had not occurred, then the Company shall be discharged of its obligations under the Securities of such Series and this Indenture with respect to such Series except for those surviving obligations specified above, and the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing such discharge. Prior to the delivery of such acknowledgment, the Trustee may require the Company to deliver to it an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the deposit and
 
55
 
 
discharge contemplated by this provision have been complied with, and the Trustee may also require that the Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (i) of this paragraph shall also state that such deposit does not violate applicable law.
SECTION 10.2

SECTION 10.3
     
Repayment of Moneys Held by Paying Agent
 In connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to Securities of any Series or Coupons, all moneys then held by any Paying Agent under the provisions of this Indenture with respect to such Series of Securities or Coupons shall, upon demand of the Company, be repaid to it or paid to the Trustee and thereupon such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such moneys.
SECTION 10.4
     
Return of Unclaimed Moneys Held by Trustee and Paying Agent
 Any moneys deposited with or paid to the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security of any Series or Coupons and not applied but remaining unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such principal or interest shall have become due and payable, shall, upon the written request of the Company and unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law, be repaid to the Company by the Trustee for such Series or such Paying Agent, and the Holder of the Security of such Series or Holders of Coupons appertaining thereto shall, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property laws, thereafter look only to the Company for any payment which such Holder may be entitled to collect, and all liability of the Trustee or any Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease.
SECTION 10.5
     
Reinstatement of Company's Obligations
 If the Trustee is unable to apply any funds or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 10.1 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application or by reason of the Trustee's inability to convert any such funds or Government Obligations into the currency or currency unit required to be paid with respect to the Securities of such Series, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of any Series for which such application is prohibited shall be revived and reinstated as if no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 10.1 until such time as the Trustee is permitted to apply all such funds or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 10.1 or is able to convert all such funds or Government Obligations; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any of such Securities or Coupons because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Securityholders of such Securities to receive such payment from the funds or Government Obligations held by the Trustee.

SECTION 11.2
   
Provisions of Indenture for the Sole Benefit of Parties and Securityholders
 Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities or Coupons, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto, any Paying Agent and their successors hereunder and the Holders of the Securities and Coupons, if any, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and of the Holders of the Securities and Coupons.

SECTION 11.5
      
Severability
 In case any one or more of the provisions in this Indenture or in any Security shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the provisions hereof shall be enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.
SECTION 11.6
     
Notices and Demands on Company, Trustee and Securityholders
 Any notice or demand which by any provision of this Indenture is required or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee, by the Holders of Securities, or by the Holders of Coupons to or on the Company may be given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Company is filed by the Company with the Trustee) to Joy Global Inc., 100 East Wisconsin Ave., Suite 2780, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, Attention: Secretary. Any notice, direction, request or demand by

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, (1) if any of the Securities affected by such event are Registered Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid to such Registered Holders as their names and addresses appear in the Security register within the time prescribed and (2) if any of the Securities affected by such event are Unregistered Securities or Coupon Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if published once in a newspaper of general circulation in New York, New York and London, England within the time prescribed.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders, and any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given. If the Company mails a notice or communication to the Holders of Securities, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each security registrar, co-registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, with respect to the Securities.
In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Company and Securityholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

Determination of Principal Amount
 In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities of any Series have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, whether a quorum is present at a meeting of Holders of Securities or whether sufficient funds are available for redemption or for any other purpose, the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.1 and the principal amount of any Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency or Euro that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be determined by converting the Foreign Currency or the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate as of the date of such determination.
ARTICLE TWELVE
 
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES AND SINKING FUNDS
SECTION 12.1
     
Applicability of Article
 The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any Series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a Series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such Series.
SECTION 12.2
      
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
 Notice of redemption to the Holders of Securities of any Series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Company shall be given by giving notice of such redemption as provided in Section 11.6, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such Series. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a Series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such Series.
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers), specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the Place or Places of Payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, and that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Coupon Securities, if any, surrendered for payment must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the redemption date, failing which the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the sum due for payment, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue and that, if less than all of the Outstanding Securities of a Series are to be redeemed, the identification and principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed. If less than all of the Securities of any Series and to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the numbers of the Securities of such Series to be redeemed, and, if only Unregistered Securities of any Series are to be redeemed, and if such Unregistered Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities, the last date on which exchanges of Unregistered Securities for Registered Securities not subject to redemption may be made. In case any Security of a Series is to be redeemed in part, the notice of
 
60
 
 
redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security and any Coupons appertaining thereto, a new Security or Securities of such Series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof with appropriate Coupons will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any Series to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. The Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days prior written notice of any redemption hereunder.
Not later than 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Company will have on deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4) an amount of money in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series and any Coupons appertaining thereto are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 and except as provided in Sections 2.12(b), (e) and (f) of this Indenture) sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such Series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the Outstanding Securities of a Series are to be redeemed, the Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of a Series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such Series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities of such Series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such Series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any Series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 12.3
     
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and, except as provided in Sections 6.5 and 10.4, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together
 
61
 
 
with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that any semiannual payment of interest on Registered Securities becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.4 hereof.
If any Coupon Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing on or after the date fixed for redemption, such Security may be paid after deducting from the redemption price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside of the United States.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest borne by the Security.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only and the Coupons appertaining thereto, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities and the Coupons appertaining thereto, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
SECTION 12.4
    
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
 Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in a written statement signed by an authorized officer of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company.
SECTION 12.5
     
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
 The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any Series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any Series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date".
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Series of Securities in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such Series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory
 
62
 
 
sinking fund) by the Company or receive credit for Securities of such Series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such Series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Company through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such Series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any Series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.7) signed by an authorized officer of the Company (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 for the Securities of such Series and except as provided in Section 2.12(b), (e) and (f) hereof), and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such Series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such Series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such Series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing, (d) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such Series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Company intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date and (e) specifying such sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such Series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Company to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Company shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such Series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash (in the currency or currency unit described above) without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such Series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such Series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash (in the currency or currency unit described above) on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular Series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such Series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such
 
63
 
 
Series are payable, or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable, is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such Series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be possible, and shall (if requested in writing by the Company) inform the Company of the serial numbers of the Securities of such Series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities of any Series which are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Company or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be excluded from Securities of such Series eligible for selection for redemption. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company (or the Company, if it shall so notify the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such Series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.3) for the redemption of Securities of such Series in part at the option of the Company. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such Series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such Series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular Series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such Series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such Series at maturity.
The Trustee shall not convert any currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable for the purposes of such sinking fund application unless specifically requested to do so by the Company, and any such conversion agreed to by the Trustee in response to such request shall be for the account and at the expense of the Company and shall not affect the Company's obligation to pay the Holders in the currency or currency unit to which such Holder may be entitled.
Not later than 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the sinking fund payment date, the Company shall have paid to the Trustee in cash (in the currency or currency unit described in the third paragraph of this Section 12.5) or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a Series with sinking fund moneys or mail or publish any notice of redemption of Securities for such Series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing or publication of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such Series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article Five and held for the payment of all
 
64
 
 
such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
SECTION 12.6
      
Repayment at the Option of the Holders
 Securities of any Series which are repayable at the option of the Holders thereof before their stated maturity shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such Series.
The repayment of any principal amount of Securities pursuant to such option of the Holder to require repayment of Securities before their stated maturity, for purposes of Section 10.1, shall not operate as a payment, redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the Company, at its option, shall deliver or surrender the same to the Trustee with a directive that such Securities be cancelled.

Notice of every meeting of the Holders of Securities of any Series, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be given to Holders of Securities of such Series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section  11.6. Such notice shall be given not less than 20 nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

 To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders, a person shall be (a) a Holder of one or more Securities with respect to which such meeting is being held or (b) a person appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy by such Holder. The only persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Holders shall be the persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Trustee for the Securities of the Series with respect to which such meeting is being held and its counsel and any representatives of the Company and its counsel.
SECTION 14.5
      
Regulations
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee for the Securities of any Series may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of the Securities of such Series, in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of such Series and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall think fit.
The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of the Securities of such Series as provided in Section 14.3, in which case the Company or the Holders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman.

Subject to Section 7.4, at any meeting each Holder of Securities with respect to which such meeting is being held or proxy therefor shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 (or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which such Securities are denominated, as determined pursuant to Section 11.13) principal amount (in the case of the Original Issue Discount Securities, such principal amount to be determined as provided in Section 11.13) of Securities held or represented by him. However, no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any such Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of the Securities of such Series held by him or instruments in writing aforesaid duly designating him as the person to vote on behalf of other Holders of such Series. At any meeting of Holders, the presence of persons holding or representing Securities with respect to which such meeting is being held in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to take action on the business for the transaction of which such meeting was called shall constitute a quorum, but, if less than a quorum is present, the persons holding or representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Securities represented at the meeting may adjourn such meeting with the same effect, for all intents and purposes, as though a quorum had been present. Any meeting of Holders of Securities with respect to which a meeting was duly called pursuant to the provisions of Section 14.2 or Section 14.3 may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of such Holders present, whether or not constituting a quorum, and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to such record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that such notice was given in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.6. The record shall show the serial numbers of the Securities voting in favor of or against any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the duplicates shall be delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee.
Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.
SECTION 14.7
     
No Delay of Rights by Meeting
 Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall be deemed or construed to authorize or permit, by reason of any call of a meeting of Holders or any rights expressly or impliedly conferred hereunder to make such call, any hindrance or delay in the exercise of any right or rights conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders under any of the provisions of this Indenture or of the Securities of any Series.

Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule l44A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.
 
SECTION 2.9. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES
 
(a)
Unconditional Guarantee
. The Company shall cause each of the Company's current and future domestic Subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under (1) the Credit Agreement or (2) any credit agreement that replaces or refinances the Credit Agreement and under which the Company may borrow not less than $50.0 million (each a "Guarantor") to enter into a Guarantee contemporaneously with the satisfaction by such domestic Subsidiary of the conditions of either clause (1) or clause (2) of this sentence. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees (such guarantee is referred to herein as a "Guarantee"), jointly and severally, to each Holder of a Note and to the Trustee, the prompt payment when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at the place and in the manner provided in the terms of the Notes and in the Indenture of: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, interest, if any, and additional amounts required by the Notes, if any, on each of the Notes at the respective times provided in the terms of the Notes and in the Indenture, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise and whether any such amounts are allowed or allowable in any bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, (ii) interest on any overdue amounts specified in the terms of the Notes and in the Indenture, and (iii) all other amounts payable by the Company under the Indenture or under the Notes including, without limitation, amounts payable to the Trustee or the Holders under Section 6.6 and Article Five of the Indenture, all in accordance with the terms hereof and the terms of the Notes, subject, however, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.9. In case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or of any such other payment obligations, each Guarantor hereby agrees to pay promptly such Notes in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. This is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be absolutely unconditional, irrespective of any lack of validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, any failure to enforce the same, any waiver or consent to the Company with respect thereto by any Holder or the Trustee, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes, the Indenture and in this Guarantee. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
Company, any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or any Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or any Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five of the Indenture for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Five of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of this Guarantee.
 
(b)
Severability
. In case any provision of this Guarantee shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
(c)
Limitation of Guarantor's Liability
. Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the guarantee by such Guarantor pursuant to its Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar Federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
(d)
Release of Guarantor
. The Guarantee will, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be automatically and unconditionally released without any action on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes: (i) with respect to a Guarantor which no longer borrows or guarantees any amounts under (A) the Credit Agreement or (B) any credit agreement that replaces or refinances the Credit Agreement and under which the Company may borrow not less than $50.0 million; (ii) unless otherwise required under Section 2.9(h), (A) upon any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Guarantor's assets to any Person not an affiliate of Company or (B) upon any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's direct and indirect interest in such Guarantor; (iii) upon the payment in full of the Notes; or (iv) discharge of the Notes pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Indenture. The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request by the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel certifying as to the compliance with this Section 2.9(d).
 
(e)
Waiver of Subrogation
. Until all the Notes and all other payment obligations of the Company hereunder or under any Notes are paid in full, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claims or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under the
Guarantee and the Indenture, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Holder against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Securities shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Holders, and shall, forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such Holders to be credited and applied upon the Notes, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 2.9(e) is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
 
(f)
Execution of Guarantee
.
(i) To evidence their Guarantee to the Holders set forth in this Section 2.9, each Guarantor hereby agrees to execute the Guarantee in substantially the form shown in
Exhibit A
and
Exhibit B
attached hereto, which shall be endorsed on each Note ordered to be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee after the date such Guarantor becomes a Guarantor; provided, however, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, require any Guarantor that delivers a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 2.9 to execute after the date of such supplemental indenture a Guarantee on any outstanding Note. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in this Section 2.9 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure (A) to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee or (B) to confirm that its obligations under the Guarantee shall survive any consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance pursuant to Section 2.9(i). Each such Guarantee shall be signed on behalf of each Guarantor by one of its authorized officers prior to the authentication of the Note on which it is endorsed, and the delivery of such Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of such Guarantee on behalf of such Guarantor. Such signatures upon the Guarantee may be by manual or facsimile signature of such officers and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Guarantee, and in case any such officer who shall have signed the Guarantee shall cease to be such officer before the Note on which such Guarantee is endorsed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Company, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed the Guarantee had not ceased to be such officer of the Guarantor.
 
(ii) Any supplemental indenture entered into and delivered pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall provide such Guarantor's address for notice pursuant to Section 11.4 of the Indenture.
 
(g)
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
. Each Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Guarantor from performing its Guarantee as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
affect the covenants or the performance of the Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) each Guarantor hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
(h)
Guarantor Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance, Transfer or Lease
. A Guarantor may not directly or indirectly sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving person), another Person, other than the Company or another Guarantor, unless immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no default or Event of Default exists and the person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor hereunder and under the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee or by operation of law.
 
SECTION 2.10. REDEMPTION
 
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of either series of the Notes at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the applicable redemption date:
 
(a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and
 
(b) as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the principal amount and the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the applicable redemption date), discounted to the applicable Redemption Date in accordance with customary market practice on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate plus 0.300% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes.
 
The Redemption Prices of Notes to be redeemed will be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notice of redemption of either series of Notes will be given as provided in Section 11.6 of the Indenture. If the Company redeems less than all of a particular series of Notes, the Trustee will select the particular Notes to be redeemed by lot, on a pro rata basis or by another method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate and as otherwise provided in the Indenture.
 
Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the applicable redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of the applicable series or portions of the Notes of the applicable series called for redemption.
 
SECTION 2.11. CHANGE OF CONTROL
 
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Company has exercised its redemption rights under Section 2.10, the Company shall make an offer (a
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
"Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of each Holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and stating: (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 2.11 and that all Notes properly tendered will be accepted for payment; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"); (3) if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment specified in the notice; (4) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (5) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and (8) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 thereof. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 2.11, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 2.11 by virtue of such conflict. With respect to a series of Notes, in the event that such series of Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of such arrangement (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of such series of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies), the Trustee shall request in writing from each Rating Agency the reason for such reduction from an Investment Grade Rating to a below Investment Grade Rating and whether such reduction was the result, in whole or substantially in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control.
 
(b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (1)
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered by such Holder, if any;
provided
, that each such new Note shall be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 thereof. The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third Person makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.11 and all other provisions of this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
 
SECTION 2.12. SINKING FUND
 
The Notes shall not have the benefit of a sinking fund.
 
SECTION 2.13. METHODS OF RECEIVING PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES
 
If a Holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Company at least ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date, the Company will make all payments on such Holder's Notes in accordance with those instructions. Otherwise, payments on the Notes will be made at the office or agency of the Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes within the City and State of New York unless the Company elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register of Holders.
 
 
SECTION 2.14. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE, TRANSFER OR LEASE

(b) Upon the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 2.19(b) respect to the Outstanding Notes of any series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 2.11, 2.15 and 2.16 hereunder with respect to all Outstanding Notes as to which this option is exercised, on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and such Outstanding Notes shall thereafter be deemed not Outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed Outstanding for all other purposes hereunder and under the Indenture. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Notes of any series as to which the Covenant Defeasance has occurred, the Company shall not need to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant with respect to such Notes, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5.1 of the Indenture or hereunder with respect to such Notes, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby.
 
(c) The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 2.19(a) or 2.19(b) hereof to any Notes or any series of Notes, as the case may be, to be defeased:
 
(i)(A) The Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes as to which Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will occur, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations, a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the redemption date of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes, and the Holders of such Notes must have a valid, perfected, exclusive security interest in such trust; (B) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that: (1) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling or (2) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such Notes will
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (C) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to such Trustee confirming that the Holders of such Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (D) no Event of Default with respect to such Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit; (E) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; (F) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding
any other creditors of the Company; and (G) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the conditions precedent provided for in, in the case of the Officers' Certificate, (A) through (F) and, in the case of the Opinion of Counsel, clauses (A) (with respect to the validity and perfection of the security interest), (B), (C) and (E) of this paragraph have been complied with and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (which may contain customary qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an assumption that there has been no intervening bankruptcy of the Company between the date of deposit and the 91st day following the deposit and an assumption that no Holder of such Notes is an "insider" of the Company under applicable Federal bankruptcy law), after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and the creation of the defeasance trust does not violate the Investment Company Act of 1940. The defeasance will be effective on the earlier of (i) the 91st day after the date of deposit, and (ii) the day on which all the conditions above have been satisfied.
 
(ii) If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to be so defeased when due, then the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such Notes will be revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.
 
(d) Subject to Section 2.19(e), all cash and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 2.19(d), the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.19(c) in respect of any Notes to be defeased shall be held in trust and applied by the Paying Agent, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and the Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any
 
9091443 06121973
 
 
other Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 2.19(c) or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Notes.
 
(e) Anything in this Section 2.19 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any cash or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 2.19(c) which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 2.19(c)(A) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
(f) If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any cash or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 2.19(a) or (b), as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture with respect to such Notes affected and such Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 2.19(a) or (b) until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply such money in accordance with Sections 2.19(a) and (b) hereof, as the case may be;
provided, however
, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any such Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the cash or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

JOY GLOBAL INC.
6.000% NOTE DUE 2016
 
JOY GLOBAL INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of Two Hundred Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000,000) on November 15, 2016, and to pay interest thereon from November 10, 2006, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2007, at the rate of 6.000% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.000% Note Due 2016 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such interest payment date; provided, however, that interest payable on the interest payment date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such regular record date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of them.
If, with respect to a series of Notes, (i) the Company fails to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 90th day after the issue date; (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 150th day after the issue date; (iii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated on or before the 60th day after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the
 
 
 
 
 
Registration Rights Agreement) is declared effective; (iv) the Company is obligated to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and fails to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 45th day after the date on which the obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) arises; (v) the Company is obligated to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the Shelf Filing Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); or (vi) after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), as the case may be, is declared effective, such registration statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) (each such event referred to in the preceding clauses (i) through (vi) a "Registration Default"); then additional interest shall accrue on such series of Notes over and above the interest set forth in the title of such series of Notes from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur with respect to such series of Notes, to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults with respect to such series of Notes have been cured, at a rate of 0.50%. That portion of interest accruing as a result of a Registration Default is referred to herein as "Additional Interest."
Whenever in this Note or in the Indenture there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) payable as described in this Note to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect of this Note and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) in any provisions of this Note shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions of this Note where such express mention is not made.
Any accrued and unpaid interest on this Note upon the issuance of an Exchange Note (as defined in the Indenture) in exchange for this Note shall cease to be payable to the Holder hereof but such accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable on the next interest payment date for such Exchange Note to the Holder thereof on the related regular record date.
Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture and a supplemental indenture, each dated as of November 10, 2006 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more Notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the redemption date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 30 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof at least 30 and
 
 
 
 
 
not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the applicable series of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary market practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.000% Note Due 2016 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such interest payment date; provided, however, that interest payable on the interest payment date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such regular record date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of them.

declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 150th day after the issue date; (iii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated on or before the 60th day after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is declared effective; (iv) the Company is obligated to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and fails to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 45th day after the date on which the obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) arises; (v) the Company is obligated to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the Shelf Filing Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); or (vi) after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), as the case may be, is declared effective, such registration statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) (each such event referred to in the preceding clauses (i) through (vi) a "Registration Default"); then additional interest shall accrue on such series of Notes over and above the interest set forth in the title of such series of Notes from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur with respect to such series of Notes, to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults with respect to such series of Notes have been cured, at a rate of 0.50%. That portion of interest accruing as a result of a Registration Default is referred to herein as "Additional Interest."
Whenever in this Note or in the Indenture there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) payable as described in this Note to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect of this Note and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) in any provisions of this Note shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions of this Note where such express mention is not made.
Any accrued and unpaid interest on this Note upon the issuance of an Exchange Note (as defined in the Indenture) in exchange for this Note shall cease to be payable to the Holder hereof but such accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable on the next interest payment date for such Exchange Note to the Holder thereof on the related regular record date.
Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture and a supplemental indenture, each dated as of November 10, 2006 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $0, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more Notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the redemption date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as
 
 
 
 
 
defined below), plus 30 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the applicable series of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary market practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations so received.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that redemption date.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described in the Indenture at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the Change of Control Payment Date.

JOY GLOBAL INC.
6.625% NOTE DUE 2036
 
 
JOY GLOBAL INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of One Hundred Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000,000) on November 15, 2036, and to pay interest thereon from November 10, 2006, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2007, at the rate of 6.625% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.625% Note Due 2036 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such interest payment date; provided, however, that interest payable on the interest payment date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such regular record date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of them.
 
If, with respect to a series of Notes, (i) the Company fails to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 90th day after the issue date; (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 150th day after the issue date; (iii) the Exchange Offer is not
 
 
 
 
 
consummated on or before the 60th day after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is declared effective; (iv) the Company is obligated to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and fails to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 45th day after the date on which the obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) arises; (v) the Company is obligated to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the Shelf Filing Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); or (vi) after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), as the case may be, is declared effective, such registration statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) (each such event referred to in the preceding clauses (i) through (vi) a "Registration Default"); then additional interest shall accrue on such series of Notes over and above the interest set forth in the title of such series of Notes from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur with respect to such series of Notes, to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults with respect to such series of Notes have been cured, at a rate of 0.50%. That portion of interest accruing as a result of a Registration Default is referred to herein as "Additional Interest."
Whenever in this Note or in the Indenture there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) payable as described in this Note to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect of this Note and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) in any provisions of this Note shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions of this Note where such express mention is not made.
Any accrued and unpaid interest on this Note upon the issuance of an Exchange Note (as defined in the Indenture) in exchange for this Note shall cease to be payable to the Holder hereof but such accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable on the next interest payment date for such Exchange Note to the Holder thereof on the related regular record date.
Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture and a supplemental indenture, each dated as of November 10, 2006 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $150,000,000, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more Notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the redemption date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 37.5 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the
 
 
 
 
 
Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the applicable series of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary market practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations so received. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Lehman Brothers Inc., UBS Securities LLC, and one other nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer to be selected by Joy Global, and their respective successors (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States, in which case Joy Global will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that redemption date.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described in the Indenture at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the Change of Control Payment Date. Additional terms and conditions relating to Change of Control Offers are set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture. With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note of the applicable series affected thereby: (a) change the stated maturity date of any installment of principal of or interest, or reduce the principal amount of or the rate (or extend the time for payment) of interest, or any premium payable upon the redemption of any Notes; (b) reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity; (c) change the place or currency of payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest; (d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, the Notes; (e) reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of such series of Outstanding Notes, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any amendment or waiver provided for in the Indenture; (f) modify any of the waiver
 
 
 
 
 
provisions, except to increase any required percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Note of the series affected thereby; (g) cause any such Note to become subordinate in right of payment to any other Debt, except to the extent provided in the terms of such Note; or (h) impair such holder's right to require repurchase or conversion of the Notes on the terms provided therein.
The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Registrar (initially Wells Fargo Bank, National Association) in the registry books maintained by such Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name a Note is registered as the owner for all purposes whether or not such Note be overdue and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
This Note is in the form of a Security in global form as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Security in global form representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture, in any Security or Coupon appertaining thereto, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance of the Securities and Coupons, if any, by the Holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Notes are subject to defeasance at the option of the Company as provided in the Indenture.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

JOY GLOBAL INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assignees, the principal sum of Zero Dollars ($0) on November 15, 2036, and to pay interest thereon from November 10, 2006, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2007, at the rate of 6.625% per annum, until the principal hereof becomes due and payable, and at such rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this 6.625% Note Due 2036 (this "Note," and all of the Notes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes") (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such interest payment date; provided, however, that interest payable on the interest payment date occurring at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such regular record date by virtue of his having been such Holder, and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor debt securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of them.

date; (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 150th day after the issue date; (iii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated on or before the 60th day after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is declared effective; (iv) the Company is obligated to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and fails to file the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Commission on or prior to the 45th day after the date on which the obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) arises; (v) the Company is obligated to file a Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the Shelf Filing Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); or (vi) after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), as the case may be, is declared effective, such registration statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) (each such event referred to in the preceding clauses (i) through (vi) a "Registration Default"); then additional interest shall accrue on such series of Notes over and above the interest set forth in the title of such series of Notes from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur with respect to such series of Notes, to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults with respect to such series of Notes have been cured, at a rate of 0.50%. That portion of interest accruing as a result of a Registration Default is referred to herein as "Additional Interest."
Whenever in this Note or in the Indenture there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) payable as described in this Note to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect of this Note and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if any) in any provisions of this Note shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions of this Note where such express mention is not made.

Payments of interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Principal and any premium and interest payable at maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such Note at the office of a Paying Agent in The City of New York, New York or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate.
Unless the certificate of authentication herein has been duly executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture and a supplemental indenture, each dated as of November 10, 2006 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $0, except that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders, "reopen" the series and issue more Notes that have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as this Note.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the redemption date or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date
 
 
 
 
 
on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 37.5 basis points, plus in either of case (i) or (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. Holders of Notes to be redeemed will receive notice thereof at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed rate notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the applicable series of the Notes to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary market practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations so received. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Lehman Brothers Inc., UBS Securities LLC, and one other nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer to be selected by Joy Global, and their respective successors (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States, in which case Joy Global will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that redemption date.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described in the Indenture at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the Change of Control Payment Date. Additional terms and conditions relating to Change of Control Offers are set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or purchase the Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture without the consent of the Holders for limited purposes specified in the Indenture. With the consent of the Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing the provisions of the Indenture or any supplement thereto or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note of the applicable series affected thereby: (a) change the stated maturity date of any installment of principal of or interest, or reduce the principal amount of or the rate (or extend the time for payment) of interest, or any premium payable upon the redemption of any Notes; (b) reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity; (c) change the place or currency of payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest; (d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, the Notes; (e)
 
 
 
 
 
reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of such series of Outstanding Notes, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any amendment or waiver provided for in the Indenture; (f) modify any of the waiver provisions, except to increase any required percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Note of the series affected thereby; (g) cause any such Note to become subordinate in right of payment to any other Debt, except to the extent provided in the terms of such Note; or (h) impair such holder's right to require repurchase or conversion of the Notes on the terms provided therein.
The Holders of greater than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of U.S.$2,000 and any integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes that are of other authorized denominations.
Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Notes which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note for an equal aggregate amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by the Registrar (initially Wells Fargo Bank, National Association) in the registry books maintained by such Registrar in The City of New York, New York, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name a Note is registered as the owner for all purposes whether or not such Note be overdue and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
This Note is in the form of a Security in global form as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to this Note. If a successor Depositary for this Note is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for the Security in global form representing Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Note in exchange for this Note.
