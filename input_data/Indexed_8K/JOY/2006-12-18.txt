EBIT Performance Marches Higher and Incremental Profitability Remains Strong
LTM EBIT %
Quarterly Incremental Profitability
EBIT performance is in target range. Outstanding incremental performance again in Q4.  Fiscal 2007 results anticipated to be at low end of incremental target range with more challenging comparables, acquisition related non-cash charges and revenue mix contributing to this anticipation.
