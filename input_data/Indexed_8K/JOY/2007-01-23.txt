Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 22, 2007, Joy Global Inc. announced that James H. Woodward, Jr. has joined the company as executive vice president and will become chief financial officer replacing Donald C. Roof, who is retiring. Mr. Roof will continue in his current role to allow Mr. Woodward time to devote to an orientation program that will give him a solid grounding in the industry and Joy Global's business before assuming the CFO responsibilities.
Woodward, 54, joins Joy Global from JLG Industries, Inc., where he served as executive vice president and chief financial officer from 2000 until its recent acquisition. Prior to JLG, he was with Dana Corporation for 18 years and served in a series of increasingly senior financial and operational roles, including vice president and corporate controller. Woodward holds a BA degree from Michigan State University and began his career with Deloitte & Touche.
In connection with his appointment, Mr. Woodward was granted initial equity awards under the Joy Global Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, consisting of nonqualified stock options, performance awards and restricted stock units. The terms of each of these awards are materially consistent with the previously disclosed terms of similar awards granted to the company's executive officers.
In addition, the company anticipates that Mr. Woodward will enter into a change in control employment agreement with terms substantially identical to those contained in the form of change in control employment agreement filed as Exhibit 10(t) to the company's Form 10-K for the year ended November 1, 2003.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
