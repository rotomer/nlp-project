TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT
 
AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") by and between Joy Global Inc. (the Company") and James H. Woodward Jr. (the "Executive").
 
WHEREAS, the Executive has been employed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company; and
 
WHEREAS, by mutual agreement between the parties hereto, effective February 29, 2008 (the "Termination Date"), the Executive's employment with the Company terminates.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Executive, in consideration of the covenants herein set forth, agree as follows:
 
 
The Executive's employment is hereby terminated by the Company effective as of the Termination Date. By mutual agreement with the Company, the Executive hereby resigns, effective as of the Termination Date, from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and from all other positions the Executive may currently hold as an officer, member or director of any of the Company's subsidiaries or Affiliates. (For purposes of this Agreement, "Affiliate" shall mean a corporation or other entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.) The Executive shall sign and deliver to the Company such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Company to effect or reflect such resignations.
 
 
Regardless of whether the Executive signs this Agreement,
 
(a)
           
The Company shall pay to the Executive his current base monthly salary in equal semi-monthly installments through February 29, 2008, subject to required tax and other statutory withholding.
 
(b)
          
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that twenty (20) days of the Executive's vacation have been earned and are unused as of the Termination Date. The Executive shall be paid the sum of $35,692.31 less required tax and other statutory withholding, for such unused vacation days, which will be paid in the form of a payroll check no later than the next regular pay date following the execution of this agreement.
 
(c)
           
The Company will reimburse the Executive for any unreimbursed reasonable business expenses incurred by the Executive prior to the Termination Date, pursuant to the Company's reimbursement policies, following the Executive's presentation of an expense report to the Company.

In exchange for signing this Agreement, if the revocation period described in Section 9(b) has expired with no revocation occurring, and provided that the Executive is not in breach of any of his obligations under this Agreement, the Parties agree to the following consideration and payments:
 
(a)
          
Subject to required tax and other statutory withholding, the Company shall pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to $464,000.00, such amount payable in equal semi-monthly installments in accordance with the Company's regular payroll practices during the twelve (12) months immediately following the Termination Date
 
(b)
          
Following the Termination Date, the Company will continue, for the benefit of the Executive and his dependents, medical, dental and other health benefits on terms no less favorable than those provided to employees of the Company, through February 28, 2009, provided the Executive continues to make the contributions required of the Company's current employees. The Company will provide these benefits from the Termination Date through the Severance Period or until the Executive becomes eligible to receive health benefits from another employer, whichever occurs first, provided, however, that Executive's C.O.B.R.A. rights shall continue after the Termination Date in accordance with applicable laws.
 
(c)
       
The Company will as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this agreement pay the cost of providing the Executive with outplacement services.

(e)
          
The Executive will turn over to the Company possession of his leased vehicle no later than March 31, 2008. Reimbursement of all expenses related to the leased vehicle will cease as of that date or the date the vehicle is returned, whichever is earlier.
 
 
(a)
          
From and after the Termination Date, the Executive will refrain from taking actions or making statements, written or oral, which defame the goodwill or reputation of the Company and any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates (the "Company Entities") and their trustees, officers, security holders, partners, agents and former and current employees and directors or which are intended to, or may be reasonably expected to, adversely affect the morale of the employees of any of the Company Entities; provided, however, that the Executive shall be permitted to make any truthful statements to the extent required by applicable law.
 
(b)
          
From and after the Termination Date, the Company will refrain from taking actions or making statements, written or oral, which defame the goodwill or reputation of the Executive or which are intended to, or may be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Executive; provided, however, that the Company shall be permitted to make any truthful statements to the extent required by applicable law. All requests made to the Company regarding the Executive's employment will be

directed to Dennis Winkleman, Executive Vice President, Human Resources.
 
 
(a)
           
The Executive affirms that he has returned to the Company all Company-owned equipment and all forms of Company Information (as defined below), including client lists, files, software, records, computer access codes and instruction manuals, which he has in his possession and agrees not to keep any copies of Company Information. The Executive affirms his obligations to keep all Company Information confidential and not to disclose it to any third party in the future. The term "Company Information" means: (i) confidential information generated by the Company including information received from third parties about the Company under confidential conditions, and (ii) other technical, marketing, business or financial information, or information relating to personnel or former personnel of the Company, the use or disclosure of which might reasonably be construed to be materially contrary to the interest of the Company;
provided
,
however
, that the term "Company Information" shall not include any information that is or became generally known or available to the public other than as a direct result of a breach of this Section by the Executive or any action by the Executive prior to the Termination Date which would have been a breach of the Executive's obligations to the Company in effect at such time. The Executive hereby reaffirms his obligations under the Company's Worldwide Business Conduct Policy, the Stock Option Agreements to which he is a party, and the Employee Proprietary Rights and Confidentiality Agreement. The Executive shall have the right to remove from the offices of the Company any of his personal belongings that do not constitute Company Information. The Executive may disclose Company Information to the extent required by law or regulation;
provided
, that the Executive shall provide the Company with reasonable written notice (if possible no less than 20 days' written notice) of any required disclosure. In the event the Company objects to such disclosure, the Executive agrees that he will not provide any Company Information that is the subject of such objection, but rather will refer the requesting entity to the Company unless he is subject to a court or administrative agency order to provide the Company Information. The Executive shall keep the contents of this Agreement confidential except as required by law,
provided
that the Executive may disclose this Agreement to his accountants, attorneys, and immediate family members.
 
(b)
         
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedy at law for any breach of the Executive's obligations under this Section 5 would be inadequate and agrees and consents that temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in any proceeding which may be brought to enforce any provision of this Section without the necessity of proof of actual damage. With respect to any provision of this Section 5 finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such court shall have jurisdiction to reform this Agreement or any provision hereof so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the parties agree to abide by such court's determination.
 
 
The Executive retains all rights existing as of the Termination Date under the terms of the Joy Global Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, the Nonqualified Stock Option Agreements executed by the Executive, and any other Equity Agreements executed by the Executive and in effect, as those rights may be established or modified by the Executive's termination of employment. For purposes of any
 
3
 
 
Equity Agreements, the Executive's termination of employment is "without cause".
 
 
The Executive agrees that there are no monies, benefits, or other form of remuneration whatsoever due or owing to him, except as set forth in this Agreement and except for benefits under any employee pension benefit plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (including the Company's 401(k) plan and tax-qualified pension plan).
 
 
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed in any way as an admission by any of the parties of any act, practice or policy of discrimination or breach of contract either in violation of applicable law or otherwise.
 
 
(a)
           
In consideration of the payments and benefits set forth in Sections 3 (a), (b) and (c) of this Agreement, the Executive, for himself, his heirs, administrators, representatives, executors, successors and assigns (collectively "Releasors") does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge, with prejudice, the Company Entities and their trustees, officers, security holders, partners, agents, former and current employees, officers, and directors, including without limitation all persons acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them and any insurers of any of these (collectively, "Releasees"), from any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, remedies, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of the Executive's employment by the Company, known or unknown, whether in law or equity and whether arising under federal (including bankruptcy), state or local law and in particular including any claim for discrimination based upon race, color, ethnicity, sex, age (including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 as amended by the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act (the "ADEA Release")), national origin, religion, disability, sexual preference, or any other unlawful criterion or circumstance, or other federal, state, or local law which regulates any aspect of the employment relationship, which the Releasors had, now have or may have in the future against each or any of the Releasees from the beginning of the world until the date of the execution of this Agreement as set forth on the final page hereof. This release also includes a release by the Executive of any known or unknown claims arising out of his employment by the Company, whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, actions for wrongful discharge, intentional infliction of emotional distress and/or libel or slander that have accrued as of the date this Agreement is executed, but does not waive claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended by the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, that may arise after the date this Agreement is executed
.
 
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that if he or any other Releasor should hereafter make any claim or demand or commence or threaten to commence any action, claim or proceeding against the Releasees with respect to any cause, matter or thing which is the subject of this Section 9(a), this Agreement may be raised as a complete bar to any such action, claim or proceeding. It is the intention of the parties hereto that this waiver and release be as broad as the law permits.

This Section 9(a) does not apply to (i) any claims for defense or indemnification that the Executive may have under the law, governing documents of the Company or any Company Entities or against any directors and officers liability insurance coverage which covers occurrences arising during the Executive's tenure as an officer and/or director of the Company or any Company Entities, or (ii) any benefits payable to the Executive under any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA (including the Company's 401(k) plan and tax-qualified pension plan).
 
(b)
          
The Executive affirms that prior to the execution of this Agreement and the waiver and release in Section 9(a), the Executive was advised by the Company, in writing by this Section, to consult with an attorney of the Executive's choice to the extent he believed necessary to discuss all aspects of this Agreement, and that the Executive was given at least twenty-one (21) days to consider executing this Agreement, including the ADEA Release in Section 9(a). The parties agree that any agreed-upon changes to the Company's initial offer do not restart the twenty-one day consideration period. The Executive has seven (7) days following his execution of this Agreement to revoke the ADEA Release, by giving written notice of the Executive's revocation to the Company's Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Dennis Winkleman, by 3:00 p.m. on the eighth day following his execution of this Agreement.
