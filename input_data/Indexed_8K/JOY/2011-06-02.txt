, a worldwide leader in high-productivity mining solutions, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Milwaukee, WI  June 2, 2011  Joy Global Inc.
(NASDAQ: JOYG)
Second quarter bookings increased 46 percent to $1.5 billion and net sales increased 19 percent to $1.1 billion, compared to the same period last year. Operating income of $234 million was 22 percent of sales, compared to operating income of $181 million, or 20 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.  Net income for the second quarter was $162 million or $1.52 per fully diluted share, compared to $120 million or $1.15 per share in the second quarter of last year.
We had another outstanding quarter, reaching record levels of performance in order bookings, shipments, operating profit margins and earnings per share, said Mike Sutherlin, President and Chief Executive Officer.  The balance in our performance across this range of metrics is more satisfying than the records, and it demonstrates our drive to improve all areas of our business through our Operational Excellence programs.  In addition, we continue to see solid fundamentals based on the capital investment decisions of our customers.  They continue to move forward with mine expansion plans based on the strong belief that current capacity must be increased significantly to keep up with demand growth, even if the demand pace moderates.  And finally, the pending acquisition of LeTourneau will add to our growth prospects by giving us the mining industrys leading wheel loader to compliment our electric rope shovels and from its drilling products that will benefit from the recent strong start to a major construction phase for new drilling rigs.  As a result, we are very pleased with our second quarter for both the results we delivered and the steps we have taken to execute our business strategy.
Second Quarter Operating Results
Bookings increased by $477 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 over the prior year quarter and were up $297 million sequentially from the first quarter.   New orders for original equipment were 79 percent higher in the second quarter than they were a year ago, while aftermarket bookings were up 22 percent.  The second quarter bookings included a benefit of $131 million from changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Australian dollar.  The foreign exchange benefit was $79 million for original equipment and $52 million for aftermarket.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second quarter bookings in the underground equipment business were up $223 million from the prior year quarter.  Original equipment orders increased by $149 million, due primarily to longwall equipment orders in Australia and the continued strong demand for room and pillar equipment in the U.S.   Aftermarket bookings increased $74 million in the second quarter, due to strong parts and component orders across most markets and an increase in service labor bookings in Australia.  Machine rebuilds were down from the exceptionally high levels of last year, but continue the trend of long-term growth in aftermarket rebuilds.
In the surface equipment business, bookings increased by $272 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Original equipment orders more than doubled, increasing by $205 million, and aftermarket bookings increased by $67 million.  New equipment orders for electric mining shovels and blasthole drills for use in mining coal, copper and iron ore were received from customers in North America, South America, Russia and South Africa.  The increase in aftermarket bookings was due to strong demand for replacement parts across most geographic regions.
The backlog increased by $462 million to $2.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. The original equipment backlog increased $371 million and the aftermarket backlog was up $91 million.
Net sales of $1.1 billion for the second quarter were an increase of 19 percent, or $167 million, from the same period last year.  Original equipment sales increased 10 percent and aftermarket sales were up 24 percent over the prior year quarter.
 
Net sales in the underground equipment business increased 19 percent in the second quarter to $648 million.  Original equipment sales were up 8 percent, due to increased room and pillar and longwall equipment shipments in the U.S.  Aftermarket sales increased 28 percent as a result of higher parts sales in the U.S. and China, and from higher rebuild sales in the U.S. and Eurasia.
Net sales in the surface equipment business increased 15 percent to $440 million in the second quarter.  Original equipment sales were up 12 percent and aftermarket sales increased 16 percent.  The new surface equipment sales were to customers in the copper and coal producing regions of South America, Australia and Russia.
Operating income increased by $54 million to $234 million in the second quarter.  Operating margins improved from 20.1 percent in the second quarter of last year to 22.0 percent in the same period this year.  The increase in the operating margin was due to positive price realization, improved overhead absorption and favorable product mix, which included a higher proportion of aftermarket sales.  These benefits were partially offset by higher product development and selling and administrative expenses, as well as higher costs of raw materials.
Compared to a year ago, the weaker U.S. dollar added $22 million to net sales and $5 million to operating income in the second quarter.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent a year ago.  The lower second-quarter tax rate resulted from the benefit of tax planning strategies implemented this year, partially offset by a higher proportion of sales in regions with higher tax rates.  The tax rate is expected to be between 31 and 32 percent for the full year.
Net income for the second quarter increased 34 percent to $162 million, from $120 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010.  Compared to last years $1.15 per share, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.52, on a 1.8 million increase in weighted average shares outstanding.
Cash provided by operations was $257 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $108 million for the same period last year.  Increases in net income and cash from advance payments were partially offset by an increase in inventories.  Cash provided by advance payments was $205 million higher than in the prior year second quarter, due to the higher level of new orders.  The increase in inventories in the second quarter was due to the planned production schedules for the balance of the fiscal year, and strategies to improve aftermarket service levels.
Capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter, compared to $18 million last year.  Capital expenditures are expected to be $130 million for the full year compared to $75 million last year.
 
Market Outlook
Mining industry fundamentals remain solid even if the outlook is for slower economic growth.  There is limited excess mine capacity today, and expansion programs are still behind after being on hold for most of 2009 and into 2010.  Mining companies also have to compensate for declining ore grades and for routine production outages from weather, geology and labor issues.  As a result, the mining industry continues to deploy record levels of capital expenditures for mine expansion projects.  The Companys increasing order rates for original equipment over the past several quarters are an indication that those projects are progressively moving to equipment selection.  In addition, projects continue to move through the planning and permitting phases, and these projects will support longer term demand for mining equipment.
The seaborne coal markets continue to be dominated by the emerging economies, and by China and India in particular.  Power generation in China during the first four months of this year is up 12 percent from last year, and steel production is up 7 percent.   Both power generators and steel makers have been reluctant to buy coal at prices that were elevated by the Australian flooding earlier this year, and therefore coal stockpiles have been depleted.    The national average of coal stockpiles at power plants in China reached a yearly low of 13 to 14 days of supply in April.  These low stockpiles are occurring at a seasonal period in which stockpiles are normally replenished going into the summer cooling season, and this is creating concerns about growing power shortages this summer.  In addition, drought conditions in China are reducing hydro generation by 15 to 20 percent, and this should increase coal burn for replacement power generation.  Although domestic coal production is up 11 percent year to date in China, this increase is in line with consumption increases and is not enough to reduce imports.  As a result, imports are expected to increase for the remainder of the year.  There was some evidence of that in April, with coal imports into China up 23 percent from the prior month.

Indias demand for seaborne coal also remains strong.   India plans to double its rate of growth in power generating capacity between 2010 and 2012, with 78 GW planned to come on line during this period.   India imported 70 million tonnes of coal last year, and this is expected to grow to 140 million tonnes by 2012.
Japan is now an additional factor in seaborne coal demand.  The damage to nuclear plants in Japan as a result of the earthquake has caused the indefinite shutdown of roughly 7 GW of electricity generation.  An additional 6 GW of coal-fired generation is already planned to come on line between 2011 and 2020, and it is likely that previously shuttered coal plants will be reinstated to replace the lost generation from nuclear power.   Supply constraints will add further pressure to the seaborne markets.  The Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia are constructing 35 GW of new coal-fired power generating capacity, and this will redirect more of their seaborne capacity to domestic consumption.
 
Coal demand in the U.S. market has been improving since early 2010, and the outlook continues to be positive.  First quarter 2011 production was up nearly 2 percent over 2010 on recovery in industrial sector electricity usage and a 15 percent increase in export volumes.  U.S. coal exports were 81 million tons in 2010, and are expected to reach 100 million tons or more in 2011.  In addition, two U.S. coal producers are investing in western port capacity that will enable Powder River Basin coal to access the Pacific seaborne market.  U.S. coal stockpiles are down from their peak in 2009, but remain above the average of the past five years.  However, this is not adversely affecting pricing, with prices in all markets up from the first of the year.
 
Copper fundamentals are among the strongest of all commodities.  Demand has broadened with recovery in the industrial sector of the developed economies, but China remains the major consumer of global demand.  China copper imports have slowed this year, but inventories at the Shanghai Futures Exchange have dropped by half, which indicates that China is going through another cycle of de-stocking.  China has a history of moving between periods of de-stocking and re-stocking, and it is expected that re-stocking will return in the second half of this year.  In addition, Chinas multi-year program to build out the electricity grid in the western provinces is expected to add 20 percent to its copper demand, and overall China demand is expected to grow 7 percent this year.   As a result of longer term demand expectations, major capacity expansion projects are underway in most of the main copper producing regions, running from Chile in the south to Alaska in the north.
 
China imports of iron ore are up 9 percent in the first four months of this year, consistent with the increase in steel production in the country.  Iron ore supply is still constrained by previous export restrictions out of India and by rail access out of the Pilbara region in Western Australia, and this is keeping spot prices in the $170 to $180 per ton range, up 38 percent from a low point in July of 2010.  Major iron ore capacity expansion projects are underway in Western Australia, Brazil and Southern Africa.  In North America, the iron ore producers are working at full capacity and continue in-pit expansions of existing mines.

High oil prices are providing support for expansion projects in the oil sands of Alberta, Canada.  The activity has recently been largely brown field expansions, but the current producers are beginning to reactivate some projects that were previously put on hold.
 
In summary, favorable pricing and a strong long-term outlook continue to drive the broad-based expansion of key commodities, which translates into increased spending by mining companies.  Capital expenditures by mining companies directly correlate with original equipment bookings for Joy Global.
 
Le Tourneau Acquisition
 
On May 16, 2011, Joy Global announced it has entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. from Rowan Companies, Inc. for $1.1 billion in cash.  Le Tourneau designs, builds and supports equipment for the mining and oil and gas drilling industries.  This transaction is expected to close during our third quarter.
 
Company Outlook
Our second quarter order bookings and the industry fundamentals continue to support our view that we are in the early stages of a multi-year expansion, said Sutherlin.   Mining capital expenditure budgets are at record levels, and customers are continuing to execute these expansion programs.  As a result, our list of qualified prospects remains at historically high levels despite the record number of machines we booked this quarter and this underscores longer term support for equipment demand.  We have an extremely good view of active mine expansion projects through our early work directly with customers for pre-engineering and project planning.  However, the timing of equipment orders can vary by months or quarters due to delays in a number of enabling activities, such as permitting or infrastructure development.  With this in mind, the particularly strong orders this quarter should be considered in the context of the very lumpy nature of original equipment.
We are very pleased with the strong performance in our aftermarket for both bookings and shipments.  The gains in the aftermarket are correlated to mine production rates, and are another indicator of the positive industry fundamentals.  These gains also validate our strategy to convert the aftermarket from transactions to Life Cycle Management programs.  Not only do we get better capture rates with our aftermarket programs, but they result in higher machine reliability for our customers.
Our Operational Excellence programs continue to add value to our business.  We have reduced the build times for our machines, and this is allowing us to maintain competitive order-to-delivery lead times despite the strong booking rates.   This is also allowing us to convert orders into revenues faster.
 
As a result of the strong market fundamentals and improved throughput from Operational Excellence, we are able to raise our guidance for the full year and now expect revenues to be $4.1 to $4.3 billion, up from $4.0 to $4.2 billion previously.  We expect to get similar operating leverage on the incremental revenues, and therefore are raising our guidance for fully diluted earnings per share, which we now expect to be $5.30 to $5.60, up from $5.10 to $5.40 previously.   This guidance does not include costs related to the LeTourneau acquisition.  LeTourneau is expected to close by the end of June, and it will be immediately accretive excluding transaction costs and the higher level of purchase accounting charges typically experienced in the first 12 months, said Sutherlin.
