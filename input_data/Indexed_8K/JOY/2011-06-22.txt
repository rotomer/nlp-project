On June 16, 2011, Joy Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (Joy Global), entered into a credit agreement among Joy Global, as Borrower, certain of its domestic subsidiaries, as Guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and the 1enders party thereto (the Credit Agreement).  The Credit Agreement, which matures June 16, 2016, provides for a term loan commitment of $500 million. The Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
The Credit Agreement contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the term loan provisions of Joy Globals existing credit agreement, dated as of October 27, 2010, as amended (the 2010 Credit Agreement).  Under the Credit Agreement, Eurodollar Rate Loans will bear interest for a period from the applicable borrowing date until a date one, two, three or six months thereafter, as selected by Joy Global, at the corresponding Eurodollar rate plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of Joy Global and Base Rate Loans will bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A., as its prime rate, and (c) a daily rate equal to the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus (ii) a margin that varies according to the credit rating of Joy Global.
Joy Global utilized the $500 million commitment under the Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. (LeTourneau) from Rowan Companies, Inc. (Rowan) (as discussed below), to pay costs and expenses associated therewith and for general corporate purposes.  In order to obtain loans under the Credit Agreement, certain representations and warranties made by Joy Global and each Guarantor at the time the Credit Agreement was executed also must be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of any credit extension.  So long as any amount is outstanding under the Credit Agreement, Joy Global must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of Joy Global and the Guarantors, other than certain permitted liens, (ii) maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 2.50 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter of Joy Global, and (iii) restrictions on certain fundamental changes as specified in the Credit Agreement.
The failure to satisfy any of the Credit Agreements covenants or the occurrence of other specified events that constitute an event of default could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations of Joy Global.  The events of default include, but are not limited to (i) the failure of Joy Global or any Guarantor to pay indebtedness under the Credit Agreement when due, (ii) the breach of certain covenants and representations and warranties under the Credit Agreement, subject in certain cases to cure periods, (iii) certain insolvency events, judgments or decrees against Joy Global or any of the Guarantors, (iv) certain final judgments or orders for the payment of money entered against Joy Global, (v) certain events with respect to Joy Globals pension plan (vi) certain cross-defaults to other indebtedness and (vii) a change of control (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the lenders under the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have various relationships with Joy Global and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including investment banking, commercial banking, advisory, cash management, custody and trust services, for which they have received customary fees, and may do so again in the future.
On June 21, 2011, Joy Global Inc. exercised its option under the 2010 Credit Agreement to increase the aggregate revolving commitment available to Joy Global thereunder by an additional $200 million. Joy Global did not draw upon this amount in connection with closing its acquisition of LeTourneau and intends to use the proceeds of loans drawn under the expansion of the 2010 Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.
 
 
 
 
 
On June 22, 2011, Joy Global completed the acquisition of LeTourneau from Rowan, in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated May 13, 2011, between Joy Global and Rowan (the Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Joy Global purchased from Rowan all of the outstanding shares of LeTourneau for an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion, subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement.  The purchase price was funded in part through available cash resources and the Credit Agreement, as discussed above.
On June 22, 2011, Joy Global issued a press release announcing the completion of the acquisition of LeTourneau.  A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
(a) Financial statements of businesses acquired.
Joy Global intends to file the financial statements of LeTourneau by amendment no later than 71 calendar days after the date this Current Report is required to be filed.

(b)           (i)            .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Status of Lenders
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(f)           .  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension, compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN  June 22, 2011  Joy Global Inc. (Joy Global)(NASDAQ: JOYG), a worldwide leader in high-productivity mining solutions, has completed the acquisition of LeTourneau Technologies Inc. (LeTourneau) from Rowan Companies, Inc. (Rowan) (NYSE: RDC) for $1.1 billion in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 13, 2011.
LeTourneau is a world leader in the manufacture of large capacity wheel loaders for the surface mining market as well as jack-up rigs and ancillary equipment for the oil and gas drilling industries.
Michael Sutherlin, CEO Joy Global, said, The acquisition of LeTourneau brings two very strong business platforms to Joy Global.  LeTourneaus wheel loaders are the largest and most fuel efficient in the industry and their complementary application to our electric mining shovels will deliver significant synergies.  LeTourneau is also a leading brand in oil and gas drilling rig equipment and design and this business is leveraged to an emerging demand for higher specification rigs.  We welcome the people of LeTourneau to Joy Global, and look forward to working with them to capture the opportunities that come with these two businesses.
Matt Ralls, President and CEO Rowan, said We are delighted to have achieved this combination and are confident it will create additional opportunities for LeTourneau and its employees.  I extend my thanks and appreciation to both the Joy Global and Rowan/LeTourneau teams who made the transaction happen.
