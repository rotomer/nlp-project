On July 11, 2011, Joy Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (Joy Global), and its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Newco Hong Kong 123 Limited (the Subsidiary), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Initial Agreement) with TJCC Holdings Limited (the Seller), a corporation controlled by The Jordan Company, L.P., to acquire 534.8 million shares of common stock of International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. (IMM), a Hong Kong listed designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in China.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement (as hereinafter defined), Joy Global will acquire approximately 41% of the outstanding common stock of IMM from the Seller (the Purchase) for a cash purchase price of HK$8.50 per share, or total cash consideration of approximately $585 million (U.S.) at present exchange rates.  In connection with the review of the Initial Agreement by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC), Joy Global and the Seller entered into an Amended and Restated Share Purchase Agreement on July 14, 2011 (the Amended and Restated Agreement), which modified the circumstances constituting a material adverse change under the Initial Agreement.  References in this filing to the Agreement refer to both the Initial Agreement and the Amended and Restated Agreement.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of approval from the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) of the Peoples Republic of China and other customary closing conditions.  Upon receipt of approval from MOFCOM, the Subsidiary will be required to make an unconditional cash tender offer pursuant to Rule 26.1 of the Hong Kong Takeovers Code for the remaining outstanding IMM shares and options to purchase IMM shares (the Tender Offer).  The Subsidiary intends to offer to purchase approximately 765.3 million shares, representing approximately 59% of IMMs outstanding shares, for HK$8.50 per share, as well as options to purchase approximately 17.9 million shares for the amount by which HK$8.50 exceeds the exercise price of each option.  If all of the remaining shares and options are purchased under the Tender Offer, the total cash consideration of the Tender Offer will be approximately $840 million at present exchange rates.  The Tender Offer will be subject to the terms and conditions to be set out in the offer document, including the valid tender and acceptance of the number of shares necessary to result in Subsidiary becoming the majority shareholder of IMM. The terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and the offering document are subject to approval by the SFC, and following such approval the offering document will be made available on Joy Globals website.
IMM designs and manufactures underground longwall coal mining equipment, including roadheaders, longwall shearing machines, armored-face conveyors and electric control systems for the Chinese mining market.  In addition to manufacturing original equipment, IMM provides aftermarket parts and services through a broad network of service and warehouse locations.
This description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Initial Agreement and the Amended and Restated Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively and are incorporated herein by reference.  The Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and covenants of the parties that were made for purposes of the Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties.  The representations and warranties have been made for the principal purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those generally applicable to investors.  Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, or IMM.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Agreement, and may not be fully reflected in Joy Globals subsequent public disclosures to the extent such information is not required to be disclosed.
 
 
 
In connection with entry into the Agreement, on July 11, 2011, Joy Global entered into a $1.5 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility (the Bridge Loan Agreement) among Joy Global, as Borrower, certain of its domestic subsidiaries, as Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as Administrative Agent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (Goldman Sachs) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch), as Syndication Agents, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners (collectively, the Bridge Lenders).  The Bridge Loan Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The following description of the Bridge Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bridge Loan Agreement.
Under the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Bridge Lenders have severally agreed to make unsecured loans (the Bridge Loans) of up to $1.5 billion in the aggregate (i) in one draw, up to a maximum of $650 million, on the closing date of the Agreement to pay the consideration due thereunder and related fees and expenses and (ii) in multiple draws, of no less than $10 million each, at any time during the period beginning on the commencement of the Tender Offer and ending on the date on which all amounts payable with respect to the Tender Offer have been paid (the Offer Availability Period).  Any unused commitments of the Bridge Lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Agreement is terminated without the Purchase having been consummated, (ii) March 11, 2012, unless the Purchase is consummated on or prior to such date, (iii) the date that is 90 days following the 41% Purchase Date, as defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement, (iv) the date on which all amounts payable by Joy Global pursuant to the Tender Offer have been paid, (v) the date on which the commitments are terminated, reduced or prepaid by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Loan Agreement, and (vi) May 11, 2012.
The interest rate payable by Joy Global on funds borrowed under the Bridge Loan Agreement is, at its election, based on either (i) the corresponding Eurodollar rate or (ii) the highest of (a) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced by JPMorgan in New York, New York, as its prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (c) a daily rate equal to the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each of cases (i) and (ii), a margin that varies according to the credit rating of Joy Global.  Eurodollar rate loans will bear interest for a period from the applicable borrowing date until a date one, two, three or six months thereafter, as selected by Joy Global and base rate loans will bear interest from the applicable borrowing date through the end of the next calendar quarter. The Bridge Loan Agreement also requires Joy Global to pay certain customary fees and expenses. The Bridge Loans, once repaid by Joy Global, may not be re-borrowed.
In order to obtain loans under the Bridge Loan Agreement, certain representations and warranties made by Joy Global and each Guarantor at the time the Bridge Loan Agreement was executed also must be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of any borrowing.  So long as any amount is outstanding under the Bridge Loan Agreement, Joy Global must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of Joy Global and the Guarantors, other than certain permitted liens, (ii) maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 2.50 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter of Joy Global, and (iii) restrictions on certain fundamental changes as specified in the Bridge Loan Agreement.
The failure to satisfy any of the Bridge Loan Agreements covenants or the occurrence of other specified events that constitute an event of default could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations of Joy Global.  The events of default include, but are not limited to (i) the failure of Joy Global or any Guarantor to pay indebtedness under the Bridge Loan Agreement when due, (ii) the breach of certain covenants and representations and warranties under the Bridge Loan Agreement, subject in certain cases to cure periods, (iii) certain insolvency events, judgments or decrees against Joy Global or any of the Guarantors, (iv) certain final judgments or orders for the payment of money entered against Joy Global, (v) certain events with respect to Joy Globals pension plan (vi) certain cross-defaults to other indebtedness and (vii) a change of control (as defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement).
 
 
 
The maturity date of the Bridge Loan Agreement is the first anniversary of the date on which Bridge Loans are first made under the agreement, at which time all outstanding Bridge Loans, if any, will become due and payable.  Joy Global is required to prepay the Bridge Loans with, and any unused commitments of the Bridge Lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement will be reduced by, the net proceeds received from certain asset sales, certain recoveries for property losses, and certain new debt or equity issuances by Joy Global.
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, the lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement or their affiliates have various relationships with Joy Global and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including investment banking, commercial banking, advisory, cash management, custody and trust services, for which they have received customary fees, and may do so again in the future.
In connection with entry into the Amended and Restated Agreement, on July 14, 2011 Joy Global entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Bridge Loan Agreement to make conforming changes relating to closing of the Agreement.  Amendment No. 1 to the Bridge Loan Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Seller shall not be liable in respect of a Warranty Claim to the extent that it relates to any liability or obligation on the part of a Wider Group Company:
 
 
 
 
 
The Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser against, and agrees to hold it harmless from, any and all losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser arising out of any breach by Seller of a Fundamental Warranty.
 
 
Subject to Completion, and subject to clause 8.7 (but without prejudice to clause 2.4), the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and Purchaser Parent for the breach by Seller of any Fundamental Warranties, shall be to assert a Warranty Claim.
 
 
The Seller shall not be liable in respect of any Warranty Claim unless the amount of all Warranty Claims exceeds 2 per cent. of the Purchase Price (it being agreed that in the event such threshold is reached and exceeded, the Seller will only be liable for losses in excess of such amount).

The Purchaser and the Seller will proceed, in good faith, to agree on the amount of such Warranty Claim.

The court costs and reasonable and documented fees and expenses, including reasonable and documented attorneys fees, incurred by the Purchaser and the Seller in connection with any such enforcement proceeding shall be borne by the Purchaser and the Seller in inverse proportion to their relative success in such proceeding.
 
 
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any Warranty Claim, and the Seller shall not be liable for such claim, unless the Purchaser shall have given notice in writing to Seller of the claim no later than the end of twelve months after the Completion Date.  Thereafter, the Seller shall not be under any obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of this agreement or relating to the Shares.

Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; that (i) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) in the case of any such Loan made by an Affiliate of such Lender, such Lender shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 or 2.14 than it would have received had the Lender, and not such Affiliate, funded such Loan, and such Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 with respect to any payments on or with respect to such Loan unless such Affiliate complies with Section 2.14(e) as if it were the Lender.

Any such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in the form of hereto and signed by the Borrower.  Such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
.  Request for Borrowing.  
Exhibit B
 
29
 
(i)             the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
(ii)            the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)           whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
(iv)           in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period; and
(v)           the location and number of the Borrowers account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.04.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  Promptly following receipt of the Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
Section 2.04(a) Each Lender shall make the Loans to be made by it hereunder on the proposed dates thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by (x) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, 12:00 noon, New York City time and (y) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, 3:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the Borrowing Request.
.  Funding Borrowings.  
(b)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of a Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Section 2.05(a) The Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
.  Interest Elections.  
(b)           To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in the form of hereto and signed by the Borrower.
Exhibit C
(c)           Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:

(ii)            the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)           whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv)           if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.

(d)           Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)           If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing without the prior consent of the Required Lenders and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

(c)           The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.
(d)           The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima facie
provided
(e)           Any Lender may request, through the Administrative Agent, that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender through the Administrative Agent a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each such promissory note, a ).  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such Note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
Note
Section 2.08(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.06, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.06.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.

(b)           the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount shall have been determined, delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of such payment or liability absent manifest error.

(f)           If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Assignment and Assumption would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA either because of an election under Section 1471(b)(3) of the Code or if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14(f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)           Each Lender agrees that, before making a demand under this Section 2.14, it shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates if the making of such a designation or assignment will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any additional amounts that would otherwise thereafter accrue and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, require such Lender to incur a cost or expense, or legal or regulatory disadvantage, determined by such Lender to be material.  Upon any such change in any Applicable Lending Office or assignment, such Lender shall provide or cause to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the appropriate form specified in Section 2.14(e).
(h)           If the Borrower pays any additional amount or indemnity payment pursuant to this Section 2.14 with respect to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax on account of such payment; that the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund would cause adverse tax consequences to it or (ii) no such refund is available under applicable laws.  In the event that the Administrative Agent or such Lender receives such a refund, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall promptly pay to the Borrower an amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.14(h) shall require the Administrative Agent or such Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any net tax benefit or its determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.14(h) to the Borrower or any other party.

(i)           Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes; that, in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower, such steps shall not subject the Borrower to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Borrower in any material respect.

Section 2.15(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent, except that payments pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 or 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
.  Payment Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  
(b)           If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c)           If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)           If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.15(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
Section 2.16(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 2.12(f), then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.14, as the case may be, in the future or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 2.12(f) and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  
(b)           If any Lender (i) requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to make a payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, or (iii) does not consent to any amendment, waiver, consent, supplement or other modification of any Loan Document requested by the Borrower that requires the consent of each of the Lenders affected thereby, or of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders and, in each case, such amendment, waiver, consent, supplement or other modification is consented to by the Required Lenders; then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04, with the Borrower or the replacement Lender paying the processing and recording fee), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (w) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent to such assignment, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) (in the case of a Defaulting Lender, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any amount to which such Defaulting Lender is not entitled in accordance with Section 2.17), (y) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14 such assignment will result in a reduction in or elimination of such compensation or payments in the future and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, such assignee consents to such amendment, waiver, consent, supplement or other modification.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this Section 2.16(b) may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto.

(c)           any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 8 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall, unless the Administrative Agent determines that such application entails a material risk of violation of applicable law or order, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; that, if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 or 3.03 (as applicable) were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

(c)           the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents, such Swap Contracts or such Treasury Management Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
(d)           any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or any Treasury Management Agreement between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents, such Swap Contracts or such Treasury Management Agreements, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.
Section 4.03
.  Reinstatement.

IMM is a leading designer and manufacturer of underground longwall coal mining equipment in China. It has strong domestic market positions in roadheaders and longwall shearing machines, and is growing the share of its armored-face conveyor and electric control systems businesses. In addition to original equipment, IMM provides aftermarket parts and services through a broad network of service and warehouse locations.  IMM's calendar 2010 financial results had revenues of approximately RMB 1,943 million (USD 299 million) and Adjusted EBITDA* of RMB 585 million (USD 90 million).
A core part of our business strategy has been to position ourselves for the high growth of the emerging markets, and the investment in IMM is a major step in the execution of that strategy, said Mike Sutherlin, President and Chief Executive Officer.  The China coal market is large and diverse, and must be accessed with a multi-dimensional strategy.  While the major mines generally use globally sourced equipment, a larger number of mines rely on local Chinese mining equipment manufacturers.  Leadership in the China market requires strong positions specific to each segment, and IMM is an established market leader in the local market with premier products for longwall shearing machines and road headers.  IMM is a very strong complement to our Joy Mining and P&H businesses, and gives us leading positions in each of the major segments of the China market.

Forward Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "indicate," "may be," "objective," "plan," "predict," "will," "will be," and the like are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on our current expectations and are made only as of the date of this press release. In addition, certain market outlook information is based on third-party sources that we cannot independently verify, but that we believe reliable. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect new information. We cannot assure you the projected results or events will be achieved. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, they are subject to change at any time. Such risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to: (i) risks of international operations, including currency fluctuations, (ii) risks associated with acquisitions, (iii) risks associated with indebtedness, (iv) risks associated with the cyclical nature of our business, (v) risks associated with the international and U.S. coal and copper commodity markets, (vi) risks associated with access to major purchased items, such as steel, castings, forgings and bearings, and (vii) risks associated with labor markets and other risks, uncertainties and cautionary factors set forth in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release "EBITDA", which is not recognized as a financial measurement under GAAP accounting rules, is used as a performance measure. Management uses EBITDA and other operating metrics as tools to evaluate the profitability of IMMs operations and the effectiveness of its various initiatives. EBITDA is calculated as net profit before taxes, plus depreciation, amortization and net finance costs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes material charges related to IMMs Global Offering in 2010 as well as its receipt of a waiver of taxes for periods prior to formation of the IMM. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA included in this press release provides useful information to investors regarding IMMs results of operations because it assists in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of IMM's business. Presenting Adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons of companies within the same or similar industries by backing out differences caused by variations in capital structure, taxation and depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. These measures provide an assessment of controllable operating expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance. These measures also provide an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed. Furthermore, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it provides important insight into IMMs profitability trends, and allows management and investors to analyze operating results with and without the impact of depreciation and amortization, interest and income tax expense and material related to IMMs Global Offering in 2010 as well as its receipt of a waiver of taxes for the periods prior to formation of IMM. Accordingly, these metrics measure financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the operational cost structure and expenses of the business. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies, many of which present an EBITDA measure when reporting their results. Although Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of this business, the use of Adjusted EBITDA is limited because they do not include certain material costs, such as depreciation, amortization and interest, necessary to operate the business. The reconciliation between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and net income is disclosed to compensate for this limitation. While net income is used as a significant measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, when presented along with net income, provides balanced disclosure which, for the reasons set forth above, is useful to investors in evaluating operating performance and profitability. Adjusted EBITDA included in this press release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measure of IMMs performance.
