Exhibit 99.1
News release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $0.69 per share, in the first quarter of 2003, compared with net income of $982 million, or $0.48 per share, in the first quarter of 2002 and a net loss of $387 million, or ($0.20) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. The return on average common equity was 13%.
New York, April 16, 2003
In 2002, reported results were lower than results on an operating basis, which excluded merger and restructuring costs incurred in each quarter and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, separately disclosed litigation-related charges. On this basis, operating earnings were $1.15 billion, or $0.57 per share, in the first quarter of 2002 and $730 million, or $0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2002.
"We are encouraged by first quarter results. Sharp revenue growth in the Investment Bank and Chase Financial Services, combined with meaningful improvement in credit quality and the benefits of our expense initiatives, produced stronger earnings," said William B. Harrison, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While we continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we remain committed to serving our clients, controlling our expenses and managing our risks."
Highlights for the first quarter of 2003:

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
JPMorgan Partners
JPMorgan Partners generated an operating loss of $224 million for the quarter compared to operating losses of $252 million in the first quarter of 2002 and $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Expenses
were $5.54 billion, up 9% from the first quarter of 2002. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation expenses, resulting from higher revenue-related incentive accruals and increased costs related to stock-based compensation and pension expenses. Severance and related costs in the first quarter of 2003 were $171 million and included real estate related write-offs of $78 million. Non-compensation related expenses, excluding the real estate related write-offs, were flat compared to the first quarter of 2002, despite higher occupancy-related costs, including real estate taxes in New York, extra safety measures and higher insurance premiums.
