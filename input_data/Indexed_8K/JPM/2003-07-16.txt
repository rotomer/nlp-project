Exhibit 99.1
News release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported second quarter 2003 net income of $1.83 billion, or $0.89 per share, 78% higher than reported results for the second quarter of 2002. The return on average common equity for the quarter was 17%. Net income for the second quarter of 2002 was $1.03 billion, or $0.50 per share, and net income for the first quarter of 2003 was $1.40 billion, or $0.69 per share.
New York, July 16, 2003
Last year, reported results were lower than results stated on an operating basis, which excluded merger and restructuring costs. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was 55% higher than 2002 second quarter operating earnings. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2002 were $1.18 billion, or $0.58 per share, with a return on common equity of 11%.
For the first six months of 2003, reported net income was $3.23 billion, or $1.57 per share, 61% higher than the prior year's reported results and 39% higher than the prior year's operating results. Reported net income for the first six months of 2002 was $2.01 billion, or $0.99 per share. Operating results for the first six months of 2002 were $2.33 billion, or $1.15 per share. Return on common equity was 15% for the first half of 2003, compared with 11% on an operating basis for the first half of 2002.
"I am pleased with our second quarter results, as we are beginning to realize the earnings potential of the firm. Our investment banking business maintained key leadership positions, benefitted from continued improvement in commercial credit costs and produced strong trading results. Chase Financial Services produced record earnings, with Chase Home Finance capitalizing on the mortgage refinancing boom," said William B. Harrison, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Highlights for the second quarter of 2003:
The results for this quarter include an $100 million addition to the previously established litigation reserve. JPMorgan Chase is in advanced stages of discussion with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York County District Attorney's Office, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department regarding a resolution of all regulatory matters related to the firm's dealings with Enron. The firm expects these discussions will be resolved within the next ninety days. As a result of these discussions, and to cover the expected cost of the settlements, the previously established litigation reserve has been increased by $100 million.

JPMorgan Chase's private equity business. The fair value of public investments held by JPMP are marked-to-market at the quoted public value.

Private investments are initially valued based on cost. The carrying values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with third-party capital providers. In addition, these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by JPMP's senior investment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including, but not limited to, operating performance and future expectations, comparable industry valuations of public companies, changes in market outlook and changes in the third-party financing environment.
