The line of business operating results set forth above for the quarter and for prior periods reflect the revised internal management reporting policies previously disclosed in the firm's
Form 8-K
dated July 11, 2003. The line of business results set forth above are presented on an operating or managed basis, which enables management to assess each business and measure overall firm results against targeted goals. The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and then excludes the impact of merger and restructuring costs, credit card securitizations and special items (which management defined as significant nonrecurring gains or losses of $75 million or more during 2002). Both restructuring charges and special items are viewed by management as transactions that are not part of the firm's normal daily business operations or are unusual in nature and therefore are not indicative of trends.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $793 billion and operations in more than 50 countries.

FIN 46:
JPMorgan Chase's private equity business. The fair value of public investments held by JPMP are marked-to-market at the quoted public value. To determine the carrying values of these investments, JPMP incorporates the use of liquidity discounts to take into account the fact that it cannot immediately realize or hedge the quoted public values as a result of regulatory, corporate and/or contractual sales restrictions imposed on these holdings. Private investments are initially valued based on cost. The carrying values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with third-party capital providers. In addition, these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by JPMP's senior investment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including, but not limited to, operating performance and future expectations, comparable industry valuations of public companies, changes in market outlook and changes in the third-party financing environment.
