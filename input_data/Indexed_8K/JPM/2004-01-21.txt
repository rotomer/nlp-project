JPMorgan Chase's private equity business. The fair value of public investments held by JPMP are marked-to-market at the quoted public value. To determine the carrying values of these investments, JPMP incorporates the use of liquidity discounts to take into account the fact that it cannot immediately realize or hedge the quoted public values as a result of regulatory, corporate and/or contractual sales restrictions imposed on these holdings. Private investments are initially valued based on cost. The carrying values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with third-party capital providers. In addition, these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by JPMP's senior investment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including, but not limited to, operating performance and future expectations, comparable industry valuations of public companies, changes in market outlook and changes in the third-party financing environment.
