Item 5. Other Events
     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., a Delaware corporation ("J.P. Morgan Chase") and Bank One Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Bank One"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 14, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Merger Agreement set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Exhibit. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Bank One with and into J.P. Morgan Chase (the "Merger"). The Merger will be treated as a purchase by J.P. Morgan Chase under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and is intended to constitute a "reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
     If the Merger is completed, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bank One ("Bank One Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into 1.32 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of J.P. Morgan Chase ("J.P. Morgan Chase Common Stock"). In addition, all rights with respect to Bank One Common Stock pursuant to stock options or other stock-based awards outstanding at such effective time, whether or not then exercisable, will be converted into and will become rights with respect to J.P. Morgan Chase Common Stock on otherwise substantially similar terms, adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Merger Agreement also provides, among other things, that the merged company will be headed by William B. Harrison (currently chairman and chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase) as the chairman and chief executive officer and James Dimon (currently chairman and chief executive officer of Bank One) as president and chief operating officer of the merged company, with Mr. Dimon to succeed Mr. Harrison as chief executive officer on the second anniversary of the closing and Mr. Harrison continuing to serve as chairman. In addition, the board of directors of the merged company will have sixteen members, consisting of seven independent directors from J.P. Morgan Chase, seven independent directors from Bank One, plus Messrs. Harrison and Dimon.
     Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the stockholders of both companies, receipt of requisite regulatory approvals from U.S. federal and state and foreign regulatory authorities, and certain other customary conditions.
     In connection with the Merger Agreement, each party has granted to the other an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase, under certain circumstances, up to 19.9% of its outstanding common shares at a price, subject to certain adjustments, of $44.61 per share (in the case of the Option granted by Bank One) and $38.90 per share (in the case of the Option granted by J.P. Morgan Chase) (the "Stock Option Agreements"), copies of which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Stock Option Agreements set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Exhibits. Under certain circumstances, the granting party may be required to repurchase the Option and the shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option.
     A copy of the joint press release of January 14, 2003, regarding the Merger is attached as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

     2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Bank One Common Stock:
          (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and JPMorgan Chase-Owned Stock, etc. All shares of Bank One Common Stock that are owned by Bank One as treasury stock and all shares of Bank One Common Stock that are owned by Bank One or JPMorgan Chase (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, trading account shares, trust shares and DPC shares, as each such term is defined in Section 3.1(b)) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of JPMorgan Chase or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock") that are owned by Bank One shall become treasury stock, except as otherwise provided in JPMorgan Chase's Certificate of Incorporation.
          (b) Conversion of Bank One Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of Bank One Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) shall be converted into 1.32 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. All such shares of Bank One Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock into which such Bank One Common Stock has been converted. Certificates previously representing shares of Bank One Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.
          (c) JPMorgan Chase Capital Stock. Each share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and each share of JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.
          (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of 6.63% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H, and Fixed/Adjustable Noncumulative Preferred Stock of JPMorgan Chase that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have properly perfected their right of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not remain outstanding, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, each share of such JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock held by such stockholder shall remain outstanding in accordance with Section 2.1(c).

     2.2. Exchange of Certificates.
          (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by JPMorgan Chase and reasonably acceptable to Bank One (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Bank One Common Stock (collectively, the "Bank One Certificates"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at JPMorgan Chase's option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively "certificates") representing the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for such shares of Bank One Common Stock. Such certificates for shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund".
          (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of shares of Bank One Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares were converted into shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Bank One Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Bank One Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as JPMorgan Chase and Bank One may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Bank One Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Bank One Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Bank One Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Bank One Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all shares of Bank One Common Stock then held by such holder), and the Bank One Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Bank One Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Bank One, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Bank One Certificate representing such Bank One Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Bank One Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock into which the shares of Bank One Common Stock represented by such Bank One Certificate have been converted as provided in this Article II and the right to receive upon such surrender cash in lieu of any fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.2.
          (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to JPMorgan Chase Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Bank One Certificate with respect to the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock represented thereby,
 
 5
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until the holder of such Bank One Certificate shall surrender such Bank One Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following the surrender of any such Bank One Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock, and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock.
          (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Bank One Common Stock. All shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Bank One Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Bank One Common Stock; , to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Bank One on such shares of Bank One Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Bank One Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Bank One Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
subject, however
          (e) No Fractional Shares(i) . No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Bank One Certificates evidencing Bank One Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Bank One Certificates, JPMorgan Chase shall pay each holder of Bank One Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Bank One Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on the Consolidated Tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.
          (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Bank One for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any stockholders of Bank One who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for JPMorgan Chase Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to JPMorgan Chase Common Stock.
 
 6
          (g) No Liability. None of JPMorgan Chase, Bank One or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Bank One Common Stock for shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
          (h) Withholding. JPMorgan Chase shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Bank One Common Stock or Dissenting Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by JPMorgan Chase, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Bank One Common Stock or Dissenting Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by JPMorgan Chase.
     3.1. Representations and Warranties of Bank One. Except (x) with respect to any subsection of this Section 3.1, as set forth in the correspondingly identified subsection of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(iii)) or (y) as disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Bank One represents and warrants to JPMorgan Chase as follows:

The financial statements of Bank One included in the Bank One SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and fairly
 
 11
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Bank One and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown.
          (ii) Other than the Bank One SEC Documents, which are addressed in clause (i) above, Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31, 2000 with any Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One.
          (iii) Except for (A) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of Bank One included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003, as filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) liabilities incurred since September 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (C) liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One, Bank One and its Subsidiaries do not have, and since September 30, 2003 Bank One and its Subsidiaries have not incurred (except as permitted by Section 4.1), any liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be reflected in Bank One's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).
          (e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Bank One for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by Bank One with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by JPMorgan Chase for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
          (f) Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements. (i) Bank One and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are material to the operation of the businesses of Bank One and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Bank One Permits"), and Bank One and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Bank One Permits and all applicable laws and regulations, except where the failure so to hold or comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One. Except as
 
 12
disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, the businesses of Bank One and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity (including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001), except for possible violations which, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Bank One. To the knowledge of Bank One, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One.
          (ii) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Bank One, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Bank One or of any Bank One Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.
     (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Bank One and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Bank One or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to the extent described in the Bank One SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Bank One and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Bank One (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Bank One, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Bank One by others within those entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Bank One's auditors and the audit committee of Bank One's Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect Bank One's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Bank One's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Bank One's internal controls. Bank One has made available to JPMorgan Chase a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Bank One's auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.
 
 13
          (g) Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of Bank One, threatened, against or affecting Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One as to which there is a significant possibility of an adverse outcome which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Bank One, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One having or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One or on the Surviving Corporation.
          (h) Taxes. Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any of them and have paid (or Bank One has paid on their behalf), or have set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the Bank One SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Bank One and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "tax" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall mean (i) all Federal, state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales, employment, use, property, withholding, excise, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts, (ii) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) as a result of being or having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (iii) liability for the payment of any amounts as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) or (ii). Neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
          (i) Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement and the Option Agreements, neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $10 million or more per annum, (ii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) which limits the ability of Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any person, or which requires referrals of business or requires Bank One or any of its affiliates to make available investment opportunities to any person on a priority, equal or exclusive basis, and in each case which limitation or requirement would reasonably be expected to be material to Bank One and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement), (v) in the case of a Bank One Benefit Plan, any of the benefits of which
 
 14
will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or (vi) which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements. Bank One has previously made available to JPMorgan Chase complete and accurate copies of each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.1(i) (collectively referred to herein as the "Bank One Contracts"). All of the Bank One Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One. Neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the best knowledge of Bank One, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any Bank One Contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Bank One.
          (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each employee benefit plan (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) and all stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and other material employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal, oral or written, legally binding or not (all the foregoing being herein called "Benefit Plans"), under which any employee or former employee of Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits, maintained or contributed to by Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries or under which Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (the "Bank One Benefit Plans"), Bank One has made available, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will make available, to JPMorgan Chase a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (B) such Bank One Benefit Plan, (C) each trust agreement relating to such Bank One Benefit Plan, (D) the most recent summary plan description for each Bank One Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Bank One Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to any Bank One Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
          (i) With respect to the Bank One Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Bank One, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.
          (ii) True and complete copies of the Bank One Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof have been, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will be, provided or made available to JPMorgan Chase.
 
15
          (iv) Except as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, no Bank One Benefit Plan or Bank One Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or former employee of Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G.
          (k) Subsidiaries. Exhibit 21 to Bank One's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement includes all the Subsidiaries of Bank One which are Significant Subsidiaries.

Section 55, nonassessable and are owned by Bank One or a Subsidiary of Bank One free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance.
          (l) Agreements with Regulators. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, neither Bank One nor any Subsidiary of Bank One is a party to any written agreement, consent decree or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies or its management, nor has Bank One been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such agreement, decree, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, order, directive or similar submission, or any such policy, procedure or board resolutions.
          (m) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

          (n) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Bank One, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly called and held (the "Bank One Board Approval"), has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Bank One and its stockholders and declared the Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Bank One adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by Bank One stockholders at the Bank One

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bank One Common Stock to adopt this Agreement (the "Required Bank One Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Bank One capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

Neither Bank One nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and to Bank One's knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts with, the rights of others with respect to the use of any Bank One Intellectual Property that

22
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown.
          (ii) Other than the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents, which are addressed in clause (i) above, JPMorgan Chase and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31, 2000 with any Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase.
          (iii) Except for (A) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of JPMorgan Chase included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003, as filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) liabilities incurred since September 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (C) liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries do not have, and since September 30, 2003 JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries have not incurred (except as permitted by Section 4.2), any liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be reflected in JPMorgan Chase's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).
          (e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by JPMorgan Chase for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

23
          (f) Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements. (i) JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are material to the operation of the businesses of JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "JPMorgan Chase Permits"), and JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the JPMorgan Chase Permits and all applicable laws and regulations, except where the failure so to hold or comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase. Except as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, the businesses of JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity (including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001), except for possible violations which, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase. To the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase.
          (ii) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of JPMorgan Chase, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of JPMorgan Chase or of any JPMorgan Chase Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.
          (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of JPMorgan Chase or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to the extent described in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. JPMorgan Chase (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to JPMorgan Chase, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of JPMorgan Chase by others
 
24
within those entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to JPMorgan Chase's auditors and the audit committee of JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect JPMorgan Chase's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for JPMorgan Chase's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in JPMorgan Chase's internal controls. JPMorgan Chase has made available to Bank One a summary of any such disclosure made by management to JPMorgan Chase's auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.
          (g) Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, threatened, against or affecting JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase as to which there is a significant possibility of an adverse outcome which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase or on the Surviving Corporation.
          (h) Taxes. JPMorgan Chase and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any of them and have paid (or JPMorgan Chase has paid on their behalf), or have set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for. Neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement or plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
          (i) Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement and the Option Agreements, neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $10 million or more per annum, (ii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) which limits the ability of JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any person, or which requires referrals of business or requires JPMorgan Chase or any of its affiliates to make available investment opportunities to any person on a priority, equal or exclusive basis, and in each case which limitation or requirement would reasonably be
 
25
expected to be material to JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement), (v) in the case of a JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or (vi) which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements. JPMorgan Chase has previously made available to Bank One complete and accurate copies of each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.2(i) (collectively referred to herein as "JPMorgan Chase Contracts"). All of the JPMorgan Chase Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase. Neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the best knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any JPMorgan Chase Contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase.
          (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries or under which JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries have any present or future liability (the "JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans"), JPMorgan Chase has made available, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will make available, to Bank One a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (B) such JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, (C) each trust agreement relating to such JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, (D) the most recent summary plan description for each JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to any JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
          (ii) With respect to the JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.
          (iii) True and complete copies of the JPMorgan Chase Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof have been, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will be, provided or made available to Bank One.
          (iv) Except as set forth in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, no JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan or JPMorgan Chase Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or former employee of JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan
 
26
Chase of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G.
          (k) Subsidiaries.

Section 55, nonassessable and are owned by JPMorgan Chase or a Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance.
          (l) Agreements with Regulators. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(l) of the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, neither JPMorgan Chase nor any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase is a party to any written agreement, consent decree or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies or its management, nor has JPMorgan Chase been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such agreement, decree, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, order, directive or similar submission, or any such policy, procedure or board resolutions.
          (m) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

The JPMorgan Chase Board Approval constitutes approval of this Agreement, the JPMorgan Chase Stock Option Agreement and the Merger for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL. To
 
27
the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, except for Section 203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to this Agreement, the Option Agreements, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
          (o) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock to adopt this Agreement (the "Required JPMorgan Chase Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of JPMorgan Chase capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

Except as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, JPMorgan Chase or one of its Subsidiaries (i) has good and marketable title to all the properties and assets reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in such JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents as being owned by JPMorgan Chase or one of its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof which are material to JPMorgan Chase's business on a consolidated basis (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, except (A) statutory liens securing payments not yet due, (B) liens on assets of Subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase which are banks incurred in the ordinary course of their banking business and (C) such imperfections or irregularities of title, claims, liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances as do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties, and (ii) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements included in such JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents or acquired after the date thereof which are material to its business on a consolidated basis (except for leases that have expired by their terms since the date thereof) and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to JPMorgan Chase's knowledge, the lessor, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase.
          (q) Intellectual Property. JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries own or have a valid license to use all trademarks, service marks and trade names (including any registrations or applications for registration of any of the foregoing) (collectively, the "JPMorgan Chase Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on their business substantially as currently conducted, except where such failures to own or validly license such JPMorgan Chase Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase. Neither JPMorgan Chase nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and to JPMorgan Chase's knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts with, the rights of others with respect to the use of any JPMorgan Chase Intellectual Property that individually or in the aggregate, in either such case, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase.

Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to either of the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase.
          (b) Bank One shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "Bank One Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Bank One Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Bank One shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Bank One stockholders the Required Bank One Vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Bank One of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the adoption thereof.
          (c) JPMorgan Chase shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "JPMorgan Chase Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required JPMorgan Chase Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the JPMorgan Chase stockholders the Required JPMorgan Chase Vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve JPMorgan Chase of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the adoption thereof.
 
39
          (d) Bank One and JPMorgan Chase shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Bank One Stockholders Meeting and the JPMorgan Chase Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same date.
     5.2. Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice, Bank One and JPMorgan Chase shall each (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, each of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, Federal or state banking laws or the rules and regulations of self regulatory organizations (other than reports or documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
          (a) The parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter dated December 23, 2003, between Bank One and JPMorgan Chase (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
          (b) No such investigation by either JPMorgan Chase or Bank One shall affect the representations and warranties of the other.
     5.3. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Each of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and/or any other public or private third party which is required to be obtained or made by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; that a party shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or such compliance or the obtaining of such consent, authorization, order, approval or exemption will result in a condition or restriction on such party or on the Surviving Corporation having an effect of the type referred to in Section 6.1(f). Each of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to the other in connection with any such efforts by, or requirement imposed upon, any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing.
provided, however,
 
40
          (a) JPMorgan Chase agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, supplemental indentures and other instruments required for the due assumption of Bank One's outstanding debt, guarantees and other securities to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees and securities and the instruments and agreements relating thereto.
          (b) Each of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Option Agreements or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger, the Option Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
     5.4. Acquisition Proposals. (a) Each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than any such transaction permitted by Section 4.1(e) or (f) in the case of Bank One, and Section 4.2(e) or (f) in the case of JPMorgan Chase) or any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including, without limitation, stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other party to this Agreement or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
     (b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of each party shall be permitted, prior to its respective meeting of stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 5.1, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.4 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable to such party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any
 
41
person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person first made after the date of this Agreement which such party's Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of such party reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
     (ii) Each party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs such party or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Each party shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other party, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with this Section 5.4(b) and keep the other party informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.
     (iii) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit either party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 7.1(d) or (e), as applicable.
provided, however
          (c) Each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One agrees that (i) it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4.
          (d) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall (x) permit either party to terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under this Agreement. Neither party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.
          (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase or Bank One, as
 
42
the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of JPMorgan Chase or Bank One, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "20% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase or Bank One, as the case may be.
provided
          (f) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(iii) shall be deemed to be a Change in Bank One Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.1(d)) or Change in JPMorgan Chase Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.1(e)), as the case may be, unless the Board of Directors of the party making such disclosure expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement.
     5.5. Affiliates. Bank One shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) to deliver to JPMorgan Chase, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the Bank One Stockholders Meeting, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.5.
     5.6. Stock Exchange Listing. JPMorgan Chase shall use all reasonable efforts to cause (i) the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii) the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of Bank One Stock Options (as defined below), to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.
     5.7. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) JPMorgan Chase and Bank One agree that, except as otherwise provided herein (including as set forth in Section 5.7(a) of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule or Section 5.7(a) of the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, as applicable) and unless otherwise mutually determined, the JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans and Bank One Benefit Plans in effect at the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective Time with respect to employees covered by such plans at the Effective Time, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to formulate Benefit Plans for the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with respect both to employees who were covered by the JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans and Bank One Benefit Plans at the Effective Time and employees who were not covered by such plans at the Effective Time, that provide benefits for services on a basis that does not discriminate between employees who were covered by the JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans and employees who were covered by the Bank One Benefit Plans.
 
43
          (b) With respect to Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to outside the United States for the benefit of non-United States citizens or residents, the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph of this Section 5.7 shall apply to the extent the application of such principles does not violate applicable foreign law.
     5.8. Bank One Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Bank One Common Stock (a "Bank One Stock Option") and each outstanding stock appreciation right (a "Bank One SAR") or restricted stock unit (a "Bank One Unit") or other equity-based award or right in respect of or based on the value of Bank One Common Stock (an "Other Bank One Equity Right") issued pursuant to any Bank One Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by JPMorgan Chase, and each share of Bank One Common Stock subject to restrictions that do not lapse upon the Effective Time (a "Bank One Restricted Share") shall be honored by JPMorgan Chase in accordance with their terms following their conversion in the Merger into restricted shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Each Bank One Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Bank One Stock Option, the same number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock as the holder of such Bank One Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share, at a price per share equal to (y) the exercise price per share of the shares of Bank One Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Bank One Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest cent; that in the case of any option to which section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth above unless use of such method will not preserve the status of such options as incentive stock options, in which case the manner of determination shall be adjusted in a manner that both complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and results in the smallest modification in the economic values that otherwise would be achieved by the holder pursuant to the method set forth above.
provided, however,
          (b) Each holder of a Bank One SAR shall be entitled to that number of stock appreciation rights of JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan Chase SARs"), determined in the same manner as set forth above with respect to Bank One Stock Options assumed by JPMorgan Chase. Each holder of a Bank One Unit shall be entitled to that number of restricted stock units of JPMorgan Chase determined by multiplying the number of Bank One Units held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. Each Other Bank One Equity Right shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Bank One Common Stock and shall be converted into a right or award with respect to shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock determined in the same manner as set forth above with respect to Bank One Stock Options.
          (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall deliver to the holders of Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Bank One Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares
 
44
or Other Bank One Equity Rights, as the case may be, shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.8 after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by JPMorgan Chase as set forth above). If necessary, JPMorgan Chase shall comply with the terms of the applicable Bank One Stock Plan and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, Section 5.8(a) and such Plan, that Bank One Stock Options which qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options of JPMorgan Chase after the Effective Time.
          (d) JPMorgan Chase shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights assumed by it in accordance with this Section 5.8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock subject to such Bank One equity awards and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Bank One equity awards remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, JPMorgan Chase shall administer the Bank One Stock Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 5.8 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the applicable Bank One Stock Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.
          (e) Assuming that Bank One delivers to JPMorgan Chase the Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Bank One Insiders (as defined below) of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock in exchange for shares of Bank One Common Stock (including Bank One Restricted Shares), and of options or stock appreciation rights to purchase JPMorgan Chase Common Stock upon conversion of Bank One Stock Options and Bank One SARS or to receive shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock upon conversion of Bank One Units and Other Bank One Equity Rights, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by Bank One to JPMorgan Chase prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Bank One Insiders, the number of shares of Bank One Common Stock held by each such Bank One Insider and the number and description of the Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights held by each such Bank One Insider. "Bank One Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Bank One who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.
 
45
     5.9. Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except as otherwise provided in the Option Agreements or in Section 7.2 hereof and except that (a) if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on either party in connection with the Merger, and (b) expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by JPMorgan Chase and Bank One.
     5.10. Governance. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall take all actions necessary to adopt the amendment to the By-laws of JPMorgan Chase provided for in Exhibit 1.4(b) hereof and to effect the requirements and adopt the resolutions referenced therein. On or prior to the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be 16. Of the members of the initial Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, seven shall be current independent JPMorgan Chase directors designated by JPMorgan Chase plus the current Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase, and seven shall be current independent Bank One directors designated by Bank One plus the current Chief Executive Officer of Bank One. No other directors or employees of JPMorgan Chase or Bank One shall be designated to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time.
          (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the persons indicated in Exhibit 5.10(b) to be elected or appointed to the offices of the Surviving Corporation specified in such Exhibit as of the Effective Time.
          (c) In accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation (as amended as provided in Exhibit 1.4(b)), (i) effective as of the Effective Time, Mr. William Harrison shall continue to serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation and Mr. James Dimon shall become President and Chief Operating Officer of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) Mr. Dimon shall be the successor to Mr. Harrison as Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, with such succession to become effective on the second anniversary of the Closing Date or any such earlier date as of which Mr. Harrison ceases for any reason to serve in the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, and (iii) Mr. Harrison shall continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of the Surviving Corporation following the date of such succession.
          (d) The headquarters of the Surviving Corporation will be located in New York, New York.
     5.11. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
 
46
Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) ("Indemnified Liabilities") to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Bank One pursuant to Bank One's Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of Bank One and its Subsidiaries.
          (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Bank One ( that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by Bank One for such insurance ("Bank One's Current Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of Bank One's Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of Bank One's Current Premium. In the event that JPMorgan Chase acts as its own insurer for its directors and officers generally with respect to matters typically covered by a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, JPMorgan Chase's obligations under this Section 5.11(b) may be satisfied by such self-insurance, so long as JPMorgan Chase's senior debt ratings by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. are no lower than such ratings as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
provided
provided, however,
          (c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.11.
          (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.
          (e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and (ii)
 
47
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.
     5.12. Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One shall coordinate with the other the payment of dividends with respect to the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Bank One Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Bank One Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and/or Bank One Common Stock or any shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock that any such holder receives in exchange for such shares of Bank One Common Stock in the Merger.
     5.13. Public Announcements. JPMorgan Chase and Bank One shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to develop a joint communications plan, (ii) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1 or as otherwise permitted under Section 4.4, no party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall provide the other party with its stockholder lists and allow and facilitate the other party's contact with its stockholders and prospective investors and following a Change in Bank One Recommendation or Change in JPMorgan Chase Recommendation, as the case may be, such contacts may be made without regard to the above limitations of this Section 5.13.
     5.14. Commitments to the Community. (a) Following the Effective Time, the retail financial services business, which includes consumer banking, small businesses, middle market and consumer lending, will maintain a significant presence in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. The combined business will continue to use both the Bank One brand and the JPMorgan Chase brand while research is conducted to determine the best long-term branding strategy. Chicago will serve as the headquarters for the retail financial services business following the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the credit card business of the Surviving Corporation will be based in Wilmington, Delaware and will continue to use both the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase brands.
          (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain its strong commitment to charitable giving in the greater Chicago metropolitan area and to increasing the annual level of charitable giving beyond the current levels of Bank One in that area.
          (c) The commitments set forth in this Section 5.14 will be reflected in the minutes of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date.
 
48
     5.15. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

WHEREAS
          , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Issuer and Grantee agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1.

 2
          3. .
Exercise of Option
               (a) Grantee may exercise the Option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time following the occurrence of a Purchase Event (as defined in Section 3(b)) on or after the date hereof; provided that the Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of (A) the Effective Time, (B) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof so long as, in the case of this clause (B), a Purchase Event has not occurred and could not occur in the future, (C) the date that Grantee's Total Profit equals $2.87 billion (the "Maximum Profit"), and (D) the date which is six months after the occurrence of a Purchase Event; and provided, further, that any purchase of shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with applicable law; and provided, further, that Grantee shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in Section 3(d)) within six months following such Purchase Event. Notwithstanding the termination of the Option, Grantee shall be entitled to purchase those Option Shares with respect to which it has exercised the Option in accordance herewith prior to the termination of the Option. The termination of the Option shall not affect any rights hereunder which by their terms extend beyond the date of such termination.
               (b) As used herein, a "Purchase Event" means any of the following events:
                    (i) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, without Grantee's prior written consent, Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into one or more agreements with any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) to effect, or shall have effected, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, any Acquisition Proposal;
                    (ii) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than a group of which Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee is a member, shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, shares of Issuer Common Stock or other voting securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC); or
                    (iii) the occurrence of an event the result of which is that the fee required to be paid by Issuer pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i) or 7.2(c)(ii)(C) or 7.2(c)(iii)(D) of the Merger Agreement becomes payable.
               (c) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Purchase Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of Grantee to exercise the Option.
               (d) In the event Grantee wishes to exercise the Option, Grantee shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which is herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of Option Shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a
 
 3
place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing (the "Closing") of such purchase (the date of such Closing, the "Closing Date"); provided that if the Closing cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the need to obtain any necessary approvals or consents of applicable Governmental Entities, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, that if prior notification or application to, approval of or authorization by any Governmental Entity is required in connection with such purchase, Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Grantee in the prompt filing of the required notice or application for approval or authorization, and the Closing shall occur immediately following the date on which such approvals have been obtained and any required notification or waiting periods have expired.
               (e) In the event Grantee receives official notice that an approval or consent of any Governmental Entity required for the purchase of Option Shares will not be issued or granted, Grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option in connection with the resale of Issuer Common Stock or other securities pursuant to a registration statement as provided in Section 10. The provisions of this Section 3 and Section 4 shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any such exercise.
          4.
Payment and Delivery of Certificates.
               (a) On each Closing Date, Grantee shall (i) pay to Issuer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer (provided that the failure or refusal of Issuer to designate a bank account shall not preclude Grantee from exercising the Option), an amount equal to the Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date, and (ii) present and surrender this Agreement to Issuer at the address of Issuer specified in Section 14(f).
               (b) At each Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds and surrender of this Agreement as provided in Section 4(a), (i) Issuer shall deliver to Grantee (A) a certificate or certificates representing the Option Shares to be purchased at such Closing, which Option Shares shall be fully paid, validly issued and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances ("Liens") other than those created by the express terms of this Agreement, and subject to no preemptive or other similar rights, and (B) if the Option is exercised in part only, an executed new agreement with the same terms as this Agreement evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder, and (ii) Grantee shall deliver to Issuer a letter agreeing that Grantee shall not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such Option Shares in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws or of the provisions of this Agreement.
               (c) In addition to any other legend that is required by applicable law, certificates for the Option Shares delivered at each Closing shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows:

THE TRANSFER OF THE STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.
It is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if such Option Shares have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act, such Option Shares have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or Grantee shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.
               (d) Upon the giving by Grantee to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under Section 3(d), the tender of the applicable Purchase Price in immediately available funds and the tender of this Agreement to Issuer, Grantee shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Issuer Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, regardless of whether the stock transfer books of Issuer are then closed or certificates representing such shares of Issuer Common Stock are then actually delivered to Grantee. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, foreign, state, and local taxes and other charges, that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 4(d) in the name of Grantee or its assignee, transferee, or designee.
               (e) Issuer agrees (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from Liens and preemptive or similar rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Issuer Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Issuer Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Issuer Common Stock then outstanding, (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, sale of assets or similar transaction, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, agreements, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer, and (iii) that it will promptly take all action as may from time to time be required (including (A) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements and (B) in the event prior approval or authorization of or notice or application to any Governmental Entity is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with Grantee in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to such Governmental Entities as may be required) in order to permit Grantee to exercise the Option and Issuer to duly and effectively issue shares of Issuer Common Stock pursuant hereto on a timely basis.

Purchase Not for Distribution
          7.
Adjustment upon Changes in Issuer Capitalization, Etc.
               (a) In the event of any change from time to time in Issuer Common Stock or any other shares or securities subject to the Option by reason of a stock dividend, subdivision, spinoff, stock split, split-up, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, or dividend or distribution, other than regular cash dividends, on or in respect of the Issuer Common Stock, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the Option, and the Purchase Price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that Grantee shall receive, upon exercise of the Option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that Grantee would have received in respect of Issuer Common Stock if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. If any additional shares of Issuer Common Stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in the first sentence of this Section 7(a) or upon exercise of the Option), the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, it, together with any shares of Issuer Common Stock previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. No provision of this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect or change, or constitute authorization for any violation of, any of the covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in the Merger Agreement.
 
 7
               (b) Without limiting the parties' relative rights, remedies, liabilities and obligations under the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, in the event that, prior to the termination of the Option, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (other than the Merger Agreement) (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for another class or series of stock or other securities of Issuer or any other person or cash or any other property, or the outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock immediately prior to such merger shall, after such merger, represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents having general voting power of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets (or those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of Grantee, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined), (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation, or (z) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), Issuer (such person being referred to as the "Substitute Option Issuer").
               (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option; provided that the exercise price therefor and number of shares subject thereto shall be as set forth in this Section 7 and the repurchase rights relating thereto shall be as set forth in Section 9; providedfurther, that if a Purchase Event shall have occurred prior to or in connection with the issuance of such Substitute Option, the Substitute Option shall be exercisable immediately upon issuance without the occurrence of a further Purchase Event; and provided, further, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to Grantee. Substitute Option Issuer shall also enter into an agreement with Grantee in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
,
               (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the Market/Offer Price (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore exercisable, divided by the Average Price (as hereinafter defined). The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Option Price") shall then be equal to the Purchase Price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
               (e) The following terms have the meanings indicated:
                    (i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (x) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), or at
 
 8
Grantee's election, any person that controls such surviving corporation, (y) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, or (z) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets (or of the assets of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole).
                    (ii) "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (v) the highest price per share of Issuer Common Stock at which a tender offer or an exchange offer therefor has been made, (w) the highest price per share of Issuer Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (x) the price per share of Issuer Common Stock received by holders of Issuer Common Stock in connection with any merger or other business combination transaction described in Section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii), (y) the highest closing price for shares of Issuer Common Stock within the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the merger, consolidation, asset sale or other transaction in question is consummated, and (z) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets (or those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) an amount equal to (I) the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer, as determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee, divided by (II) the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock outstanding at such time. In calculating the Market/Offer Price, in the event that a tender offer or an exchange offer is made for Issuer Common Stock or an agreement is entered into involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities or other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for Issuer Common Stock shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee.
                    (iii) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing sales price per share of a share of Substitute Common Stock quoted on the NYSE (or if Substitute Common Stock is not quoted on the NYSE, the average closing sales price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System or, if the shares of Substitute Common Stock are not quoted thereon, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source) for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of consummation of the consolidation, merger or sale in question; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by Issuer, by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls such person, as Grantee may elect.
                    (iv) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the shares of capital stock (or similar equity interest) with the greatest voting power in respect of the election of directors (or persons similarly responsible for the direction of the business and affairs) of the Substitute Option Issuer.
               (f) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock but for the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f), Substitute Option Issuer shall make a cash payment to Grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f). This
 
 9
difference in value shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee.
               (g) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in Section 7(b) unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder and take all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this Section 7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action that may be necessary so that the holders of the other shares of common stock issued by Substitute Option Issuer are not entitled to exercise any rights by reason of the issuance or exercise of the Substitute Option and the shares of Substitute Common Stock are otherwise in no way distinguishable from or have lesser economic value (other than any diminution in value resulting from the fact that the shares of Substitute Common Stock are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor provision) than other shares of common stock issued by Substitute Option Issuer).
          8.
Repurchase at the Option of Grantee.
               (a) At the request of Grantee at any time commencing upon the first occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined in Section 8(c)) and prior to the termination of the Option pursuant to Section 3(a), Issuer (or any successor) shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Option and (y) all shares of Issuer Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on which Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 8 is referred to as the "Request Date". Such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Section 8 Repurchase Consideration") equal to the sum of:
                    (i) the aggregate Purchase Price paid by Grantee for any shares of Issuer Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Option with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership;
                    (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Market/Offer Price for each share of Issuer Common Stock over (y) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7), multiplied by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which the Option has not been exercised; and
                    (iii) the excess, if any, of the Market/Offer Price over the Purchase Price paid (or, in the case of Option Shares with respect to which the Option has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred, payable, as adjusted pursuant to Section 7) by Grantee for each share of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which the Option has been exercised and with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares.
               (b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 8, Issuer shall, within 5 business days after the Request Date, pay the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Issuer the Option and the certificates evidencing the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchased thereunder with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, and Grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are
 
10
then free and clear of all Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, Grantee shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to Section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that Issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of the portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any Governmental Entity disapproves of any part of Issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this Section 8, Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such repurchase) in part but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the Option and/or Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee shall thereupon have the right to exercise the Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the Option was exercisable at the Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case of clause (ii), Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to Grantee that portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering and (y) deliver to Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Issuer Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, or (B) a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the Option shall have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be scheduled to terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the thirtieth business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have the right so to exercise the Option or exercise its rights under this Section 8 until the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall notify Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within 10 business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.
               (c) As used herein, a "Repurchase Event" shall occur if (A) (i) any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any group shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock or (ii) any of the transactions described in Section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) has been consummated and (B) a Purchase Event shall have occurred prior to the termination of the Option.
 
11
          9.
Repurchase of Substitute Option.
               (a) At the request of Grantee at any time prior to the termination of the Substitute Option as set forth in Section 3(a), Substitute Option Issuer (or any successor) shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Substitute Option and (y) all shares of Substitute Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on which Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9 is referred to as the "Section 9 Request Date". Such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Section 9 Repurchase Consideration") equal to the sum of:
                    (i) the aggregate purchase price paid by Grantee for any shares of Substitute Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Option or Substitute Option with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership;
                    (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Substitute Applicable Price (as hereinafter defined) for each share of Substitute Common Stock over (y) the Substitute Option Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7) multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock with respect to which the Substitute Option has not been exercised; and
                    (iii) the excess, if any, of the Substitute Applicable Price over the purchase price paid (or in the case of shares with respect to which the Option or Substitute Option has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred, payable) by Grantee for each share of Substitute Common Stock with respect to which the Option or Substitute Option has been exercised and with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares.
               (b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9, Substitute Option Issuer shall, within 5 business days after the Section 9 Request Date, pay the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Substitute Option Issuer the Substitute Option and the certificates evidencing the shares of Substitute Common Stock purchased thereunder with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, and Grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration, Grantee shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to Section 9, in whole or in part, or to require that Substitute Option Issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of the portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any Governmental Entity disapproves of any part of Substitute Option Issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this Section 9, Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to
 
12
Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Substitute Option Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such repurchase) in part but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the Substitute Option and/or Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee shall thereupon have the right to exercise the Substitute Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the Substitute Option was exercisable at the Section 9 Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the Substitute Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the Substitute Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case of clause (ii), Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to Grantee that portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration that Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering and (y) deliver to Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which is the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration or (B) a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the Substitute Option shall have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be scheduled to terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the 30th business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have the right so to exercise the Substitute Option or exercise its rights under Section 9 until the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall notify Substitute Option Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within 10 business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.
               (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Substitute Applicable Price" means the highest closing sales price per share of Substitute Common Stock during the six months preceding the Section 9 Request Date.
               (d) Following the conversion of the Option into a Substitute Option, all references to "Issuer", "Issuer Common Stock" and "Section 8" contained herein shall also be deemed to be references to "Substitute Option Issuer", "Substitute Common Stock" and "Section 9", respectively.
          10.
Registration Rights.
               (a) . Issuer shall, subject to the conditions of Section 10(c) below, if requested by any Grantee following a Purchase Event that occurs prior to the termination of the Option, including Grantee and any permitted transferee ("Selling Stockholder"), as expeditiously as possible prepare, file and keep current a registration statement under the Securities Act if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of Issuer Common Stock or other securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the Selling Stockholder upon exercise of the Option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the Selling Stockholder in such request, including, without limitation, a "shelf" registration statement under Rule 415 under the
Demand Registration Rights
 
13
Securities Act or any successor provision, and Issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares or other securities for sale under any applicable state securities laws.
               (b) . If Issuer at any time after the exercise of the Option proposes to register any shares of Issuer Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with an underwritten public offering of such Issuer Common Stock, Issuer will promptly give written notice to Grantee of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any Selling Stockholder given within 30 days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by the Selling Stockholder), Issuer will cause all such shares for which a Selling Stockholder requests participation in such registration to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that Issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if in the reasonable good faith opinion of the underwriters for such offering, the inclusion of all such shares by the Selling Stockholder would materially interfere with the marketing of such offering (in which case Issuer shall register as many shares as possible without materially interfering with the marketing of the offering), or (ii) in the case of a registration solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on Form S-4 of the Securities Act or any successor Form. If some but not all the shares of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which Issuer shall have received requests for registration pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be excluded from such registration, Issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be registered among the Selling Stockholders desiring to register their shares pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be registered by each such Selling Stockholder bears to the total number of shares requested to be registered by all such Selling Stockholders then desiring to have Issuer Common Stock registered for sale.
Additional Registration Rights
               (c) . Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each registration statement referred to in Section 10(a) above to become effective and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sale or other disposition; provided, however, that Issuer may delay any registration of Option Shares required pursuant to Section 10(a) above for a period not exceeding 90 days provided Issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would adversely affect an offering of other securities by Issuer then in registration, and Issuer shall not be required to register Option Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 10(a) above:

                    (i) prior to the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Article VII thereof and (b) a Purchase Event;
                    (ii) on more than three occasions;
                    (iii) within 90 days after the effective date of a registration referred to in Section 10(b) above pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder or Selling Stockholders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register all such shares under the Securities Act and shares were registered to the extent requested; and
 
14
                    (iv) unless a request therefor is made to register at least 25% or more of the aggregate number of Option Shares (including shares of Issuer Common Stock and other securities issuable upon exercise of the Option) then outstanding.
          In addition to the foregoing, Issuer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement (other than a shelf registration statement referred to in Section 10(a)) after the expiration of three months from the effective date of such registration statement. Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of the Option Shares so registered in accordance with the intended method of distribution for such shares; provided, however, that Issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. If requested by any such Grantee in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements. Upon receiving any request under this Section 10 from any Grantee, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 10, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies.
          Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 10, in lieu of complying with its obligations pursuant to a request made by any Grantee under this Section 10, Issuer may, at its election, repurchase the Option Shares requested to be registered by such Grantee at a purchase price per share equal to the average closing price of such Option Shares during the 10 business days preceding the date on which Issuer gives notice to Grantee of its intention to repurchase such Option Shares (which notice shall be given no later than 15 days after Grantee has given notice to Issuer of its election to exercise its registration rights under Section 10(a) or 10(b)).
               (d) . Except where applicable state law prohibits such payments and except for underwriting discounts or commissions and brokers' fees, Issuer will pay all expenses (including, without limitation, registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel), legal fees and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose Option Shares are being registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions but including liability insurance if Issuer so desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above (including the related offerings and sales by holders of Option Shares) and all other qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above.
Expenses
               (e) . In connection with any registration under Section 10(a) or 10(b) above, Issuer hereby indemnifies the Selling Stockholders, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such Selling Stockholders or underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and including each director, officer, stockholder, partner, member, employee, representative and agent of any thereof, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue,
Indemnification
 
15
statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement that was included by Issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to Issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and Issuer and each person, if any, who controls Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each director, officer, stockholder, partner, member, employee, representative and agent of Issuer shall be indemnified by such Selling Stockholders, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement, that was included by Issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to Issuer by such Selling Stockholders or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use.
          Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 10(e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this Section 10(e), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this Section 10(e) unless the failure so to notify the indemnified party results in substantial prejudice thereto. In case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees and expenses of such counsel. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
          If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10(e) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Issuer, the Selling
 
16
Stockholders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of Issuer, the Selling Stockholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall any Selling Stockholder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its Option Shares included in the offering. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Any obligation by any Selling Stockholder to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other Selling Stockholders.
          In connection with any registration pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above, Issuer and each Selling Stockholder (other than Grantee) shall enter into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of this Section 10(e).
               (f) . Issuer shall comply with all reporting requirements and will do all such other things as may be necessary to permit the expeditious sale at any time of any Option Shares by the Selling Stockholders thereof in accordance with and to the extent permitted by any rule or regulation promulgated by the SEC from time to time, including, without limitation, Rule 144. Issuer shall at its expense provide the Selling Stockholders with any information necessary in connection with the completion and filing of any reports or forms required to be filed by them under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or required pursuant to any state securities laws or the rules of the NASD or any stock exchange.
Miscellaneous Reporting
               (g) . Issuer will pay all stamp taxes in connection with the issuance and the sale of the Option Shares and in connection with the exercise of the Option, and will save the Selling Stockholders harmless, without limitation as to time, against any and all liabilities with respect to all such taxes.
Issue Taxes
          11. If Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be acquired in connection with the exercise of the Option are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the NYSE, the Nasdaq National Market System or any other securities exchange or securities quotation system, Issuer, upon the request of Grantee, will promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation or trading or listing the shares of Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the Option on such securities exchange or securities quotation system and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation or listing as soon as practicable.
Quotation or Listing.
          12. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder, in which event, (i) the "Maximum Profit" in each agreement resulting from such exchange shall be allocated among the
Division of Option.
 
17
several agreements in proportion to the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant thereto so that the sum of the "Maximum Profit" for all such agreements shall total $2.87 billion, (ii) the amount referred to in clause (D) of Section 13(b) of each agreement resulting from such exchange shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to each such agreement and the denominator of which is the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to all such agreements collectively and (iii) such other adjustments, if any, shall be made as are necessary to preserve the overall economic impact and intent of this Agreement (including Section 13 hereof). The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any other Stock Option Agreement and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification to protect Issuer from any loss which it may suffer if this Agreement is replaced, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date.
          13. . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Merger Agreement, in no event shall Grantee's Total Profit (as defined below) exceed the Maximum Profit, and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, Grantee, at its sole discretion, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares subject to the Option (and any Substitute Option), (ii) deliver to Issuer, or the Substitute Issuer, as the case may be, for cancellation shares of Issuer Common Stock or Substitute Common Stock, as the case may be (or other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged), (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or the Substitute Issuer, as the case may be, (iv) reduce the amount of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration or Section 9 Repurchase Consideration or (v) any combination of the foregoing, so that Grantee's actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed the Maximum Profit after taking into account the foregoing actions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than the Maximum Profit and, if exercise of the Option would otherwise result in the Notional Total Profit exceeding such amount, Grantee, in its discretion, may take any of the actions specified in this Section 13(a) so that the Notional Total Profit shall not exceed the Maximum Profit; provided that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any subsequent exercise of the Option which at such time complies with this sentence.
Limitation of Grantee Profit
               (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Total Profit" shall mean: (i) the aggregate amount (before taxes) of (A) the excess of (x) the net cash amounts or fair market value of any property received by Grantee pursuant to a sale of Option Shares (or securities into which such shares are converted or exchanged), other than to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Grantee, or a repurchase of Option Shares by Issuer pursuant to Section 8 hereof, after payment of applicable brokerage or sales commissions and discounts, over (y) Grantee's aggregate purchase price for such Option Shares (or other securities), plus (B) all amounts received by Grantee upon the repurchase of the Option by Issuer pursuant to Section 8 hereof, plus (C) all equivalent net amounts with respect to the Substitute Option and any amounts paid pursuant to Section 7(f) hereof, plus (D) all amounts received by Grantee pursuant to Section 7.2(c) of the Merger Agreement, minus (ii) all amounts of cash previously paid to Issuer pursuant to Section 13(a) plus the value of the Option Shares (or other securities) previously delivered to Issuer for cancellation pursuant to Section 13(a), which value shall be deemed to be the aggregate Purchase
 
18
Price paid for such Option Shares (or other securities). For purposes of this Agreement, "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise the Option shall be the Total Profit, determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that the Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares, and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Issuer Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). For purposes of this Section 13, transactions by a wholly-owned Subsidiary transferee of Grantee in respect of the Option or Option Shares transferred to it shall be treated as if made by Grantee.
               (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the ability of Grantee to receive, nor relieve Issuer's obligation to pay, any payment provided for in Section 7.2(c) of the Merger Agreement; provided that if and to the extent the Total Profit received by Grantee would exceed the Maximum Profit following receipt of such payment, Grantee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of Section 13(a) within 15 days of the date on which Grantee has realized cash and/or property representing Total Profit in excess of Maximum Profit.
          14.
Miscellaneous.
               (a) . Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.
Expenses
               (b) . Any provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such provision. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.
Waiver and Amendment
               (c) . This Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement and the other documents and instruments referred to herein and therein, between Grantee and Issuer constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (or their respective successors and assigns) (other than any transferees of the Option Shares or any permitted transferee of this Agreement pursuant to Section 14(h)) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Severability
 
19
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or Governmental Entity determines that the Option does not permit Grantee to acquire, or does not require Issuer to repurchase, the full number of shares of Issuer Common Stock as provided in Section 2 (as may be adjusted herein), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow Grantee to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any amendment or modification hereof.
               (d) . This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).
Governing Law
               (e) . When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The descriptive headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

               (g) . This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when both counterparts have been signed, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Counterparts
               (h) . Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder or under the Option shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Grantee may assign this Agreement to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Grantee (in which event the term "Grantee" as used herein shall be deemed to refer to such Subsidiary). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (h) shall prohibit Issuer from engaging in a transaction contemplated by Section 7(b) in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(b), provided that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement shall remain applicable with respect to any such transaction.
Assignment
 
20
               (i) . In the event of any exercise of the Option by Grantee, Issuer and Grantee shall execute and deliver all other documents and instruments and take all other action that may be reasonably necessary in order to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise.

The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section shall not constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

          , dated as of January 14, 2004 (this "Agreement"), is made by and between J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO., a Delaware corporation ("Issuer"), and BANK ONE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Grantee").
THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
          , Grantee and Issuer are concurrently herewith entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Grantee will be merged with and into Issuer, with Issuer being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and
WHEREAS
          , as a condition and inducement to Grantee's execution of the Merger Agreement and the Bank One Stock Option Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Grantee has required that Issuer agree, and Issuer has agreed, to grant Grantee the Option (as defined herein).
WHEREAS
          , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Issuer and Grantee agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1.
Defined Terms.
               (a) Capitalized terms which are used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.
               (b) The term "person" shall have the meaning specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
          2. .

          3. .
Exercise of Option
               (a) Grantee may exercise the Option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time following the occurrence of a Purchase Event (as defined in Section 3(b)) on or after the date hereof; provided that the Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of (A) the Effective Time, (B) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof so long as, in the case of this clause (B), a Purchase Event has not occurred and could not occur in the future, (C) the date that Grantee's Total Profit equals $2.87 billion (the "Maximum Profit"), and (D) the date which is six months after the occurrence of a Purchase Event; and provided, further, that any purchase of shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with applicable law; and provided, further, that Grantee shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in Section 3(d)) within six months following such Purchase Event. Notwithstanding the termination of the Option, Grantee shall be entitled to purchase those Option Shares with respect to which it has exercised the Option in accordance herewith prior to the termination of the Option. The termination of the Option shall not affect any rights hereunder which by their terms extend beyond the date of such termination.
               (b) As used herein, a "Purchase Event" means any of the following events:
                    (i) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, without Grantee's prior written consent, Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into one or more agreements with any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) to effect, or shall have effected, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, any Acquisition Proposal;
                    (ii) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than a group of which Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee is a member, shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, shares of Issuer Common Stock or other voting securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC); or
                    (iii) the occurrence of an event the result of which is that the fee required to be paid by Issuer pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(i) or 7.2(b)(ii)(C) or 7.2(b)(iii)(D) of the Merger Agreement becomes payable.
               (c) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Purchase Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of Grantee to exercise the Option.
               (d) In the event Grantee wishes to exercise the Option, Grantee shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which is herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of Option Shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a
 
3
place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing (the "Closing") of such purchase (the date of such Closing, the "Closing Date"); provided that if the Closing cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the need to obtain any necessary approvals or consents of applicable Governmental Entities, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, that if prior notification or application to, approval of or authorization by any Governmental Entity is required in connection with such purchase, Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Grantee in the prompt filing of the required notice or application for approval or authorization, and the Closing shall occur immediately following the date on which such approvals have been obtained and any required notification or waiting periods have expired.
               (e) In the event Grantee receives official notice that an approval or consent of any Governmental Entity required for the purchase of Option Shares will not be issued or granted, Grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option in connection with the resale of Issuer Common Stock or other securities pursuant to a registration statement as provided in Section 10. The provisions of this Section 3 and Section 4 shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any such exercise.
          4.
Payment and Delivery of Certificates.
               (a) On each Closing Date, Grantee shall (i) pay to Issuer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer (provided that the failure or refusal of Issuer to designate a bank account shall not preclude Grantee from exercising the Option), an amount equal to the Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date, and (ii) present and surrender this Agreement to Issuer at the address of Issuer specified in Section 14(f).
               (b) At each Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds and surrender of this Agreement as provided in Section 4(a), (i) Issuer shall deliver to Grantee (A) a certificate or certificates representing the Option Shares to be purchased at such Closing, which Option Shares shall be fully paid, validly issued and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances ("Liens") other than those created by the express terms of this Agreement, and subject to no preemptive or other similar rights, and (B) if the Option is exercised in part only, an executed new agreement with the same terms as this Agreement evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder, and (ii) Grantee shall deliver to Issuer a letter agreeing that Grantee shall not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such Option Shares in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws or of the provisions of this Agreement.
               (c) In addition to any other legend that is required by applicable law, certificates for the Option Shares delivered at each Closing shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows:

THE TRANSFER OF THE STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.
It is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if such Option Shares have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act, such Option Shares have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or Grantee shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, foreign, state, and local taxes and other charges, that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 4(d) in the name of Grantee or its assignee, transferee, or designee.
               (e) Issuer agrees (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from Liens and preemptive or similar rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Issuer Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Issuer Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Issuer Common Stock then outstanding, (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, sale of assets or similar transaction, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, agreements, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer, and (iii) that it will promptly take all action as may from time to time be required (including (A) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements and (B) in the event prior approval or authorization of or notice or application to any Governmental Entity is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with Grantee in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to such Governmental Entities as may be required) in order to permit Grantee to exercise the Option and Issuer to duly and effectively issue shares of Issuer Common Stock pursuant hereto on a timely basis.

(b) Purchase Not for Distribution
          7.
Adjustment upon Changes in Issuer Capitalization, Etc.
               (a) In the event of any change from time to time in Issuer Common Stock or any other shares or securities subject to the Option by reason of a stock dividend, subdivision, spinoff, stock split, split-up, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, or dividend or distribution, other than regular cash dividends, on or in respect of the Issuer Common Stock, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the Option, and the Purchase Price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that Grantee shall receive, upon exercise of the Option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that Grantee would have received in respect of Issuer Common Stock if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. If any additional shares of Issuer Common Stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in the first sentence of this Section 7(a) or upon exercise of the Option), the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, it, together with any shares of Issuer Common Stock previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. No provision of this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect or change, or constitute authorization for any violation of, any of the covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in the Merger Agreement.
 
7
               (b) Without limiting the parties' relative rights, remedies, liabilities and obligations under the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, in the event that, prior to the termination of the Option, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (other than the Merger Agreement) (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for another class or series of stock or other securities of Issuer or any other person or cash or any other property, or the outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock immediately prior to such merger shall, after such merger, represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents having general voting power of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets (or those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of Grantee, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined), (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation, or (z) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), Issuer (such person being referred to as the "Substitute Option Issuer").
               (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option; provided that the exercise price therefor and number of shares subject thereto shall be as set forth in this Section 7 and the repurchase rights relating thereto shall be as set forth in Section 9; providedfurther, that if a Purchase Event shall have occurred prior to or in connection with the issuance of such Substitute Option, the Substitute Option shall be exercisable immediately upon issuance without the occurrence of a further Purchase Event; and provided, further, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to Grantee. Substitute Option Issuer shall also enter into an agreement with Grantee in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
,
               (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the Market/Offer Price (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore exercisable, divided by the Average Price (as hereinafter defined). The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Option Price") shall then be equal to the Purchase Price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
               (e) The following terms have the meanings indicated:
                    (i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (x) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), or at
 
8
Grantee's election, any person that controls such surviving corporation, (y) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving person, or (z) the transferee of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets (or of the assets of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole).
                    (ii) "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (v) the highest price per share of Issuer Common Stock at which a tender offer or an exchange offer therefor has been made, (w) the highest price per share of Issuer Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (x) the price per share of Issuer Common Stock received by holders of Issuer Common Stock in connection with any merger or other business combination transaction described in Section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii), (y) the highest closing price for shares of Issuer Common Stock within the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the merger, consolidation, asset sale or other transaction in question is consummated, and (z) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets (or those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) an amount equal to (I) the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer, as determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee, divided by (II) the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock outstanding at such time. In calculating the Market/Offer Price, in the event that a tender offer or an exchange offer is made for Issuer Common Stock or an agreement is entered into involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities or other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for Issuer Common Stock shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee.
                    (iii) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing sales price per share of a share of Substitute Common Stock quoted on the NYSE (or if Substitute Common Stock is not quoted on the NYSE, the average closing sales price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System or, if the shares of Substitute Common Stock are not quoted thereon, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source) for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of consummation of the consolidation, merger or sale in question; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by Issuer, by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls such person, as Grantee may elect.
                    (iv) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the shares of capital stock (or similar equity interest) with the greatest voting power in respect of the election of directors (or persons similarly responsible for the direction of the business and affairs) of the Substitute Option Issuer.
               (f) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock but for the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f), Substitute Option Issuer shall make a cash payment to Grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this Section 7(f). This
 
9
difference in value shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee.
               (g) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in Section 7(b) unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder and take all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this Section 7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action that may be necessary so that the holders of the other shares of common stock issued by Substitute Option Issuer are not entitled to exercise any rights by reason of the issuance or exercise of the Substitute Option and the shares of Substitute Common Stock are otherwise in no way distinguishable from or have lesser economic value (other than any diminution in value resulting from the fact that the shares of Substitute Common Stock are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor provision) than other shares of common stock issued by Substitute Option Issuer).
          8.
Repurchase at the Option of Grantee.
               (a) At the request of Grantee at any time commencing upon the first occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined in Section 8(c)) and prior to the termination of the Option pursuant to Section 3(a), Issuer (or any successor) shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Option and (y) all shares of Issuer Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on which Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 8 is referred to as the "Request Date". Such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Section 8 Repurchase Consideration") equal to the sum of:
                    (i) the aggregate Purchase Price paid by Grantee for any shares of Issuer Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Option with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership;
                    (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Market/Offer Price for each share of Issuer Common Stock over (y) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7), multiplied by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which the Option has not been exercised; and
                    (iii) the excess, if any, of the Market/Offer Price over the Purchase Price paid (or, in the case of Option Shares with respect to which the Option has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred, payable, as adjusted pursuant to Section 7) by Grantee for each share of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which the Option has been exercised and with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares.
               (b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 8, Issuer shall, within 5 business days after the Request Date, pay the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Issuer the Option and the certificates evidencing the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchased thereunder with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, and Grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are
 
10
then free and clear of all Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, Grantee shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to Section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that Issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of the portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any Governmental Entity disapproves of any part of Issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this Section 8, Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such repurchase) in part but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the Option and/or Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee shall thereupon have the right to exercise the Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the Option was exercisable at the Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case of clause (ii), Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to Grantee that portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering and (y) deliver to Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Issuer Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, or (B) a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the Option shall have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be scheduled to terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the thirtieth business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have the right so to exercise the Option or exercise its rights under this Section 8 until the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall notify Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within 10 business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.
               (c) As used herein, a "Repurchase Event" shall occur if (A) (i) any person (other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any group shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock or (ii) any of the transactions described in Section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) has been consummated and (B) a Purchase Event shall have occurred prior to the termination of the Option.
 
11
          9.
Repurchase of Substitute Option.
               (a) At the request of Grantee at any time prior to the termination of the Substitute Option as set forth in Section 3(a), Substitute Option Issuer (or any successor) shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Substitute Option and (y) all shares of Substitute Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on which Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9 is referred to as the "Section 9 Request Date". Such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Section 9 Repurchase Consideration") equal to the sum of:
                    (i) the aggregate purchase price paid by Grantee for any shares of Substitute Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Option or Substitute Option with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership;
                    (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Substitute Applicable Price (as hereinafter defined) for each share of Substitute Common Stock over (y) the Substitute Option Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7) multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock with respect to which the Substitute Option has not been exercised; and
                    (iii) the excess, if any, of the Substitute Applicable Price over the purchase price paid (or in the case of shares with respect to which the Option or Substitute Option has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred, payable) by Grantee for each share of Substitute Common Stock with respect to which the Option or Substitute Option has been exercised and with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares.
               (b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9, Substitute Option Issuer shall, within 5 business days after the Section 9 Request Date, pay the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Substitute Option Issuer the Substitute Option and the certificates evidencing the shares of Substitute Common Stock purchased thereunder with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, and Grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration, Grantee shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to Section 9, in whole or in part, or to require that Substitute Option Issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of the portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any Governmental Entity disapproves of any part of Substitute Option Issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this Section 9, Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to
 
12
Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Substitute Option Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such repurchase) in part but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the Substitute Option and/or Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee shall thereupon have the right to exercise the Substitute Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the Substitute Option was exercisable at the Section 9 Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the Substitute Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the Substitute Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case of clause (ii), Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to Grantee that portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration that Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering and (y) deliver to Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which is the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration or (B) a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the Substitute Option shall have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be scheduled to terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the 30th business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have the right so to exercise the Substitute Option or exercise its rights under Section 9 until the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall notify Substitute Option Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within 10 business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.
               (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Substitute Applicable Price" means the highest closing sales price per share of Substitute Common Stock during the six months preceding the Section 9 Request Date.
               (d) Following the conversion of the Option into a Substitute Option, all references to "Issuer", "Issuer Common Stock" and "Section 8" contained herein shall also be deemed to be references to "Substitute Option Issuer", "Substitute Common Stock" and "Section 9", respectively.
          10.
Registration Rights.
               . Issuer shall, subject to the conditions of Section 10(c) below, if requested by any Grantee following a Purchase Event that occurs prior to the termination of the Option, including Grantee and any permitted transferee ("Selling Stockholder"), as expeditiously as possible prepare, file and keep current a registration statement under the Securities Act if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of Issuer Common Stock or other securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the Selling Stockholder upon exercise of the Option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the Selling Stockholder in such request, including, without limitation, a "shelf" registration statement under Rule 415 under the

If Issuer at any time after the exercise of the Option proposes to register any shares of Issuer Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with an underwritten public offering of such Issuer Common Stock, Issuer will promptly give written notice to Grantee of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any Selling Stockholder given within 30 days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by the Selling Stockholder), Issuer will cause all such shares for which a Selling Stockholder requests participation in such registration to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that Issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if in the reasonable good faith opinion of the underwriters for such offering, the inclusion of all such shares by the Selling Stockholder would materially interfere with the marketing of such offering (in which case Issuer shall register as many shares as possible without materially interfering with the marketing of the offering), or (ii) in the case of a registration solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on Form S-4 of the Securities Act or any successor Form. If some but not all the shares of Issuer Common Stock with respect to which Issuer shall have received requests for registration pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be excluded from such registration, Issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be registered among the Selling Stockholders desiring to register their shares pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be registered by each such Selling Stockholder bears to the total number of shares requested to be registered by all such Selling Stockholders then desiring to have Issuer Common Stock registered for sale.
(b) Additional Registration Rights
               . Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each registration statement referred to in Section 10(a) above to become effective and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sale or other disposition; provided, however, that Issuer may delay any registration of Option Shares required pursuant to Section 10(a) above for a period not exceeding 90 days provided Issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would adversely affect an offering of other securities by Issuer then in registration, and Issuer shall not be required to register Option Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 10(a) above:
(c) Conditions to Required Registration
                    (i) prior to the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Article VII thereof and (b) a Purchase Event;
                    (ii) on more than three occasions;
                    (iii) within 90 days after the effective date of a registration referred to in Section 10(b) above pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder or Selling Stockholders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register all such shares under the Securities Act and shares were registered to the extent requested; and
 
14
                    (iv) unless a request therefor is made to register at least 25% or more of the aggregate number of Option Shares (including shares of Issuer Common Stock and other securities issuable upon exercise of the Option) then outstanding.
          In addition to the foregoing, Issuer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement (other than a shelf registration statement referred to in Section 10(a)) after the expiration of three months from the effective date of such registration statement. Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of the Option Shares so registered in accordance with the intended method of distribution for such shares; provided, however, that Issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. If requested by any such Grantee in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements. Upon receiving any request under this Section 10 from any Grantee, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 10, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies.
          Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 10, in lieu of complying with its obligations pursuant to a request made by any Grantee under this Section 10, Issuer may, at its election, repurchase the Option Shares requested to be registered by such Grantee at a purchase price per share equal to the average closing price of such Option Shares during the 10 business days preceding the date on which Issuer gives notice to Grantee of its intention to repurchase such Option Shares (which notice shall be given no later than 15 days after Grantee has given notice to Issuer of its election to exercise its registration rights under Section 10(a) or 10(b)).
               . Except where applicable state law prohibits such payments and except for underwriting discounts or commissions and brokers' fees, Issuer will pay all expenses (including, without limitation, registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel), legal fees and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose Option Shares are being registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions but including liability insurance if Issuer so desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above (including the related offerings and sales by holders of Option Shares) and all other qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above.
(d) Expenses
               . In connection with any registration under Section 10(a) or 10(b) above, Issuer hereby indemnifies the Selling Stockholders, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such Selling Stockholders or underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and including each director, officer, stockholder, partner, member, employee, representative and agent of any thereof, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue,
(e) Indemnification
 
15
statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement that was included by Issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to Issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and Issuer and each person, if any, who controls Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each director, officer, stockholder, partner, member, employee, representative and agent of Issuer shall be indemnified by such Selling Stockholders, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement, that was included by Issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to Issuer by such Selling Stockholders or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use.
          Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 10(e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this Section 10(e), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this Section 10(e) unless the failure so to notify the indemnified party results in substantial prejudice thereto. In case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees and expenses of such counsel. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
          If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10(e) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Issuer, the Selling
 
16
Stockholders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of Issuer, the Selling Stockholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall any Selling Stockholder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its Option Shares included in the offering. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Any obligation by any Selling Stockholder to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other Selling Stockholders.
          In connection with any registration pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above, Issuer and each Selling Stockholder (other than Grantee) shall enter into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of this Section 10(e).
               . Issuer shall comply with all reporting requirements and will do all such other things as may be necessary to permit the expeditious sale at any time of any Option Shares by the Selling Stockholders thereof in accordance with and to the extent permitted by any rule or regulation promulgated by the SEC from time to time, including, without limitation, Rule 144. Issuer shall at its expense provide the Selling Stockholders with any information necessary in connection with the completion and filing of any reports or forms required to be filed by them under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or required pursuant to any state securities laws or the rules of the NASD or any stock exchange.
(f) Miscellaneous Reporting
               . Issuer will pay all stamp taxes in connection with the issuance and the sale of the Option Shares and in connection with the exercise of the Option, and will save the Selling Stockholders harmless, without limitation as to time, against any and all liabilities with respect to all such taxes.
(g) Issue Taxes
          11. If Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be acquired in connection with the exercise of the Option are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the NYSE, the Nasdaq National Market System or any other securities exchange or securities quotation system, Issuer, upon the request of Grantee, will promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation or trading or listing the shares of Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the Option on such securities exchange or securities quotation system and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation or listing as soon as practicable.
Quotation or Listing.
          12. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder, in which event, (i) the "Maximum Profit" in each agreement resulting from such exchange shall be allocated among the
Division of Option.
 
17
several agreements in proportion to the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant thereto so that the sum of the "Maximum Profit" for all such agreements shall total $2.87 billion, (ii) the amount referred to in clause (D) of Section 13(b) of each agreement resulting from such exchange shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to each such agreement and the denominator of which is the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to all such agreements collectively and (iii) such other adjustments, if any, shall be made as are necessary to preserve the overall economic impact and intent of this Agreement (including Section 13 hereof). The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any other Stock Option Agreement and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification to protect Issuer from any loss which it may suffer if this Agreement is replaced, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date.
          13. . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Merger Agreement, in no event shall Grantee's Total Profit (as defined below) exceed the Maximum Profit, and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, Grantee, at its sole discretion, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares subject to the Option (and any Substitute Option), (ii) deliver to Issuer, or the Substitute Issuer, as the case may be, for cancellation shares of Issuer Common Stock or Substitute Common Stock, as the case may be (or other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged), (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or the Substitute Issuer, as the case may be, (iv) reduce the amount of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration or Section 9 Repurchase Consideration or (v) any combination of the foregoing, so that Grantee's actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed the Maximum Profit after taking into account the foregoing actions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than the Maximum Profit and, if exercise of the Option would otherwise result in the Notional Total Profit exceeding such amount, Grantee, in its discretion, may take any of the actions specified in this Section 13(a) so that the Notional Total Profit shall not exceed the Maximum Profit; provided that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any subsequent exercise of the Option which at such time complies with this sentence.
Limitation of Grantee Profit
               (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Total Profit" shall mean: (i) the aggregate amount (before taxes) of (A) the excess of (x) the net cash amounts or fair market value of any property received by Grantee pursuant to a sale of Option Shares (or securities into which such shares are converted or exchanged), other than to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Grantee, or a repurchase of Option Shares by Issuer pursuant to Section 8 hereof, after payment of applicable brokerage or sales commissions and discounts, over (y) Grantee's aggregate purchase price for such Option Shares (or other securities), plus (B) all amounts received by Grantee upon the repurchase of the Option by Issuer pursuant to Section 8 hereof, plus (C) all equivalent net amounts with respect to the Substitute Option and any amounts paid pursuant to Section 7(f) hereof, plus (D) all amounts received by Grantee pursuant to Section 7.2(b) of the Merger Agreement, minus (ii) all amounts of cash previously paid to Issuer pursuant to Section 13(a) plus the value of the Option Shares (or other securities) previously delivered to Issuer for cancellation pursuant to Section 13(a), which value shall be deemed to be the aggregate Purchase
 
18
Price paid for such Option Shares (or other securities). For purposes of this Agreement, "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise the Option shall be the Total Profit, determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that the Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares, and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Issuer Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). For purposes of this Section 13, transactions by a wholly-owned Subsidiary transferee of Grantee in respect of the Option or Option Shares transferred to it shall be treated as if made by Grantee.
               (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the ability of Grantee to receive, nor relieve Issuer's obligation to pay, any payment provided for in Section 7.2(b) of the Merger Agreement; provided that if and to the extent the Total Profit received by Grantee would exceed the Maximum Profit following receipt of such payment, Grantee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of Section 13(a) within 15 days of the date on which Grantee has realized cash and/or property representing Total Profit in excess of Maximum Profit.
          14.

If for any reason such court or Governmental Entity determines that the Option does not permit Grantee to acquire, or does not require Issuer to repurchase, the full number of shares of Issuer Common Stock as provided in Section 2 (as may be adjusted herein), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow Grantee to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any amendment or modification hereof.

NEW YORK and CHICAGO, January 14, 2004  J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Bank One Corporation (NYSE: ONE) today announced that they have agreed to merge in a strategic business combination establishing the second largest banking franchise in the United States, based on core deposits. The combined company will have assets of $1.1 trillion, a strong capital base, 2,300 branches in seventeen states and top-tier positions in retail banking and lending, credit cards, investment banking, asset management, private banking, treasury and securities services, middle-market, and private equity. With balanced earnings contributions from retail and wholesale banking, the combined company will be well-positioned to achieve strong and stable financial performance and increase shareholder value through its balanced business mix, greater scale, and enhanced efficiencies and competitiveness.
 
 2
The agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, provides for a stock-for-stock merger in which 1.32 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock will be exchanged, on a tax-free basis, for each share of Bank One common stock. Based on JPMorgan Chase's closing price of $39.22 on Wednesday, January 14, 2004, the transaction would have a value of approximately $51.77 for each share of Bank One common stock, and would create an enterprise with a combined market capitalization of approximately $130 billion. The premium, based upon the average closing stock prices of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One for the previous month, would be approximately 8 percent and would be approximately 14 percent based on today's closing prices.
Under the agreement, the combined company will be headed by William B. Harrison, 60, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and by James Dimon, 47, as President and Chief Operating Officer, with Mr. Dimon to succeed Mr. Harrison as CEO in 2006 and Mr. Harrison continuing to serve as Chairman. The company's sixteen-member Board of Directors will have fourteen outside directors, seven each from JPMorgan Chase and Bank One, plus Messrs. Harrison and Dimon.
The combined company's senior management team will also include an Office of the Chairman, composed of Messrs. Harrison and Dimon; Donald H. Layton, Vice Chairman (Finance, Risk & Technology); and David A. Coulter, Vice Chairman (Investment Banking and Investment Management & Private Banking).
Other senior executives of the combined company, who will serve on the firm's Executive Committee, and their areas of responsibility include: Austin Adams, Technology; Linda Bammann, Risk  Deputy; Steven D. Black, Equities; James S. Boshart III, Middle Market; William Campbell, Card Chairman; David E. Donovan, Retail Branches; Dina Dublon, Finance;

Lee, Investment Banking; Jay Mandelbaum, Strategy; William H. McDavid, Legal; Heidi Miller, Treasury and Security Services; Stephen J. Rotella, Mortgage; John W. Schmidlin, Technology; Charles W. Scharf, Retail Banking and Lending; Richard J. Srednicki, Card CEO; James E. Staley, Investment Management & Private Bank; Jeffrey C. Walker, Private Equity; Don M. Wilson III, Risk; and William T. Winters, Credit & Rates.
The merged company will be known as J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. It will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol JPM. Its corporate headquarters will be located in New York. The retail financial services business, which includes the consumer banking, small business banking, and consumer lending activities with the exception of credit card, will be headquartered in Chicago. Chicago will also serve as the headquarters for the middle market business.
The JPMorgan brand will continue to be used for the wholesale business. Bank One and Chase are both strong, respected retail brands. The combined company will continue to use both brands in their respective markets and products, while research is conducted to determine a long-term retail brand strategy.
It is expected that cost savings of $2.2 billion (pre-tax) will be achieved over a three-year period. The combined enterprise will have excess capital, and is expected to continue to generate significant free cash flow. Giving pro forma effect to anticipated cost savings and stock repurchases, the transaction is expected to be accretive to 2005 GAAP and cash earnings per share. Merger-related costs are expected to be $3 billion (pre-tax).

Under the merger agreement, and subject to Bank One board approval, Bank One expects to declare an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share.
William B. Harrison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase, said: "This landmark transaction will create one of the world's great financial services companiesa powerful enterprise well-positioned to generate significant value for our shareholders, customers and communities. We will have a trillion-dollar-plus asset base; one of the broadest and deepest product mixes globally; and a dynamic, talented management team. In addition, with our balance of consumer and wholesale business, the combined company will achieve greater earnings consistency. My colleagues and I look forward to working with Jamie Dimon and his colleagues to bring the unique benefits of this merger to all of our constituencies."
James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bank One, said: "The merger of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase makes tremendous sense strategically, operationally and financially. I've known Bill Harrison for many years, and have tremendous respect for him personally and professionally. Together, we have a strong management team that can compete with the best. We will be a major provider of both consumer and commercial banking services in the United States and a leader in investment banking and wealth management globally, with a strong balance sheet and an intense focus on performance and execution. Our retail and wholesale businesses and our geographies complement each other, and our respective earnings contributions provide near-perfect balance. We are also excited about the opportunities we will have to continue to build our strong franchise in the Midwest, with Chicago as a vibrant financial center. Our combined company will have the size, scale, product mix, customer base, distribution channels, and earnings stability to achieve outstanding results, and enhanced shareholder value for many years to come."
