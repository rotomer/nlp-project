(d)
Within a reasonable time after each date on which the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented to include additional financial information or any document that contains additional financial information, such as a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, shall be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, the Company shall cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or KPMG LLP, as the case may be, to furnish each Agent with a letter, addressed jointly to the Board of Directors of the Company and the Agents and dated such date, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E; provided, however, that within a reasonable time after the filing with the Commission of each Annual Report of the Company on Form 10-K, the Company shall instead furnish each Agent with a letter addressed jointly to the Board of Directors of the Company and the Agents and dated such date, to the effect set forth in Section 6(f) or 6(g), as the case may be, insofar as Section 6(f) or 6(g), as the case may be, relates to such additional financial information; provided further, that the Company shall not be required during any period in which it has instructed each Agent to cease or each Agent has ceased soliciting offers to purchase Program Securities to furnish each Agent with either letter referred to above in the this paragraph, provided that the obligation of each Agent with either letter referred to above in this paragraph, provided that the obligation of each Agent to begin thereafter to solicit offers to purchase Program Securities shall be subject to the delivery of (i) such letter substantially in the form of Exhibit E with respect to the period commencing with the beginning of the first fiscal quarter following the date of the most recent Annual Report of the Company on Form 10-K and ending with the end of the most recent fiscal quarter or, if later, the period as to which the Company would, but for this proviso, be required to furnish such a letter and (ii) such letter to the effect set forth in Section 6(f) or 6(g), as the case may be, with respect to the most recent Annual Report of the Company on Form 10-K.

8.
 
Indemnification and Contribution.
     
(a)
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act against
 
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus relating to the Program Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse each Agent and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided
, that the Company will not be liable to an Agent or person controlling such Agent in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein; and , that with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus relating to the Program Securities, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Agent (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Agent) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Program Securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Agent or such controlling person results from the fact that a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to any person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Program Securities to such person (provided that such Prospectus did not contain any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission and such Prospectus was delivered to such Agent by the Company on a timely basis enabling such Agent so to send or give a copy of such Prospectus in accordance with such Agent's customary procedures). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
however,
provided further
     
(b)
Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus relating to the Program Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
 
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have.
     
(c)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnifying party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
     
(d)
If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution for liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any Agent on the other from the offering by it pursuant to this Agreement of the Program Securities that are the subject of the action (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of
 
this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the commissions or underwriting discounts received by such Agent relating to the Program Securities that are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through it pursuant to this Agreement or upon resale of Program Securities purchased by it from the Company exceed the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Agents' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations hereunder and are not joint.
      9.
 
Status of Each Agent.
In soliciting offers to purchase Program
Securities pursuant to this Agreement and in performing its other obligations hereunder each Agent is acting individually and not jointly with the other Agents and, except as contemplated by Section 4, is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Program Securities from the Company has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but shall have no liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated. If the Company shall default in the performance of its obligation to deliver Program Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default and (ii) pay to each Agent any commission to which it would have been entitled had such Program Securities been delivered.
     
10.
Survival of Representations and Obligations.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, as the case may be, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as to the results thereof made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Program Securities. If this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5(h) to the extent actually incurred by or committed to by an Agent to the date of such termination, the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(b) shall remain in effect until the settlement of all pending deliveries of and payment for securities and the respective obligations of the Company and the Agents pursuant to Section 8 and the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(d) shall remain in effect.
     
11.
Termination.
(a) The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Program Securities under this Agreement at any time. The Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement.
 
Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than one day's written notice of termination to all of the Agents, or, in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than one day's written notice of termination to the Company. The provisions of Sections 5(b), 5(d), 5(h), 8, and 10 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
     
(b)
Any Terms Agreement executed pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement shall be subject to termination, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for all the Program Securities, if (a) prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) trading in the common stock of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by Federal or New York authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis having an adverse effect on the financial markets of the United States and (b) the occurrence or consequences of any one or more of such events shall have, in the judgment of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., made it impracticable to market the Program Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus. The provisions of Sections 5(b), 5(d), 5(h), 8, and 10 hereof shall survive any termination of the Terms Agreement.
     
(c)
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement with respect to any Agent, such Agent shall not receive any compensation except in connection with a purchase by it of Program Securities actually consummated, provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit the provisions of Section 8, and that reimbursement by the Company to an Agent of out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred by such Agent and to which such Agent is otherwise entitled as provided herein shall not be prohibited.
     
12.
Offering Restrictions
. If any Program Securities are to be offered outside the United States, you will not offer or sell any such Program Securities in any jurisdiction if such offer or sale would not be in compliance with any applicable law or regulation or if any consent, approval or permission is needed for such offer or sale by you or for or on behalf of the Company unless such consent, approval or permission has been previously obtained. Subject to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement, the Company shall have no responsibility for, and you will obtain, any consent, approval or permission required by you for the subscription, offer, sale or delivery by you of Program Securities, or the distribution of any offering materials, under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which you are subject or in or from which you make any subscription, offer, sale or delivery.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has previously entered into a Master Agency Agreement dated May 7, 2004 (the "Master Agency Agreement"), among the Company and the other agents signatory thereto (the "Existing Agents"), with respect to the issue and sale from time to time by the Company of up to $1,000,000,000 less the initial public offering price of any securities previously issued under the Registration Statement (or the equivalent thereof in one or more currencies other than U.S. dollars) aggregate initial public offering price of its Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E, due more than nine months from the date of issue (the "Notes"), its Global Warrants, Series E (the "Warrants") and its Global Units, Series E (the "Units" and, together with the Notes and the Warrants, the "Program Securities"). The Notes will be issued either alone or as part of a Unit under the Indenture dated as of May 25, 2001, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the " Trustee") (as may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Indenture"). The Master Agency Agreement permits the Company to appoint one or more additional persons to act as agent with respect to the Program Securities, on terms substantially the same as those contained in the Master Agency Agreement. A copy of the Master Agency Agreement, including the Procedures with respect to the issuance of the Program Securities attached thereto as Exhibit C, is attached hereto.
     
In accordance with Section 3(c) of the Master Agency Agreement we hereby confirm that, with effect from the date hereof, you shall become a party to, and an Agent under, the Master Agency Agreement, vested with all the authority, rights and powers, and subject to all duties and obligations of an Agent as if originally named as such under the Master Agency Agreement.
     
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms used herein which are defined in the Master Agency Agreement shall have the same meanings as in the Master Agency Agreement. Your obligation to act as Agent hereunder shall be subject to you
 
having received copies of the most recent documents (including any prior documents referred to therein) previously delivered to the Existing Agents pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 of the Master Agency Agreement. By your signature below, you confirm that such documents are to your satisfaction. For purposes of Section 12 of the Master Agency Agreement, you confirm that your notice details are as set forth immediately beneath your signature.
     
Each of the parties to this letter agrees to perform its respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of the parties in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Master Agency Agreement and the Procedures, as amended or supplemented hereby.
     
Notwithstanding anything in the Master Agency Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of each of the Existing Agents and the Additional Agent(s) under Section 8 of the Master Agency Agreement are several and not joint, and in no case shall any Existing Agent or Additional Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among them) be responsible under Section 8(d) to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by such Existing Agent or Additional Agent from the offering of the Program Securities.
     
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and the executed counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
     
If the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement among the parties hereto, please indicate your acceptance hereof in the space provided for that purpose below.

The offering of Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E, due more than nine months from the date of issue (the "Notes"), Global Warrants, Series E (the "Warrants") and Global Units, Series E (the "Units" and, together with the Notes and the Warrants, the "Program Securities") are to be offered on a continuing basis by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (the "Company"). Pursuant to the Company's Master Agency Agreement dated May 7, 2004 (the "Master Agency Agreement") between the Company and the Agents to which these administrative procedures are attached as an exhibit, certain firms and corporations (each an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents") have agreed, as agents of the Company, to solicit purchases of the Program Securities issued in fully registered form. The Program Securities are being sold by the Company to the Agents pursuant to the Master Agency Agreement and, if applicable, one or more terms agreements substantially in the form attached to the Master Agency Agreement as Exhibit D, D-1, and D-2 (each a "Terms Agreement"). The Program Securities have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The Notes will be issued, either alone or as part of a Unit, under the Indenture dated as of May 25, 2001, as amended from time to time, (as may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company) ("Deutsche Bank"), as trustee (the "Trustee").
     
The Warrants will be issued, either alone or as part of a Unit, pursuant to the provisions of a Warrant Agreement between the Company and a warrant agent to be appointed by the Company, substantially in the form of one of the agreements filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to below (each a "Warrant Agreement").
     
The Units will be issued pursuant to a Unit Agreement among the Company and a unit agent to be appointed by the Company substantially in the form of the agreement filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement (each a "Unit Agreement"). Units may include one or more (i) Notes, (ii) Warrants or (iii) any combination thereof. The applicable Pricing Supplement will specify whether the Notes and/or Warrants comprised by a Unit may or may not be separated from the Unit.
     
Deutsche Bank will be the Registrar, Calculation Agent, Authenticating Agent and Paying Agent for the Notes, and will perform the duties specified herein. For the purposes of these Administrative Procedures, Deutsche Bank shall also refer to any designee of Deutsche Bank under the Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent and
 
Authenticating Agreement. Each Note, each Warrant and each Unit will be represented by, in the case of the Notes, a Global Note, in the case of the Warrants, a Global Warrant, and in the case of the Units, a Global Unit (each as defined below) delivered to Deutsche Bank, as agent for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC (in the case of a Note, a "Book-Entry Note," in the case of a Warrant, a "Book-Entry Warrant," and, in the case of a Unit, a "Book-Entry Unit"). Each Note or Warrant which may be included in any Unit will be issued in the corresponding global form. Except as set forth in the Indenture, in the case of Notes, any Warrant Agreement, in the case of Warrants or any Unit Agreement, in the case of Units, an owner of a Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or Book-Entry Unit (or of any Note or Warrant included in such Book-Entry Unit), as the case may be, will not be entitled to receive a Certificated Note (including with respect to a Book-Entry Note included in a Book-Entry Unit), a Certificated Warrant (including with respect to a Book-Entry Warrant included in a Book-Entry Unit) or a Certificated Unit.
     
The procedures to be followed during, and the specific terms of, the solicitation of orders by the Agents and the sale as a result thereof by the Company are explained below. The Company will advise the Agents and Deutsche Bank in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents and Deutsche Bank are to communicate regarding orders to purchase the Program Securities and the details of their delivery.
     
Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants and Book-Entry Units, which may be payable in either U.S. dollars or other specified currencies, will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth herein as they may subsequently be amended as the result of changes in DTC's operating procedures. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, the Unit Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants and the Units shall be used herein as therein defined. The Company will advise the Agent in writing of the employees of the Company with whom the Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Program Securities and the related settlement details. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the provisions of the Program Securities, the Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, the Unit Agreement, DTC's operating requirements or the Master Agency Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Program Securities, the Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, the Unit Agreement, DTC's operating requirements and the Master Agency Agreement shall control.
     
In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants or Book-Entry Units for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, Deutsche Bank will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below. Deutsche Bank will perform such functions in accordance with (i) its obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company to DTC dated as of [           ], and (ii) its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").
 
Issuance:
On any date of settlement (as defined under "Settlement" below) for one or more Book-Entry Notes, one or more Book-Entry Warrants or one or more Book-Entry Units, the Company will issue, in the case of the Notes, a single global Note in fully registered form without coupons (a "Global Note") representing up to U.S. $500,000,000 principal amount of all such Notes that have the same Original Issue Date, Maturity Date and other terms, and, in the case of the Warrants, a single global Warrant in fully registered form (a "Global Warrant"), with a notional amount of up to U.S. $500,000,000 that have the same Exercise Price, Exercise Date, Exercise Period, Expiration Date and other terms, and in the case of Units, a single global unit in fully registered form (a "Global Unit"), representing up to U.S. $500,000,000 face amount that have the same Original Issue Date and that otherwise comprise the same securities and have the same terms. Each Global Note and each Global Warrant, whether issued alone or as part of a Unit, will be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication, or countersignature as the case may be, by Deutsche Bank and each Global Unit will be dated and issued as of the date of the issuances of the other securities comprised by such Unit. Each Global Note, whether issued alone or as part of a Unit, will bear an "Interest Accrual Date," which will be (i) with respect to an original Global Note (or any portion thereof), its original issuance date and (ii) with respect to any Global Note (or any portion thereof) issued subsequently upon exchange of a Global Note, or in lieu of a destroyed, lost or stolen Global Note, the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the predecessor Global Note or Notes (or if no such payment or provision has been made, the original issuance date of the predecessor Global Note), regardless of the date of authentication of such subsequently issued Global Note. Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants and Book-Entry Units may be payable in either U.S. dollars or other specified currencies. No Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit will represent, any Certificated Note, Certificated Warrant or
 
Certificated Unit, as the case may be.
Preparation of Pricing
Supplement:
If any order to purchase a Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or Book-Entry Unit is accepted by or on behalf of the Company, the Company will prepare a pricing supplement (a "Pricing Supplement") reflecting the terms of such Note, Warrant or Unit. The Company (i) will arrange to file an electronic format document, in the manner prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual, of such Pricing Supplement with the Commission in accordance with the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and (ii) will, as soon as possible and in any event not later than the date on which such Pricing Supplement is filed with the Commission, deliver the number of copies of such Pricing Supplement to the Agent as the Agent shall request. The Agent will cause such Pricing Supplement to be delivered to the purchaser of the Note, Warrant or Unit.
In each instance that a Pricing Supplement is prepared, the Agent will affix the Pricing Supplement to Prospectuses prior to their use. Outdated Pricing Supplements, and the Prospectuses to which they are attached (other than those retained for files), will be destroyed.
Note Maturities

Each Book-Entry Note will mature on a date not less than nine months or more than thirty years after the Original Issue Date for such Note.
Denominations
:
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, Book-Entry Notes will be issued in principal amounts of U.S. $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 or, if such Book-Entry Notes are issued in a currency other than U.S. dollars, principal amounts of such currency in denominations of the equivalent of U.S. $1,000 (rounded to an integral multiple of 1,000 units of such currency), unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Global Notes, Global Warrants and Global Units will be denominated in, in the case of Global Notes, principal amounts not in excess of U.S. $500,000,000, in the case of Global Warrants, in aggregate notional amounts not to exceed U.S. $500,000,000, and, in the case of Global Units, in
 
aggregate face amounts not to exceed U.S. $500,000,000. If one or more Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of U.S. $500,000,000, or one or more Book-Entry Warrants having an aggregate notional amount in excess of U.S. $500,000,000, or one or more Book-Entry Units having an aggregate face amount in excess of U.S. $500,000,000 would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit, as the case may be, then one Global Note will be issued to represent each U.S. $500,000,000 principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes, one Global Warrant will be issued to represent each aggregate notional amount of U.S. $500,000,000 of such Book-Entry Warrant or Warrants, and one Global Unit will be issued to represent each aggregate face amount of U.S. $500,000,000 of such Book-Entry Unit or Units and an additional Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit, will be issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes, aggregate notional amount of such Book-Entry Warrant or Warrants or aggregate face amount of such Book-Entry Unit or Units. In such a case, each of the Global Notes, Global Warrants or Global Units representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes, such Book-Entry Warrant or Warrants, or such Book-Entry Unit or Units, as the case may be, shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.
Delivery of Confirmation and
Prospectus to Purchaser by
each Agent:
Subject to "Suspension of Solicitation; Amendment or Supplement" below, each Agent and participating Dealer, pursuant to the terms of the Master Agency Agreement and as herein described, will cause to be delivered a copy of the Prospectus, including the applicable Pricing Supplement, to each purchaser of Program Securities from such Agent or Dealer.
For each offer to purchase a Program Security solicited by any Agent and accepted by or on behalf of the Company, such Agent will issue a confirmation to the purchaser, setting forth the details described above and delivery and payment instructions.
 
In addition, such Agent will deliver to purchasers of the Program Securities the Prospectus, including the applicable Pricing Supplement, in relation to such Program Security prior to or simultaneously with delivery of the confirmation of sale and delivery of the Program Security.
Suspension of Solicitation;
Amendment or Supplement:
Subject to the Company's representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Master Agency Agreement, the Company may instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of orders to purchase Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants or Book-Entry Units. Upon receipt of such instructions, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation until such time as the Company has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed.
In the event that at the time the Company suspends solicitation of purchases there shall be any orders outstanding for settlement, the Company will promptly advise the Agents and the Bank whether such orders may be settled and whether copies of the Prospectus as in effect at the time of the suspension, together with the appropriate Pricing Supplement, may be delivered in connection with the settlement of such orders. The Company will have the sole responsibility for such decision and for any arrangement that may be made in the event that the Company determines that such orders may not be settled or that copies of such Prospectus may not be so delivered.
If the Company decides to amend or supplement the Registration Statement (as defined in the Master Agency Agreement) or the Prospectus, it will promptly advise the Agents and furnish the Agents with the proposed amendment or supplement and with such certificates and opinions as are required, all to the extent required by and in accordance with the terms of the Master Agency Agreement. Subject to the provisions of the Master Agency Agreement, the Company may file with the Commission any such supplement to the Prospectus relating to the Program Securities. The Company will provide the Agents and Deutsche Bank with copies of any such supplement, and confirm to the
 
Agents that such supplement has been filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b).

If a sale is to be settled more than one Business Day after the sale date, Settlement Procedures "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E" shall be completed as soon as practicable but no later than 11:00 A.M., 11:00 A.M., 11:00 A.M., 12 Noon and 2:00 P.M., respectively, on the first Business Day after the sale date. If the Initial Interest Rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Note, whether issued alone or as part of a Unit, has not been determined at the time that "Settlement Procedure" "A" is completed, "Settlement Procedure" "D" and "E" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 12 Noon and 2:00 P.M., respectively, on the Business Day before the settlement date.

If settlement of a Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or a Book-Entry Unit is rescheduled or canceled, Deutsche Bank, after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent, will deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 P.M. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled settlement date.
Failure to Settle
:
If Deutsche Bank fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or a Book-Entry Unit pursuant to Settlement Procedure "H", Deutsche Bank may upon the written request of the Company deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing DTC to debit such Note, Warrant or Unit to Deutsche Bank's participant account, provided that Deutsche Bank's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Note representing such Note, an aggregate notional amount of the Global Warrant representing such Warrant, or an aggregate face amount of the Global Unit representing such Unit that is at least equal to the principal amount, notional amount or face amount to be debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to
 
all the Book-Entry Notes represented by a Global Note, all the Book-Entry Warrants represented by a Global Warrant or all the Book-Entry Units represented by a Global Unit, Deutsche Bank will mark such Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit "canceled," make appropriate entries in Deutsche Bank's records and send such canceled Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit to the Company. The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit shall, in accordance with the procedures of the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation, be canceled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Notes represented by a Global Note, with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Warrants represented by a Global Warrant, or with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Units represented by a Global Unit, Deutsche Bank will exchange such Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit, as the case may be, for two Global Notes, for two Global Warrants or for two Global Units, as the case may be, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Note or Notes, such Book-Entry Warrant or Warrants or such Book-Entry Unit or Units and shall be canceled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants or Book-Entry Units previously represented by the surrendered Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Note, Global Warrant or Global Unit.
If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or Book-Entry Unit is not timely paid to the Participants with respect to such Note, Warrant or Unit by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or any person, including an indirect participant in DTC, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such Participants and, in turn, the Agent may enter SDFS deliver orders through DTC's Participant Terminal System reversing the orders entered pursuant to Settlement Procedures "H" and "I", respectively. Thereafter, Deutsche Bank will deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Note, Book-Entry Warrant or Book-Entry Unit, DTC may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect.
 
In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Notes, Book-Entry Warrants or Book-Entry Units to have been represented by a Global Note, a Global Warrant or a Global Unit, as the case may be, Deutsche Bank will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedures "F" and "H", for the authentication and issuance of a Global Note representing the Book-Entry Notes to be represented by such Global Note, for the issuance of a Global Warrant representing the Book-Entry Warrants to be represented by such Global Warrant and for the issuance of a Global Unit representing the Book-Entry Units to be represented by such Global Unit and, in each case, will make appropriate entries in its records.

Calculation Agent shall be entitled to receive, copies of any relevant records maintained by such predecessor Calculation Agent.
