Effective July 1, 2004, Bank One Corporation ("Bank One"), merged with and into JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 14, 2004. Bank One's results of operations will be included in the Firm's results beginning July 1, 2004.
The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information contained in Exhibit 99.1 is being furnished pursuant to Regulation FD in order to assist investors in understanding (i) how the financial information of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One may have appeared on a combined basis had the two companies actually been merged as of the earliest date indicated and (ii) how the financial information of the lines of business of the new combined company may have appeared had the two companies actually been merged as of the earliest date indicated.
The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information included in Exhibit 99.1 does not necessarily indicate the combined results of operations or the combined financial position of the Firm that would have resulted had the merger actually been completed at the beginning of the applicable periods presented nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the Firm. The information presented is intended to be supplementary financial information only and is not intended to be incorporated by reference into registration statements or reports filed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the case may be.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information contained in this document is being furnished pursuant to Regulation FD in order to assist investors in understanding (i) how the financial information of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corporation may have appeared on a combined basis had the two companies actually been merged as of the earliest date indicated and (ii) how the financial information of the lines of business of the new combined company may have appeared had the two companies actually been merged as of the earliest date indicated.
The information presented is intended to be supplementary financial information only and is not intended to be incorporated by reference into registration statements or reports filed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the case may be.
     The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm") and Bank One Corporation ("Bank One"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     The pro forma historical lines of business information present the seven new business segments of the combined company as if these segments had existed for the combined company as of the earliest date indicated. See the Executive Summary on pages 2-7 for more information on the composition of the new business segments.
     In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the line-of-business results on an "operating basis," which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. In the case of IB, operating basis includes in Trading revenue the NII related to trading activities. Trading activities generate revenues which are recorded for U.S. GAAP purposes in two line items on the income statement: Trading revenue, which includes the mark-to-market gains or losses on trading positions; and Net interest income, which includes the interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining, for operating basis purposes, both the trading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluate IB's trading activities by considering all revenue related to these activities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. In the case of Card Services, operating or managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of "managed receivables" to evaluate the credit performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower's credit performance will impact both the receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Finally, operating basis excludes the Merger costs and the Litigation reserve charge, as management believes these items are not part of the Firm's normal daily business operations (and therefore not indicative of trends), and do not provide meaningful comparisons with other periods.
     The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information include (i) purchase price adjustments as of July 1, 2004 to reflect the merger as of such date of Bank One with JPMorgan Chase, (ii) estimated adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of Bank One at their respective fair values as of July 1, 2004, and (iii) adjustments for changes in management accounting policies. For more information about these purchase price and fair value adjustments reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A1 filed by JPMorgan Chase on July 30, 2004 (as amended by Form 8-K/A2 filed by JPMorgan Chase on August 13, 2004 which includes Bank One's financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2004), which Current Report contained pro forma financial information reflecting the consummation on July 1, 2004, of the merger of the two companies.
     The unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only.
This information does not include:
   (i)   the impact of the sale of the Bank One corporate trust business to JPMorgan Chase;
   (ii)  any future cost savings anticipated from the merger (including without limitation the previously announced $3.0 billion (pre-tax) of cost savings);
   (iii) merger-related costs anticipated to be incurred to combine the operations of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One, post June 30, 2004;
   (iv) the impact of possible future revenue enhancements or share repurchases.
   Reclassifications of prior periods included in these pro forma combined historical financial statements reflect the conformity of certain management accounting policies as disclosed in the Executive Summary on pages 2-7; additional conformity of accounting policies and further reclassifications may be made in the future.
For the reasons stated above, the unaudited pro forma combined historical financial information included in this document does not necessarily indicate the combined results of operations or the combined financial position of the company that would have resulted had the merger actually been completed at the beginning of the applicable periods presented nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the company.
