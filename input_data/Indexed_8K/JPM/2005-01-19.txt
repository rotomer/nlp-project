On January 19, 2005, JPMorgan Chase Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm") held an investor presentation to review 2004 fourth quarter earnings.
Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of slides furnished at, and posted on the Firm's website in connection with, the presentation. The slides are being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 and the information contained therein shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Firm under the Securities Act of 1933.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
The presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected and the risk that excess capital is not generated from the merger as anticipated or not utilized in an accretive manner. Additional factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2004, June 30, 2004 and March 31, 2004, and in the 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K of JPMorgan Chase filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's Internet site ().
