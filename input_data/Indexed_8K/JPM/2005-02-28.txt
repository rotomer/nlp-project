Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On January 18, 2005, the Compensation & Management Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMC") approved several compensation actions with respect to the named executive officers of JPMC as of December 31, 2004. The Board ratified the recommendations for Messrs. Harrison and Dimon. These actions are summarized in the table below:
(1) None of the named executive officers received a salary increase from January 1, 2004 through the date of this filing.
(2) Includes amount paid or deferred.
(3)
Awarded as restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs granted equals the value set forth above divided by $37.47, which was the average of the high and low selling prices of JPMC common stock on January 20, 2005, rounded up to the next whole unit. The RSUs vest as follows: 50% 2 years after grant and 50% 3 years after grant. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of stock on the vesting date and dividend equivalents for any dividends paid. RSUs have no voting rights.
(4) Awarded as stock appreciation rights (SARs) to be settled in shares of JPMC common stock. The grant price of the SARs is $37.47, which was the average of the high and low selling prices of JPMC common stock on January 20, 2005. The SARs become exercisable as follows: 50% 2 years after grant and 50% 3 years after grant.
In addition, on December 14, 2004, the Compensation Committee reviewed the pension benefits of William B. Harrison, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMC. The Compensation Committee approved and the Board ratified an annual pension benefit for Mr. Harrison in the amount of $2,000,000 in the form of a single life annuity commencing at retirement, subject to actuarial reductions for survivor benefits or other forms of payment. This benefit is reduced by the value of all other pension benefits to which Mr. Harrison is otherwise entitled under JPMC's qualified and nonqualified pension plans.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
