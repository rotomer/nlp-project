Item 8.01 Other Events.
In its proxy statement dated April 4, 2005 (Proxy Statement), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC) submitted to its shareholders a proposed 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) that would authorize 300 million shares of Common Stock to be available for issuance as awards (the Authorized Amount) during the period ending May 16, 2010 (the Plan Term), subject to awards that may be made under the Plan that do not count against the Authorized Amount, as detailed in Section 3(b) of the Plan. The Plan would be administered by the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors, which has discretion to specify the terms and conditions of awards.
Subject to shareholder approval of the Plan as contained in the Proxy Statement, it is management's intent to recommend to the Board and the Compensation & Management Development Committee thereof that:
In January 2005, approximately 35.5 million restricted stock units and 2.0 million stock appreciation rights (SARs) (settled only in shares) and stock options were granted under JPMC's shareholder approved plan as part of employee annual incentive compensation. The restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights vest 50% after two years and 50% after three years. The shares of common stock underlying such awards are the equivalent of approximately 1.1% of JPMC's outstanding shares of common stock.
In Note 7 to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, JPMC reported that as of December 31, 2004 the number of restricted stock shares and restricted stock units that were outstanding and unvested was approximately 85.1 million shares. In addition to the above grants, also in January 2005, approximately 26.0 million restricted stock shares and restricted stock units vested or were forfeited. Accordingly, as of January 31, 2005, the number of restricted stock shares and restricted stock units that were outstanding and unvested was approximately 94.6 million shares.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
