This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Section 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
     
In our opinion, the discussion under the heading "United States Federal Taxation" in the Prospectus Supplement and under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Pricing Supplement, subject to the conditions and limitations described therein, sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable generally to holders of the securities offered pursuant to the Pricing Supplement as a result of the ownership and disposition of such securities.

By such consent we do not concede that we are an "Expert" for the purposes of the Act.
