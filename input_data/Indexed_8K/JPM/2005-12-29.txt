Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
In connection with the merger with Bank One and in consideration for waiving change of control protections under a Bank One plan, certain Bank One executive officers who became executive officers of JPMorgan Chase, including Charles W. Scharf, entered into agreements as described in the merger proxy statement that provided for a restricted stock unit grant at the time of the merger, guaranteed levels of compensation through calendar year 2005 and severance protection for three years following the merger, including a payment equal to two times the sum of the executive officer's 2005 guaranteed base salary and cash bonus. Mr. Scharf's agreement has been amended effective as of the date hereof to delete any entitlement to guaranteed compensation for 2005 and to the above described severance payment. Under JPMorgan Chase's current severance policy, Mr. Scharf would be eligible for severance in case of involuntary termination, except for cause, in an amount equal to two times current base salary, plus a further amount determined at the discretion of JPMorgan Chase.
