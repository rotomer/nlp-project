FOURTH      The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is NINE BILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION, of which TWO HUNDRED MILLION shares shall be shares of preferred stock of the par value of $1 per share (hereinafter called "Preferred Stock") and NINE BILLION shares shall be shares of common stock of the par value of $1 per share (hereinafter called "Common Stock").
Any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation which shall increase or decrease the authorized capital stock of the Corporation may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.
The designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the Preferred Stock shall be as follows:
(1) The Board of Directors is expressly authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, with such voting powers, full or limited but not to exceed one vote per share, or without voting powers and with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue thereof adopted by the Board of Directors, and as are not stated and expressed in this Certificate of Incorporation, or any amendment thereto, including (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) the following:
the designation of such series;
the dividend rate of such series, the conditions and dates upon which such dividends shall be payable, the preference or relation which such dividends shall bear to the dividends payable on any other class or classes or on any other series of any class or classes of capital stock, and whether such dividends shall be cumulative or non-cumulative;
whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption by the Corporation, and, if made subject to such redemption, the times, prices and other terms and conditions of such redemption;
the terms and amount of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of the shares of such series;
whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any other class or classes or of any other series of any class or classes of capital stock of the Corporation, and, if provision be made for conversion or exchange, the times, prices, rates, adjustments and other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;
the extent, if any, to which the holders of the shares of such series shall be entitled to vote as a class or otherwise with respect to the election of the directors or otherwise; provided, however, that in no event shall any holder of any series of Preferred Stock be entitled to more than one vote for each share of such Preferred Stock held by him;
the restrictions, if any, on the issue or reissue of any additional Preferred Stock;
the rights of the holders of the shares of such series upon the dissolution of, or upon the distribution of assets of, the Corporation.
(2) Except as otherwise required by law and except for such voting powers with respect to the election of directors or other matters as may be stated in the resolutions of the Board of Directors creating any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of any such series shall have no voting power whatsoever.
FIFTH      The by-laws may be made, altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The books of the Corporation (subject to the provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) may be kept outside of the State of Delaware at such places as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors.
SIXTH      (1)  To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
(2)    The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan) to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, and any such indemnification may continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and may inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(3)    By action of its Board of Directors, notwithstanding any interest of the directors in the action, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, to protect any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against him or incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such (including, without limitation, expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, and whether or not the Corporation would have the power or would be required to indemnify any such person under the terms of any agreement or by-law or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. For purposes of this paragraph (3), "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan.
SEVENTH       (1)    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing.
(2)    Whenever the vote of holders of shares of any class or series other than Common Stock at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate action by any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the meeting and vote of such stockholders may be dispensed with if such action is taken with the written consent of such holders representing not less than a majority of the voting power of all the capital stock of such class or series entitled to be voted upon such action if a meeting were held; provided that in no case shall the written consent be by such holders having less than the minimum percentage of the vote required by statute for such action, and provided that prompt notice is given in writing to all such stockholders entitled to vote thereon of the taking of corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent.
(3)    Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
EIGHTH      The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this certificate to be signed by its authorized officer and caused the corporate seal of the Corporation to be hereunto affixed this 3 day of April 2006.
