(2) Within thirty (30) days following the receipt by JPM of the Final Banking Closing Statement, JPM shall deliver to BNY in writing either (x) its agreement as to the calculation of the Final Banking Payment or (y) its dispute thereof, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of its dispute ("JPM'S OBJECTION"). If JPM shall not have delivered JPM's Objection to BNY within thirty (30) days following the receipt by JPM of the Final Banking Closing Statement, then JPM shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the calculation of the Final Banking Payment set forth in BNY's Final Banking Closing Statement.

(c) The issued share capital of the Transferred Entity is set forth on SCHEDULE 6.1(c). All of the issued and outstanding shares of the Transferred Entity are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by JPM or one of its Subsidiaries as identified on SCHEDULE 6.1(c). Other than the shares of the Transferred Entity to be transferred to BNY at the Closing (the "TRANSFERRED SHARES"), there are no other bonds, debentures, notes or other securities or financial instruments of the Transferred Entity issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are no preemptive rights or outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or other agreements, commitments or understandings concerning the share capital, securities or financial instruments of the Transferred Entity. The Transferred Entity does not own any securities or financial interests in any Person or otherwise owns any asset other than (i) Corporate Trust Agreements, (ii) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Rusday Limited, GT Australia Nominees Limited and Brandwal Limited and shares representing 40% of the outstanding shares of Longreach CP Limited (the "INDIRECT TRANSFERRED ENTITIES") and (iii) any other asset that is a Purchased Corporate Trust Asset.

(f) Promptly upon the execution of this Agreement, JPM and BNY will reasonably coordinate in good faith in respect of any communications by BNY with the parties whose consent is required. BNY and JPM, in consultation with each other, shall as promptly as practicable following the date hereof develop a communications and action plan (which plan shall be designed to communicate promptly and follow up with all such parties with respect to, and to obtain, all such required consents), and shall keep each other reasonably informed regarding the progress and status of such efforts. (g) Each party represents, warrants and agrees that any information furnished by it for inclusion in any regulatory application will to its Knowledge be true and complete in all material respects as of the date so furnished. Section 10.4 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties agree that, from time to time, whether before, on or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) upon request of BNY, JPM will negotiate in good faith with BNY to enter into on or prior to the Closing a transition services agreement on terms mutually agreed between BNY and JPM, pursuant to which, for a period not to expire later than the completion of the Banking Conversion, JPM shall provide certain services required by BNY to support its Private Banking business substantially as such business was supported by the Banking Business prior to the Closing; and (ii) upon request of JPM, BNY will negotiate in good faith with JPM to enter into on or prior to the Closing a networking agreement on a cost neutral basis to BNY and such other terms mutually agreed between BNY and JPM, pursuant to which JPM shall grant certain of BNY's employees with the right to remain at certain of the Banking Branches to provide broker-dealer and other brokerage services in such Banking Branches until the completion of the conversion of BNY's broker-dealer accounts to JPM's broker-dealer platform. Section 10.5 ADVICE OF CHANGES. (a) JPM shall promptly advise BNY of (i) any change or event having a Corporate Trust Material Adverse Effect or a JPM 83

(b) BNY shall promptly advise JPM of (i) any change or event having a BNY Material Adverse Effect or a Banking Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any change or event that would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of BNY's or BNY's representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, (iii) any material negative change in the ordinary course of the business of the Banking Business, (iv) any resignations or terminations of employment of the Banking Business Employees having a title of "Branch Manager" or an official title above "Assistant Vice President" or any Banking Business Employee having a different title but similar duties as those with such a title, and any plans to replace them, and (v) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and to the Knowledge of BNY, any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) or the institution or the threat of significant litigation involving the Banking Business. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's good-faith failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 10.5 shall not provide the other party hereo or any of such other party's Affiliates with a right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the extent that the underlying material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant would independently provide such right. Section 10.6 EXCLUSIVE DEALING. (a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, neither JPM nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action to, directly or indirectly, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person other than BNY or any of its Affiliates and their representatives concerning any sale of the Corporate Trust Business, except to the extent expressly required by this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements or necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. JPM will promptly communicate to BNY the terms of any proposal of inquiry that it or any of its Affiliates may receive in respect of any such transaction other than the transactions contemplated hereby, or of any such negotiations or discussions being sought to be initiated with JPM or any of its Affiliates, 84
and, if known, the identity of the third party initiating any such proposal, inquiry, discussion or negotiation. (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, neither BNY nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action to, directly or indirectly, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person other than the JPM or any of its Affiliates and their representatives concerning any sale of the Banking Business, except to the extent expressly required by this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements or necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. BNY will promptly communicate to JPM the terms of any proposal of inquiry that it or any of its Affiliates may receive in respect of any such transaction other than the transactions contemplated hereby, or of any such negotiations or discussions being sought to be initiated with BNY or any of its Affiliates, and, if known, the identity of the third party initiating any such proposal, inquiry, discussion or negotiation. Section 10.7 CONFIDENTIALITY. The parties agree that the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the fifth anniversary of the date hereof (notwithstanding any earlier termination date in respect of the confidentiality provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, after the Closing, all of the nonpublic information relating to the Purchased Corporate Trust Assets and the Assumed Corporate Trust Liabilities shall be treated as confidential information of BNY for purposes of JPM's obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, and, after the Closing, all of the nonpublic information relating to the Purchased Banking Assets and the Assumed Banking Liabilities shall be treated as confidential information of JPM for purposes of BNY's obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. Section 10.8 PUBLICITY; NOTICES. Until the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall coordinate with each other in advance as to (i) the form and content of any external communication, including any communication intended for dissemination or to reach, or reasonably expected to be disseminated or to reach, members of the public or customers of the Corporate Trust Business or the Banking Business regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the form and content of any communication from JPM to the employees of BNY or from BNY to the employees of JPM. Neither party shall disseminate any such communication without the prior approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the parties hereto from making any and all public disclosures legally required to comply with any applicable securities laws or regulations or requests of governmental agencies or authorities; PROVIDED that, to the extent possible under the circumstances, the party making such disclosure consults with the other party, and considers in good faith the views of the other party, before doing so. 85
Section 10.9 TRANSFER OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS. (a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment, assumption or transfer of any Purchased Corporate Trust Asset, Purchased Banking Asset, Assumed Corporate Trust Liability or Assumed Banking Liability if such assignment, assumption or transfer, without a necessary consent, waiver or approval of a third party (including any Governmental Authority), would be ineffective or would constitute a default under, or other contravention of, the provisions of any Contract or Applicable Law or give rise to any right of acceleration of any obligation thereunder or any right to termination thereof, and such consent or approval shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing Date (any such asset or liability, a "RESTRICTED ITEM"). In addition to being a Restricted Item, any Appointment that fails to be transferred from JPM to BNY at the Closing shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Servicing Agreement, and, to the extent the terms of the Servicing Agreement conflicts with the terms of this Section 10.9 with respect to such Appointment, the terms of the Servicing Agreement shall govern. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each of JPM and BNY shall prepare and deliver to the other a list of those Contracts or other assets or liabilities, if any, determined to be Restricted Items as of such date with respect to the Corporate Trust Sale or the Banking Sale, respectively. (b) With respect to any Restricted Item, on the Closing Date, BNY and JPM shall, if and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law or the applicable Contract, and subject to the provisions of the Related Agreements, if applicable, assume the responsibility, as agent of JPM or BNY, as applicable, to supervise, manage, administer and otherwise discharge the duties of JPM or BNY, as applicable, with respect to such Restricted Item until the requisite consents and approvals are obtained (or any relevant Contract is amended to provide) for BNY or JPM, as applicable, to assume JPM or BNY's rights, privileges and powers thereunder. Upon the receipt of such consent or approval (or the amendment of such Contracts), BNY or JPM, as applicable, will assume JPM's or BNY's rights, privileges and powers thereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and such Restricted Item shall constitute a transferred Purchased Corporate Trust Asset or Purchased Banking Asset, as applicable, or a transferred Assumed Corporate Trust Liability or Assumed Banking Liability, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement. As compensation for acting as agent of JPM or BNY, as the case may be, with respect to any Restricted Item pursuant to this Section 10.9, BNY or JPM, as applicable, shall be entitled to all fees, and all other revenues of JPM or BNY, respectively, in respect thereof. (c) The parties shall cooperate, and each party shall use its respective reasonable best efforts, to maintain good relations with any obligees or other counterparties in connection with any Restricted Item with respect to which it or its Subsidiaries acts as the other party's agent under this Section 10.9 and shall not (i) sell, sublease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any rights related to such Restricted Item or (ii) solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to any acquisition or purchase of any rights related to such Restricted Item or authorize any of their officers, directors, agents or 86
affiliates to solicit or encourage, or fail to notify the other promptly following its receipt of any such inquiry or proposal. (d) Subject to the provisions of the Related Agreements, after the Close of Business on the Closing Date, (i) a party acting as agent for the other party hereto under Section 10.9(b) shall, promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, give such other party notice of any default or event of default under or with respect to any Restricted Item; and (ii) in so acting, with respect to any Restricted Item as to which notice has been given in accordance with the preceding sentence, the party acting as agent with respect to such Restricted Item pursuant to Section 10.9(b), while any default is continuing, will continue to act only pursuant to written instructions from the other party hereto; PROVIDED that such party acting as agent shall not have any liability for any act taken or omission made in accordance with such instructions or as a result of the failure by the other party hereto to give such instructions in a timely manner. (e) Each party shall furnish to the other party and the other party's authorized agents and representatives such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the Restricted Items with respect to which such first party then acts as agent for the other party pursuant to this Section 10.9 as such other party shall reasonably request. (f) A party acting as agent for the other party hereto under Section 10.9(b) shall take all actions reasonably requested by such other party to enforce such other party's rights under any Restricted Item, including, without limitation, the assertion of any claim against a party to such Restricted Item or the assignment of any such claim to such other party. (g) The parties shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts after the Closing Date to obtain any approvals or consent required to transfer each Restricted Item. (h) Without limitation on the foregoing, in the case of any Restricted Item that is not transferred to BNY or JPM, as applicable, as of the Closing Date, JPM and BNY shall use reasonable best efforts so that BNY or JPM, as applicable, obtains the benefits and burdens of each such Restricted Item that would have been obtained by it had such Restricted Item been transferred to JPM or BNY, as the case may be, as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither JPM nor BNY shall have any obligation to insure the performance of any party to any Restricted Item or the value thereof. In the event that Applicable Law in a jurisdiction shall prohibit the parties from transferring the benefits and burdens of any Restricted Item pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 10.9, the parties agree to cooperate with each other and to use reasonable best efforts to promptly determine and effect a practicable alternative means that would have substantially the same economic effect. (i) The provisions of this Section 10.9 shall survive the Closing and terminate on the second anniversary, or the fourth anniversary with respect to the Corporate Trust Agreements, of the Closing. 87
Section 10.10 EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF RELATED AGREEMENTS. On the Closing Date, BNY and JPM shall execute and deliver the Servicing Agreement. Section 10.11 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENTS RELATING TO CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS. (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "CORPORATE TRUST NON-COMPETITION PERIOD"), neither JPM nor any of its Affiliates (collectively, the "JPM ENTITIES") shall, directly or indirectly, engage in the Corporate Trust Business, as conducted on the Closing Date, except for those businesses of any of the JPM Entities as of the Closing Date that are not included in the Purchased Corporate Trust Assets (the "COMPETING CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any JPM Entity may do each of the following without JPM or any Affiliate of JPM being deemed to be in violation of this Section 10.11(a): (1) own or hold up to 10% of the outstanding securities of any entity whose securities are listed and traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange or market (PROVIDED that no JPM Entity otherwise controls the business or affairs of such entity) or hold or exercise rights of ownership with respect to any security in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise for the benefit of a third party not affiliated with JPM; (2) make acquisitions or maintain ownership of any entity in connection with the venture capital or merchant banking line of business of JPM or any Affiliate thereof; (3) merge, consolidate or otherwise engage in a business combination with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets or businesses to, any Person that is not an Affiliate of JPM with an existing Competing Corporate Trust Business and continue to operate such existing Competing Corporate Trust Business; PROVIDED that members of the JPM board of directors do not constitute a majority of the board of directors of the surviving corporation of such transaction (or of the board of directors of its publicly traded parent company) and that the JPM shareholders immediately prior to consummation of such transaction do not immediately after consummation of such transaction own 55% or more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of the surviving entity of such transaction (or of its publicly traded parent company); and, upon the consummation of such a permitted transaction, the Corporate Trust Non-Competition Period and the Banking Non-Competition Period and the prohibitions of Sections 10.11(a) and 10.12(a) shall immediately terminate and be of no further effect; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, after the consummation of such merger, consolidation, acquisition or sale, no JPM Entity (including the surviving corporation of such transaction) shall use the "JPM" name or any derivation thereof with respect to the Competing Corporate Trust Business until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and (4) purchase or acquire (through merger, stock purchase or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or otherwise) any entity with an existing 88
Competing Corporate Trust Business and continue to operate such existing Competing Corporate Trust Business; PROVIDED that, after the consummation of such purchase or acquisition, such Competing Corporate Trust Business shall not use the "JPM" name or any derivation thereof until the expiration of the Corporate Trust Non-Competition Period; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (i) if the consolidated revenue of such Competing Corporate Trust Business for the twelve-(12)-month period ending on the date of the consummation of such purchase or acquisition is greater than the amount set forth on SCHEDULE 10.11(a)(4)(i) (using 2006 as the base year and increasing this amount by 5% per calendar year beginning in 2007) (such amount, the "CORPORATE TRUST REVENUE THRESHOLD"), then such JPM Entity shall commence as promptly as practicable a process to sell such Competing Corporate Trust Business to an unaffiliated third party (which sale shall occur no later than twenty-four (24) months after the consummation of such purchase or acquisition); and (ii) if the aggregate consolidated revenue of JPM's Competing Corporate Trust Businesses (other than any Competing Corporate Trust Business that JPM is required to sell or has sold pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 10.11(a)(4)) for the twelve-(12)-month period (the "CORPORATE TRUST TEST PERIOD") ending on the date of the consummation of JPM's most recent acquisition of a Competing Corporate Trust Business (other than an acquisition of a Competing Corporate Trust Business that JPM is required to sell or has sold pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 10.11(a)(4)) is greater than the amount set forth on SCHEDULE 10.11(a)(4)(ii) (using 2006 as the base year and increasing this amount by 5% per calendar year beginning in 2007), then such JPM Entity shall commence as promptly as practicable a process to sell all or a portion of such Competing Corporate Trust Businesses to an unaffiliated third party (which sale shall occur no later than twenty-four (24) months after the consummation of such purchase or acquisition) such that the aggregate consolidated revenue of JPM's Competing Corporate Trust Businesses not being sold pursuant to this clause (ii) for the Corporate Trust Test Period is the Corporate Trust Revenue Threshold or less; and in each of cases (i) and (ii), JPM and BNY agree as to the matters set forth on SCHEDULE 10.11(a)(4)(iii). (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, no JPM Entity shall directly or indirectly solicit for 89
employment or hire any Transferred Corporate Trust Employee; PROVIDED that this Section 10.11(b) shall not prohibit any JPM Entity from (i) conducting a solicitation made by means of a general purpose advertisement not specifically targeted at BNY or the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees or hiring any Transferred Corporate Trust Employee as a result of such general purpose advertisement or (ii) rehiring any Transferred Corporate Trust Employee who was terminated by BNY or its Affiliates after the Closing Date. (c) JPM understands and acknowledges that (i) it would be difficult to calculate damages to BNY from any breach of the obligations of JPM under this Section 10.11, (ii) injury to BNY from any such breach would be irreparable and impossible to measure and (iii) the remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of this Section 10.11 would therefore be an inadequate remedy and, accordingly, BNY shall, in addition to all other available remedies (including, without limitation, seeking such damages as it can show it has sustained by reason of such breach and/or the exercise of all other rights it has under this Agreement), be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies without the necessity of showing actual damages or posting bond. (d) JPM understands and acknowledges that that this Section 10.11 imposes an affirmative duty on it to ensure that its Affiliates comply with its terms, and that JPM will be held accountable for any noncompliance. The parties understand and acknowledge that occasional, inadvertent DE MINIMIS violations of this Section 10.11 by their Affiliates shall not be deemed a violation of this Section 10.11. (e) JPM and BNY understand and acknowledge that that the restrictive covenants and other agreements contained in this Section 10.11 are an essential part of this Agreement and the Corporate Trust Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. It is the intention of the parties that, if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein are held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by Applicable Law, or is in way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent that such provision would then be valid or enforceable under Applicable Law, such provision shall be construed and interpreted or reformed to provide for a restriction or covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions as shall be valid and enforceable under Applicable Law. Section 10.12 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENTS RELATING TO BANKING AND OTHER BUSINESSES. (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "BANKING NON-COMPETITION PERIOD"), neither BNY nor any of its Affiliates (collectively, the "BNY ENTITIES") shall, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in the business described in clause (i) of the definition of "Banking Business" (provided that this clause (i) shall not prohibit the BNY Entities from providing Private Banking or Banking-Related Services to clients who each have investible assets of at least $1,000,000 or an annual income of at least $400,000, in the case of a client whose principal residence is in Connecticut, New Jersey or New 90

Subject to the provisions of the Banking Transition Support Agreement, any amounts required by any Governmental Authority to be withheld from any of the accounts included within the Assumed Banking Deposits (the "BANKING WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS") or any penalties imposed by any Governmental Authority will be handled as follows: (a) any Banking Withholding Obligations required to be withheld on or prior to the Closing Date will be withheld and remitted by BNY to the appropriate Governmental Authority on or prior to the time they are due; and (b) any Banking Withholding Obligations required to be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority after the Closing Date with respect to Banking Withholding Obligations after the Closing Date and not withheld by BNY shall be withheld and remitted by JPM. Any penalties that relate to information returns filed by BNY on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with transactions that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date will be BNY's responsibility. JPM shall cooperate with BNY in providing copies of penalty notices on a timely basis and other information which BNY may reasonably request in order to verify or challenge such penalties. To the extent that any penalty imposed by the IRS relates to information returns filed by JPM (or filed by BNY on behalf of JPM) after the Closing Date in connection with transactions that occurred prior to the Closing Date, JPM shall be responsible for such penalty; PROVIDED that BNY has satisfied its obligation to provide all material information to JPM which is necessary to complete such information returns (including any such obligation set forth in the Banking Transition Support Agreement). Section 12.8 LETTERS OF CREDIT. In the event that any Assumed Letter of Credit cannot be assigned to JPM, on the Closing Date, JPM and BNY shall enter into a participation agreement in customary form reasonably satisfactory to JPM and BNY pursuant to which JPM shall acquire and assume all of BNY's rights and obligations under such Assumed Letters of Credit. The participation agreements referred to in this Section 12.8 shall be referred to herein as the "PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS." Section 12.9 FORM OF TRANSFER. BNY and JPM may by mutual written agreement at any time change the method of transferring the Banking Business from BNY to JPM in order to achieve, in a more efficient manner, the business, financial accounting, 108
regulatory and tax objectives of BNY and JPM in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such change shall alter or change the amount of consideration to be paid by JPM as provided in this Agreement. Section 12.10 DATA PROCESSING CONVERSION FOR THE RETAIL BRANCHES AND HANDLING OF CERTAIN ITEMS. (a) The parties hereto agree to cooperate to employ their commercially reasonable efforts to plan, execute and complete the Banking Conversion in an orderly and efficient manner pursuant to the Banking Conversion Plan. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, JPM and BNY shall each appoint qualified staff members to act as project managers for the Banking Conversion (each, a "BANKING CONVERSION PROJECT MANAGER"). Such Banking Conversion Project Managers shall act as the principal contacts between the parties on matters relating to the Banking Conversion, and shall coordinate the assignment of personnel as required and generally facilitate the planning, execution and completion of the Banking Conversion pursuant to the Banking Conversion Plan. In addition to any conversion of the data and systems files as part of the Banking Conversion pursuant to the Banking Conversion Plan and subject to the Banking Transition Support Agreement, the parties shall reasonably cooperate in performing such tasks as may be outlined in the Banking Conversion Plan, including the collection and input of relevant data, development of new operating procedures and design of forms, in each case, as mutually agreed by the parties. (b) Except as otherwise set forth in the Banking Transition Support Agreement, each party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the Banking Conversion, including costs and expenses (including the costs and expenses of such party's employees) incurred in converting, moving, storing, archiving, adapting or otherwise transferring or facilitating the transfer of any data, information, Securities, records, files and systems from the systems and facilities of BNY and its Affiliates to the systems and facilities of JPM and its Affiliates (including costs with respect to computer programs, data processing, deconversion, data extraction, third-party charges and filing fees); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.10 or otherwise in this Agreement, JPM shall not be liable hereunder for any termination fees, penalties or other break costs incurred by BNY or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Banking Conversion. (c) In connection with the conversion activities described in subsections (a) and (b) immediately above, and subject to Applicable Law, it is further agreed that: (1) JPM will review, subject to Section 10.1, current operations of BNY, and BNY and JPM shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to develop a mutually agreeable written plan within 30 days of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time, the "BANKING CONVERSION PLAN"), which Banking Conversion Plan shall (i) set forth the plan, procedures and schedule required to fully effect the Banking Conversion as promptly as practicable after the Closing, (ii) shall include interim target dates for the completion of integral items to the Banking Conversion; and (iii) shall provide that conversion items integral to the operation of the Banking Business, as 109
identified by JPM, shall have the earliest target completion dates in the Banking Conversion Plan; (2) BNY will, in accordance with JPM's reasonable instructions, change, alter or update customer facing systems (including Internet, ATMs, IVRs, Print Output and Teller Receipts) so that, after the Closing, they will reflect JPM as the owner of the Banking Business; (3) as of the Closing Date, BNY will provide JPM with BNY's existing customer, account and transaction data feeds in order to allow JPM to comply with applicable legal and contractual AML and privacy requirements on and after the Closing Date; (4) BNY will use reasonable best efforts to create prior to the Closing a unique and segmented general ledger that will be substantially sufficient for JPM to balance, reconcile and settle its books and records in accordance with Applicable Law and GAAP; (5) BNY will ensure that, as of the Closing, all data related to Assigned Banking Loans and other Purchased Banking Assets residing on BNY's commercial loan systems, including, but not limited to, the AFS, AIMS, ECAPS, PIMS and CIF systems will be logically segregated from data relating to the Excluded Banking Assets so that, with respect to such systems from and after the Closing: (i) JPM employees will have view and inquiry access to Assigned Banking Loans and other Purchased Banking Assets data and (ii) BNY employees, other than employees assigned to the Regional Loan Operations or Client Management Administration units (which employees JPM acknowledges will have view, inquiry and operational access to such data pursuant to the Banking Transition Support Agreement), will be restricted from having access to the Assigned Banking Loans and other Purchased Banking Assets data on the systems; (6) BNY will use reasonable best efforts to separate data relevant to the Purchased Banking Assets from other data of BNY prior to the Closing; and (7) prior to the Closing, BNY shall have completed in all material respects (including time of delivery and service level requirements) the data conversion, mapping and other systems functionality projects to be specified in the Banking Conversion Plan. Section 12.11 PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OWNED BANKING PREMISES. In the event of any physical damage or destruction, other than ordinary wear and tear, to any Owned Banking Premises, at the election of JPM, either (a) BNY shall prior to the Closing Date repair such damage or destruction to return such property to its condition prior to such damage or destruction, (b) the Net Book Value of such Owned Banking Premises shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by JPM and BNY or (c) BNY shall pay to JPM an amount equal to the sum of (1) the insurance proceeds received by BNY with respect to such damage or destruction, (2) any applicable deductible amount and (3) such additional 110
amount as may be required to repair such damage or destruction to return such property to its condition prior to such damage or destruction. Section 12.12 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER FOR EXCLUDED BANKING PREMISES. (a) OWNED PROPERTIES. Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, if BNY or any of its Affiliates desires to sell, transfer, convey or exchange, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any real property that it owns that is part of the Excluded Banking Premises (other than any Excluded Banking Premise set forth on SCHEDULE 12.12(a)), to a Person other than an Affiliate of BNY (except pursuant to an indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange of one or more Excluded Banking Premises that may be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a merger, business combination, share purchase or similar transaction involving BNY or any of its "significant subsidiaries," as defined under Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or a sale-leaseback or similar transaction), then prior to effecting or making such sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange or entering into an agreement with respect thereto, BNY shall notify JPM in writing of the material terms and conditions upon which it proposes to effect such sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange (such notice, the "TRANSFER NOTICE"), which Transfer Notice shall include all material terms and conditions of the proposed sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange relating to price, terms of payment and timing of closing. JPM shall have the right to acquire the real property that is the subject of the Transfer Notice on the same terms and conditions as are set forth in the Transfer Notice. JPM shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of the Transfer Notice during which to notify BNY whether or not JPM desires to exercise its right of first offer, and, during such thirty (30) day period, BNY shall promptly provide to JPM title reports, surveys, environmental reports and other due diligence materials as may be in BNY's possession, and BNY shall provide JPM with reasonable access to the applicable premises for the purposes of conducting due diligence investigations. If JPM does not respond during the applicable period set forth above for exercising its purchasing right under this Section 12.12, JPM shall be deemed to have declined to exercise its right of first offer under this Section 12.12 with respect to such real property. If JPM elects to purchase the real property that is the subject of the Transfer Notice, the parties shall act promptly and in good faith to enter into a purchase agreement reflecting the terms and conditions set forth in the Transfer Notice and other customary terms and conditions. BNY and JPM agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any applicable conditions precedent in such purchase agreement to be satisfied as expeditiously as possible. At the closing of the sale of such real property, (a) BNY shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver to JPM (i) a bargain and sale deed (without covenant against grantor's acts) transferring the real property described in the Transfer Notice to JPM, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to JPM and BNY; (ii) customary title affidavits; and (iii) any other instruments reasonably requested by JPM to give effect to the purchase; and (b) JPM shall deliver to BNY the purchase price specified in the Transfer Notice in immediately available funds or other consideration as specified in the Transfer Notice. If JPM does not elect to purchase the property pursuant to this Section 12.12 or, having elected to so purchase such property, fails to do so within the time period required by this Section 12.12, BNY shall have the 111
right, for a period of 180 days after the expiration of the offer period referred to above or the date of such failure, as applicable, to enter into a definitive written agreement and consummate the sale, transfer or exchange with an unaffiliated Person regarding the sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange of the real property described in the Transfer Notice on terms and conditions that satisfy the following criteria: (1) the amount of consideration to be paid by the purchasing party may not be less than the consideration set forth in the Transfer Notice (excluding customary pro-rations, transfer taxes, closing costs and brokerage commissions); (2) subject to clause (1) above, the form of consideration may not be materially different from that set forth in the Transfer Notice, except to the extent any change in the form of consideration makes the terms of the transaction less favorable from the purchaser's standpoint; and (3) the terms and conditions set forth in such definitive written agreement, when considered together with the form and amount of consideration to be paid by such purchasing party, may not render the terms of such transaction, taken as a whole, materially inferior (to BNY or its Subsidiaries from an economic standpoint) to those set forth in the Transfer Notice. If such sale, transfer, conveyance or exchange is not consummated within the 180-day period described above and in accordance with the terms of such definitive written agreement, the requirements of this Section 12.12 shall apply anew to any further efforts by BNY or any of its Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, convey or exchange the real property described in the Transfer Notice. (b) LEASED PROPERTIES. If BNY or any of its Affiliates is party to a lease with respect to any real property that is part of the Excluded Banking Premises (which lease contains at least one unexercised renewal option), and BNY or its applicable Affiliate does not desire to renew such lease, then at least sixty (60) days prior to the last date on which such lease may be renewed, and prior to providing any written notice to the landlord under such lease that BNY or its Affiliates does not intend to renew such lease, BNY shall notify JPM in writing of its intent (the "NON-RENEWAL NOTICE"), and shall provide JPM with a written copy of the lease all amendments and modifications thereto and all material correspondence files, together with all other documents relating to the lease as JPM may reasonably request. Within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Non-Renewal Notice, JPM may notify BNY that it desires to occupy such leased premises. If JPM provides such notice to BNY, then BNY or its applicable Affiliate shall renew such lease in a timely manner and, as of the commencement date of the renewal term, BNY shall sublet the space covered by such lease on the same economic terms and for the same duration as BNY or its applicable Affiliate is leasing such space from the landlord; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if such sublet would require consent of the landlord, then, then BNY or its applicable Affiliate shall be required to renew the lease and sublet the space to JPM only if it receives such consent of the landlord; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, in such case, BNY and its applicable 112
Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent and to permit JPM to participate in any discussions with the landlord to obtain such consent. (c) The provisions of this Section 12.12 shall survive the Closing and terminate on the fifth anniversary of the Closing. Section 12.13 TERMINATION OF AGENT BANK AGREEMENT. BNY and JPM agree that, on or prior to the Closing, BNY and JPM shall terminate, or shall cause the termination of, effective as of or prior to the Closing, the Agent Bank Agreement, dated as of October 21, 1997, as amended (the "AGENT BANK AGREEMENT"), among The Bank of New York Company, Inc., certain of its affiliates and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association, without the requirement of any payment by JPM, BNY or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any costs, fees or other penalties or break costs. BNY and JPM agree that, upon such termination, all rights of BNY to purchase or arrange to purchase (whether pursuant to Section 11.3 of the Agent Bank Agreement or otherwise) the Accounts, the BNY Co. Relationship Accounts and/or the Program Receivables shall terminate and be without any force or effect. As used in this Section 12.13, "Accounts," the "BNY Co. Relationship Accounts" and the "Program Receivables" shall have the respective meanings attributed to them in the Agent Bank Agreement. Section 12.14 LIMITED LICENSE OF BNY'S NAME. (a) On the Closing Date, BNY shall grant JPM a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the "BNY" name in the forms that currently appear in branch facilities and trade names associated therewith on any branch that constitutes an Owned Banking Premise or that is the subject of a Banking Lease in each case in substantially the same manner as used by BNY immediately prior to the Closing, except that JPM shall not have any right to use in any manner BNY's multi-color "BNY" logo design, a copy of which is set forth on SCHEDULE 12.14 (the "BNY NAME LICENSE"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, BNY agrees that, if the BNY's multi-color "BNY" logo design or the name "Putnam Trust" appears on any signage on any Owned Banking Premise, any branch that is subject of a Banking Lease or any Other Banking Facility, BNY shall either (i) grant JPM a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use such logo design or name, as applicable, in the forms that currently appear on such premise, branch or facility for the duration of the BNY Name License; or (ii) remove such logo design or name without any cost to JPM and without any damage to such premise, branch or facility. In addition to the foregoing, if the name "Putnam Trust" is etched into any building on any Owned Banking Premise, any branch that is subject of a Banking Lease or any Other Banking Facility, then BNY agrees that it shall grant JPM a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use such name to the extent necessary to permit such name to remain etched into such building. The term of the BNY Name License shall commence on the Closing Date and expire upon the Banking Conversion. (b) No fee for the BNY Name License shall be charged until the later of (i) July 1, 2007 and (ii) nine months following the Closing Date (the later of such two 113
dates, the "BANKING LICENSE FEE START DATE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if either (1) the Banking Conversion Plan provides for a scheduled completion of the Banking Conversion after April 30, 2007 (the number of days between the scheduled completion and April 30, 2007, the "BANKING CONVERSION PLAN DELAY PERIOD") and/or (2) BNY's completion of a material item set forth in the Banking Conversion Plan is delayed beyond the scheduled deadline for completing such item in the Banking Conversion Plan (the number of days between the date on which BNY completes such item and the scheduled deadline for such item, the "BANKING MILESTONE DELAY PERIOD"), then the Banking License Fee Start Date shall be postponed by a number of days equal to the sum of the Banking Conversion Plan Delay Period, if any, and the aggregate Banking Milestone Delay Periods for all such items, if any. Beginning on the Banking License Fee Start Date, for each month during which the BNY Name License shall continue to be in effect, JPM shall pay BNY the following monthly fees: (i) for the period commencing on the Banking License Fee Start Date and ending on the date that is four months after the Banking License Fee Start Date, Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per month; and (ii) for each month thereafter, Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). No fee shall be charged for the limited, perpetual license contemplated by the penultimate sentence of Section 12.14(a). Section 12.15 BANK-AT-WORK ARRANGEMENT; SUBLEASE OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BRANCHES. (a) During the Banking Non-Competition Period, BNY shall not enter into any "bank-at-work" arrangement with any Person other than JPM or its Affiliates. (b) JPM and BNY shall enter into a "group banking" agreement, to be effective as of the Closing, containing terms and condition no worse in the aggregate than any comparable "group banking" agreement that JPM or its Subsidiaries has with a third party as of the date hereof. (c) In connection with the agreement described in Section 12.15(b), JPM and its applicable Subsidiary shall have the the option to sublease from BNY or its applicable Subsidiary the Banking Premises set forth on SCHEDULE 12.15(C). If JPM exercises this option, JPM and BNY agree to negotiate in good faith to enter into a sublease agreement on terms mutually acceptable between BNY and JPM. Section 12.16 INFORMATION REGARDING BANKING CUSTOMERS AND RELATIONSHIPS. Without limiting Section 3.1(a)(8), after the Closing, neither BNY nor any of its Affiliates shall provide or furnish to BNY Mortgage Company LLC any books, records or other data (including files, customer lists, mailing lists, documentation or records) acquired by JPM pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(8), including relating to any customer for which a relationship was transferred from BNY or any of its Subsidiaries to JPM or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Banking Sale. Section 12.17 PRIVATE BANKING EARNOUT. The Parties agree that, based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1.4 of Schedule A, JPM shall pay to BNY an amount not less than $25 million nor greater than $75 million based on individuals who are clients of BNY's private banking business as of the Closing who 114
establish new deposit accounts at JPM bank branches in Connecticut, New Jersey or New York during the one-year period ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date. ARTICLE XIII EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFIT MATTERS Section 13.1 CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS. (a) OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT/ AUTOMATIC TRANSFER OF EMPLOYMENT. Commencing on the date hereof and ending ninety (90) calendar days hereafter, JPM shall provide BNY with reasonable access to each of the Corporate Trust Business Employees. On or prior to the end of such ninety-(90)-day period, BNY shall provide JPM with a list of those Corporate Trust Business Employees to whom BNY (i) will make a Comparable Job Offer for employment with BNY, with respect to those employed in the United States and any other jurisdiction where transfer does not occur by operation of Applicable Law (the "SELECTED NON-AUTOMATIC TRANSFER EMPLOYEES") or (ii) would have made a Comparable Job Offer for employment with BNY but which job offer is unnecessary due to the fact that the employment of such Corporate Trust Business Employees will automatically transfer to BNY under Applicable Law (the "SELECTED AUTOMATIC TRANSFER EMPLOYEES", and collectively with the Selected Non-Automatic Transfer Employees, the "SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS EMPLOYEES"). Subject to Applicable Law, at least thirty (30) days (unless an earlier date is required by Applicable Law) prior to the Closing Date and effective as of the Closing Date, BNY shall (i) make, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be accepted, a Comparable Job Offer to all Selected Non-Automatic Corporate Trust Business Employees and (ii) take all action necessary under Applicable Law to effectuate the transfer of the (A) Selected Automatic Transfer Employees and (B) the Corporate Trust Business Employees who will automatically transfer to BNY under Applicable Law but who are not on the list of Selected Automatic Transfer Employees (the "NON-SELECTED AUTOMATIC TRANSFER EMPLOYEES") (unless otherwise requested by JPM with respect to a particular Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employee). A Comparable Job Offer may be conditioned upon (i) completing a standard and customary written employment application with BNY and (ii) satisfying pre-employment screening requirements, except that drug testing, fingerprinting and a criminal background check shall be considered satisfied to the extent JPM reaffirms to BNY the representation made in the last sentence of Section 6.12(a) (the "BNY JOB OFFER CONDITION"). The Selected Corporate Trust Business Employees (and any other Corporate Trust Business Employees, including the Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employees) who, as applicable, either (i) accept BNY's offer of employment and satisfy the BNY Job Offer Condition or (ii) otherwise become employees of BNY by operation of Applicable Law are referred to herein as the "TRANSFERRED CORPORATE TRUST EMPLOYEES." BNY's employment of the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees shall be deemed to commence at 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, without regard to whether the Transferred Corporate Trust Employee is actively at work on the Closing Date in the case of an employee who on the Closing Date is absent from work due to a vacation, jury duty, funeral leave or personal day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a Corporate Trust Business Employee who has accepted BNY's job offer is not available to 115
perform services on the Closing Date because on the Closing Date such employee is on sick leave, short or long-term disability, military leave, leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act or other leave of absence approved by JPM (other than a vacation, jury duty, funeral leave or personal day), he or she shall remain an employee of JPM (except as may otherwise be provided by Applicable Law); PROVIDED that, BNY shall hire such Corporate Trust Business Employee if such Employee returns to work no later than the date that is the earlier of the scheduled return date (including any approved extensions thereto) and six months from the date of commencement of such leave, and, for purposes of this Agreement, such Employee shall become a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee as of the date active employment with BNY commences and, to the extent applicable, references in this Section 13.1 to the "Closing Date" shall relate to the date active employment commences. Those Corporate Trust Business Employees who do not receive, or do not accept, a Comparable Job Offer from BNY, and those Corporate Trust Business Employees whose employment does not transfer to BNY by operation of Applicable Law, shall not be considered Transferred Corporate Trust Employees for any purpose of this Agreement. The parties shall comply with their respective legal obligations relating to informing and consulting with any Corporate Trust Business Employees whose employment automatically transfers to BNY under Applicable Law and/or their recognized representatives (including without limitation any works council or trades union who is entitled to be informed and consulted in respect of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement) and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the breaching party shall indemnify and hold the non-breaching party harmless on a dollar-for-dollar basis in respect of any Damages (including any Tax) incurred as a result of the breaching party's failure to comply with these obligations. (b) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH JPM. Subject to Applicable Law, as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees shall cease active participation in each Corporate Trust Employee Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 13.1 or as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, JPM shall retain all assets and liabilities for the Corporate Trust Business Employees under the Corporate Trust Employee Plans. Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, JPM shall be liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the Corporate Trust Employee Plans that are welfare plans that are incurred by the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment, business travel accident insurance, short-term disability and workers compensation benefits, upon the event giving rise to such benefits; (ii) health, vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits, on the date such services, materials or supplies were provided; and (iii) long-term disability benefits, on the eligibility date determined by the long-term disability carrier for the plan in which the individual participates. (c) BENEFITS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING DATE. Subject to Applicable Law, effective as of the Closing Date, BNY shall provide the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees with the same employee benefit plans and programs as those that are provided to similarly situated employees of BNY (both by job classification or status and by 116
geographic location). For purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate in and vesting under any employee benefit plan of BNY or its Affiliates, (ii) the banking privileges and perquisites applicable to the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees and (iii) retirement eligibility under any BNY plan providing for the grant of equity awards , and for benefit accrual purposes only for vacation, sickness benefits and severance benefits (if any), each Transferred Corporate Trust Employee shall be credited with the years of service he or she has been credited with under the comparable Corporate Trust Employee Plan; PROVIDED that such service shall not be recognized for purposes of (i) grandfathering, benefit accruals and/or level of pay credits under any BNY defined benefit retirement plan or (ii) retiree medical benefits. BNY shall (i) waive any preexisting conditions and waiting periods under the welfare benefit plans of BNY that provide healthcare benefits in which the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees are eligible to participate to the same extent that such conditions and waiting periods were waived under the comparable Corporate Trust Employee Plan, and (ii) subject to JPM providing BNY with the applicable information with respect to each Transferred Corporate Trust Employee in a form that BNY determines is administratively feasible to take into account under its plans, cause such plans (other than HMOs) to honor any expenses incurred by such Corporate Trust Employees and their eligible dependents under Corporate Trust Employee Plans that are healthcare benefit plans during the portion of the calendar year in which they become employees of BNY for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance, maximum out-of-pocket, and similar expenses, to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable Corporate Trust Employee Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Transferred Corporate Trust Employees providing services outside of the United States, to the extent more favorable or otherwise required by Applicable Law, the provision of benefits following the Closing Date and credited service shall be in accordance with Applicable Law and in all other respects their employment relationship shall take effect on and from the Closing Date as if it were originally made between each such employee and BNY. (d) COBRA. JPM shall be responsible for the administration of and shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities for continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") with respect to Transferred Corporate Trust Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries for "qualifying events" occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and BNY shall be responsible for all obligations and liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage for Transferred Corporate Trust Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries with respect to "qualifying events" occurring after the Closing Date. JPM shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage for all Corporate Trust Business Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries who are not Transferred Corporate Trust Employees. (e) SEVERANCE. (i) TERMINATION OF TRANSFERRED CORPORATE TRUST EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING THE CLOSING DATE. BNY shall pay severance and provide benefits in accordance with the severance schedule set forth on SCHEDULE 13.1(e)(i) (or such other applicable plan, policy or arrangement to the extent required by Applicable Law), to each Transferred Corporate Trust Employee who was a Selected Corporate Trust Business 117
Employee and whose employment is terminated by BNY without "cause" (as defined under BNY's policies and practices) within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, subject to the execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of BNY, JPM and their respective Affiliates. (ii) TERMINATION OF CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT BECOME TRANSFERRED CORPORATE TRUST EMPLOYEES OR WHO WERE NON-SELECTED AUTOMATIC TRANSFER EMPLOYEES. With respect to Corporate Trust Business Employees who do not become Transferred Corporate Trust Employees for any reason (other than due to having rejected a Comparable Job Offer), whether due to the fact that such Employees were not Selected Corporate Trust Employees or due to the fact that they do not transfer (including, with respect to persons employed outside of the United States, due to refusal to transfer to BNY) under Applicable Law, JPM shall retain and shall satisfy all severance, notice (including pay in lieu of notice), unfair dismissal and redundancy pay and benefits, including any such obligations that are statutorily imposed and the employer-paid portion of any taxes or social contributions (the "SEVERANCE BENEFITS"). BNY shall assume and shall satisfy all Severance Benefits with respect to Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employees who become Transferred Corporate Trust Employees; PROVIDED that JPM shall reimburse BNY, on an as incurred basis, for the full cost of the Severance Benefits paid to a Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employee who was previously listed as a Corporate Trust Business Employee, becomes a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee and receives notice (to be effective immediately) of termination of employment from BNY within five (5) Business Days of the Closing Date and whose employment termination is otherwise effectuated in accordance with the procedures set forth in the last sentence of this Section 13.1(e)(ii). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, BNY shall reimburse JPM, on an as incurred basis, for the full cost of the Severance Benefits paid to the JPM employees who are categorized as Trust Financial Management employees (the "TFM EMPLOYEES"), upon the termination of such employees during the term of the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement or in connection with the expiration of the term of the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the end of the relevant Service Period (as defined in the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement)); PROVIDED that the severance of the TFM Employees shall be determined in accordance with SCHEDULE 13.1(e)(i) (with benefits to be provided under the terms of the JPM Severance Pay Plan), with the base salary or rate of pay used for purposes of such severance calculation to be the last base salary or rate of pay that was included in determining the Service Fee payable by BNY to JPM for such TFM Employee under the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement. Except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law, neither BNY, JPM nor any of their respective Affiliates shall pay or provide Severance Benefits to any Corporate Trust Business Employee who receives a Comparable Job Offer from BNY and does not accept such offer; PROVIDED, that if Severance Benefits are required to be paid or provided under Applicable Law, the cost allocation provisions of this Section 13.1(e)(ii) shall apply. BNY shall (i) reimburse JPM for the full cost of any Severance Benefits paid to a Corporate Trust Business Employee who BNY identified as a Selected Non-Automatic Transfer Employee, but to whom BNY did not ultimately make a Comparable Job Offer and (ii) be 118
fully liable and indemnify JPM for the full cost of any Severance Benefits paid to a Selected Automatic Transfer Employee who is dismissed by BNY following the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 13.1(e)(ii) is intended to conflict with the provisions of Section 13.1(k), but in the event of an inconsistency, Section 13.1(e)(ii) shall govern. Subject to Applicable Law, BNY and JPM shall cooperate to take commercially reasonable steps to reduce, to the extent possible, the likelihood that any of the parties will have to pay Severance Benefits to any Corporate Trust Business Employees who do not become Transferred Corporate Trust Employees or who were Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in no event, shall JPM or BNY be required to find alternative employment for such employees at JPM or BNY or one of their respective Affiliates. In addition, in the event a Non-Selected Automatic Transfer Employee asserts that he or she became an employee of BNY as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, BNY shall (i) within ten (10) Business Days of BNY first becoming aware of such claim of transferred employment, provide such Employee with a notice of termination of employment to be effective immediately, (ii) take such other action as is necessary to effectuate such termination of employment with BNY and (iii) immediately notify JPM of such claim, and thereafter JPM shall control such claim (including in respect of any settlement related thereto), although BNY agrees to cooperate with JPM in connection with any such proceedings or such settlement. (f) RETIREMENT PLANS. Effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, JPM shall take action to provide that the account balances and accrued benefits, as applicable, of all Transferred Corporate Trust Employees under the tax-qualified employee savings plan(s) (the "JPM'S SAVINGS PLAN") and pension plan(s) that are sponsored by JPM in the United States in which the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing Date shall vest in full. BNY shall take all action necessary to permit BNY's tax-qualified employee savings plan(s) maintained in the United States to, during the 90 day period following the Closing Date, accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code, but excluding any after-tax contributions and amounts attributable thereto) made to the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees from the JPM's Savings Plan. For purposes of this Section, the term "eligible rollover distribution" shall include (i) the amount of any unpaid balance of any loan made to a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee under the JPM's Savings Plan and (ii) the promissory note (or other documentation) evidencing such loan. Prior to the Closing Date, JPM shall take all action necessary to effectuate the agreement set forth on SCHEDULE 13.1(f). (g) VACATION TIME. For the remainder of the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs, a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee shall be entitled to vacation time benefits pursuant to the terms of JPM's vacation time policy as in effect on the Closing Date (subject to ordinary course limits on vacation scheduling), with full recognition of and credit for his or her accrued and unused vacation time for the portion of such calendar year ending as of the Closing Date (except to the extent a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee receives a cash payment in satisfaction of accrued and unused vacation time as provided in the following sentence) and with accruals for the remaining 119
portion of such calendar year in accordance with JPM's vacation time policy as in effect on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Applicable Law requires that in connection with the transaction accrued and unused vacation time be satisfied through a cash payment, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, JPM shall pay to each applicable Transferred Corporate Trust Employee an amount in cash in respect of all unused vacation time that has been accrued with respect to such Employee through the Closing Date, and BNY shall have no liability with respect thereto. With respect to calendar years commencing after the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Transferred Corporate Trust Employees shall be eligible for vacation time benefits in accordance with BNY's vacation time policy applicable to similarly situated employees of BNY. (h) ASSUMPTION OF CORPORATE TRUST EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Effective as of the Closing Date, BNY shall assume (and shall have taken all action required to effectuate such assumption) all Corporate Trust Employment Agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 6.12(b) with the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees. (i) 2006 ANNUAL INCENTIVES FOR PRE-CLOSING PERIOD. BNY shall pay the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees, as a group, incentive bonuses with respect to the portion of the calendar year commencing on January 1, 2006 and ending on the Closing Date in an aggregate amount of at least the amount accrued in respect of annual bonuses for the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees as reflected on the Final Corporate Trust Closing Statement (the "CORPORATE TRUST PRE-CLOSING ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS POOL"). The allocation to individual Transferred Corporate Trust Employees of the Corporate Trust Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be made by BNY consistent with BNY's past practice, taking into consideration JPM's past practice (and with respect to any allocation to a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee who is terminated prior to the BNY Payment Date shall reflect his or her contributions through the date of termination). The allocated bonus amounts from the Corporate Trust Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be paid in cash to Transferred Corporate Trust Employees on the earlier of the date on which BNY pays annual bonuses to similarly situated employees of BNY and March 15, 2007 (the earlier date, referred to herein as the "BNY PAYMENT DATE"). If, after the Closing Date and prior to the BNY Payment Date, a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee's employment is terminated by BNY under circumstances entitling him or her to severance, any bonus amount allocated to such employee from the Corporate Trust Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be paid by BNY to such employee on the BNY Payment Date. For purposes of the terms of the Comparable Job Offers to Corporate Trust Business Employees, BNY has relied upon the Final Corporate Trust Closing Statement including an accrual for the Corporate Trust Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool. (j) DELAYED HIRE/TRANSFER DATE EMPLOYEES. (i) REGULATORY DELAYED TRANSFER EMPLOYEES. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that, on the Closing Date, the job function of a Selected Corporate Trust Business Employee is not permitted to be performed by BNY due to BNY having not received a required consent, approval or license from a third party (including any Governmental Authority) as contemplated by 120
Section 10.9, such Selected Corporate Trust Business Employee's commencement of employment with BNY shall be delayed until the date on which BNY is first able to employ such person in such job function. For purposes hereof, a Selected Corporate Trust Business Employee whose employment with BNY is delayed for the reasons described in the foregoing sentence shall be referred to herein as a "REGULATORY DELAYED TRANSFER EMPLOYEE." A Regulatory Delayed Transfer Employee shall become a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee as of the first date on which BNY is able to employ such person in his or her job function and, to the extent applicable, references in this Section 13.1 to the "Closing Date" shall relate to the date on which active employment with BNY commences. Until such time as a Regulatory Delayed Transfer Employee's active employment with BNY commences, (i) except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or upon BNY's consent, JPM shall abide by the limitations set forth in Sections 11.1(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) and Section 11(b)(2) with regard to the terms of such Regulatory Delayed Transfer Employee's employment with JPM, and (ii) the costs incurred by JPM for the employment of such Regulatory Delayed Transfer Employee shall be reimbursed by BNY to JPM in accordance with the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement; PROVIDED that, the costs reimbursable by BNY to JPM shall also include the cost of Severance Benefits in the event a Regulatory Delayed Transfer Employee's employment is terminated by JPM following the Closing Date. (ii) DELAYED HIRE EMPLOYEES. To the extent that, within fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Corporate Trust Transition Support Agreement), BNY employs a Corporate Trust Business Employee (other than a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee) whose employment with JPM has been uninterrupted from the period commencing immediately prior to the Closing Date and ending immediately prior to the date active employment with BNY commences, such Employee shall become a Transferred Corporate Trust Employee as of the date active employment with BNY commences and, to the extent applicable, references in this Section 13.1 to the "Closing Date" shall relate to the date active employment with BNY commences. (k) WARN ACT. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith, including by sharing information about terminations of employment in a timely manner, to determine whether any notification may be required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar state or local law (collectively, the "WARN ACT") as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. BNY shall be responsible for providing any notice (or pay in lieu of notice) required pursuant to the WARN Act with respect to a layoff or plant closing involving Transferred Corporate Trust Employees that occurs on or after the Closing Date. Subject to Section 13.1(e)(ii), JPM shall be responsible for providing any such notice (or pay in lieu of notice) with respect to a layoff or plant closing occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date and involving Corporate Trust Business Employees who do not become Transferred Corporate Trust Employees; PROVIDED that, to the extent such layoff or plant closing arises due to the termination of (or the provision of WARN notice to) Corporate Trust Business Employees who BNY has identified as Selected Corporate Trust Business Employee but to whom 121
BNY did not ultimately make a Comparable Job Offer as and when contemplated by Section 13.1(a), BNY shall reimburse JPM for the WARN related costs incurred by JPM during any portion of the period of notice (or pay in lieu of notice) from and after the Closing Date. (l) EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS. Any communications by BNY with the Corporate Trust Business Employees prior to the Closing Date shall be subject to and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Written communications from BNY to Corporate Trust Business Employees shall be subject to review, comment and approval by JPM. JPM shall not make any promises or commitments to the Corporate Trust Business Employees with respect to employment by BNY or the terms and conditions thereof. (m) NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. No provision of this Section 13.1 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Corporate Trust Business Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof). Nothing contained herein shall prevent BNY from terminating the employment of any Transferred Corporate Trust Employee or amending or terminating the terms of any benefit plan. (n) TRAINING. JPM shall permit BNY to train the Corporate Trust Business Employees to whom BNY intends to make offers of employment before the Closing Date with regard to BNY's operations, policies and procedures at BNY's sole cost and expense, including without limitation any overtime pay due to employees. At BNY's election, this training may take place during or outside of business hours; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any training that occurs shall be conducted in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the Corporate Trust Business. Section 13.2 BANKING BUSINESS. (a) OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT. Commencing on the date hereof and ending ninety (90) calendar days hereafter, BNY shall provide JPM with reasonable access to each of the Banking Business Employees. On or prior to the end of such ninety-(90)-day period, JPM shall provide BNY with a list of those Banking Business Employees to whom JPM will make a Comparable Job Offer (the "SELECTED BANKING BUSINESS EMPLOYEES"). Subject to Applicable Law, at least thirty (30) days (unless an earlier date is required by Applicable Law) prior to the Closing Date and effective as of the Closing Date, JPM shall make, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be accepted, a Comparable Job Offer to all Selected Banking Business Employees. A Comparable Job Offer may be conditioned upon (i) completing a standard and customary written employment application with JPM and (ii) satisfying pre-employment screening requirements, except that drug testing, fingerprinting and a criminal background check shall be considered satisfied to the extent BNY reaffirms to JPM the representation made in the last sentence of Section 8.17(a) (the "JPM JOB OFFER CONDITION"). The Selected Banking Business Employees (and any other Banking Business Employees) who (i) accept JPM's offer of employment and satisfy the JPM Job Offer Condition or (ii) otherwise become employees of JPM by operation of Applicable Law are referred to herein as the "TRANSFERRED BANKING EMPLOYEES." JPM's employment of the Transferred Banking Employees shall be deemed to commence at 12:01 a.m. on the 122
Closing Date, without regard to whether the Transferred Banking Employee is actively at work on the Closing Date in the case of an employee who on the Closing Date is absent from work due to a vacation, jury duty, funeral leave or personal day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a Banking Business Employee who has accepted JPM's offer is not available to perform services on the Closing Date because on the Closing Date such employee is on sick leave, short or long-term disability, military leave, leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act or other leave of absence approved by BNY (other than a vacation, jury duty, funeral leave or personal day), he or she shall remain an employee of BNY (except as may otherwise be provided by Applicable Law); PROVIDED that JPM shall hire such Banking Business Employee if such Employee returns to work no later than the date that is the earlier of the scheduled return date (including any approved extensions thereto) and six months from the date of commencement of such leave and, for purposes of this Agreement, such Employee shall become a Transferred Banking Employee as of the date active employment with JPM commences and, to the extent applicable, references in this Section 13.2 to the "Closing Date" shall relate to the date on which active employment commences. Those Banking Business Employees who do not receive, or do not accept, a Comparable Job Offer from JPM, and those Banking Business Employees whose employment does not transfer to JPM by operation of Applicable Law, shall not be considered Transferred Banking Employees for any purpose of this Agreement. (b) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH BNY. As of the Closing Date, the Transferred Banking Employees shall cease active participation in each Banking Employee Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 13.2 (or as otherwise provided by Applicable Law), BNY shall retain all assets and liabilities for the Banking Business Employees under the Banking Employee Plans. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, BNY shall be liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the Banking Employee Plans that are welfare plans that are incurred by the Transferred Banking Employees prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment, business travel accident, short-term disability and workers compensation insurance benefits, upon the event giving rise to such benefits; (ii) health, vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits, on the date such services, materials or supplies were provided; and (iii) long-term disability benefits, on the eligibility date determined by the long-term disability carrier for the plan in which the individual participates. Prior to the Closing Date, BNY shall amend the applicable BNY equity incentive and compensation plans to provide for the vesting of equity incentive awards held by the Transferred Banking Employees and the deferred bonus accounts of the Transferred Banking Employees as set forth in SCHEDULE 13.2(b). (c) BENEFITS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING DATE. Effective as of the Closing Date, JPM shall provide the Transferred Banking Employees with the same employee benefit plans and programs as those that are provided to similarly situated employees of JPM (both by job classification or status and by geographic location). For purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate in and vesting under any employee benefit plan of 123
JPM or its Affiliates, (ii) the banking privileges and perquisites applicable to the Transferred Banking Employees and (iii) retirement eligibility under any JPM plan providing for the grant of equity awards, and for benefit accrual purposes only for vacation, sickness benefits and severance benefits (if any), each Transferred Banking Employee shall be credited with the years of service he or she has been credited with under the comparable Banking Employee Plans; PROVIDED that such service shall not be recognized for purposes of (i) grandfathering, benefit accruals and/or level of pay credits under any JPM defined benefit retirement plan and (ii) retiree medical benefits (but it shall be recognized for access only retiree medical). JPM shall (i) waive any preexisting conditions and waiting periods under the welfare benefit plans of JPM that provide healthcare benefits in which the Transferred Banking Employees are eligible to participate to the same extent that such conditions and waiting periods were waived under the comparable Banking Employee Plan, and (ii) subject to BNY providing JPM with the applicable information with respect to each Transferred Banking Employee in a form that JPM determines is administratively feasible to take into account under its plans, cause such plans (other than HMOs) to honor any expenses incurred by such Banking Employees and their eligible dependents under Banking Employee Plans that are healthcare benefit plans during the portion of the calendar year in which they become employees of JPM for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance, maximum out-of-pocket, and similar expenses, to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable Banking Employee Plan. (d) COBRA. BNY shall be responsible for the administration of and shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage with respect to Transferred Banking Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries for "qualifying events" occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and JPM shall be responsible for all obligations and liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage for Transferred Banking Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries with respect to "qualifying events" occurring after the Closing Date. BNY shall retain any and all obligations and liabilities for COBRA continuation coverage for all Banking Business Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries who are not Transferred Banking Employees. (e) SEVERANCE. (i) TERMINATION OF TRANSFERRED BANKING EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING THE CLOSING DATE. JPM shall pay severance and provide benefits in accordance with the severance schedule set forth on SCHEDULE 13.2(e)(i), to each Transferred Banking Employee whose employment is terminated by JPM without "cause" (as defined under JPM's policies and practices) within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, subject to the execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of JPM, BNY and their respective Affiliates. (ii) TERMINATION OF BANKING BUSINESS EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT BECOME TRANSFERRED BANKING EMPLOYEES. With respect to Banking Business Employees who do not become Transferred Banking Employees for any reason (other than due to having rejected a Comparable Job Offer), whether due to the fact that such Employees were not Selected Banking Business Employees or due to the fact that they do 124
not transfer (including, with respect to persons employed outside of the United States, due to refusal to transfer JPM) under Applicable Law, BNY shall retain and shall satisfy all Severance Benefits. Except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law, neither BNY, JPM nor any of their respective Affiliates shall pay or provide Severance Benefits to any Banking Business Employee who receives a Comparable Job Offer from JPM and does not accept such offer; PROVIDED that, if Severance Benefits are required to be paid or provided under Applicable Law, the cost allocation provisions of this Section 13.2(e)(ii) shall apply. JPM shall reimburse BNY for the full cost of any Severance Benefits paid to a Banking Business Employee who JPM identified as a Selected Banking Business Employee, but to whom JPM did not ultimately make a Comparable Job Offer. Nothing in this Section 13.2(e)(ii) is intended to conflict with the provisions of Section 13.2(k), but in the event of an inconsistency, Section 13.2(e)(ii) shall govern. Subject to Applicable Law, BNY and JPM shall cooperate to take commercially reasonable steps to reduce, to the extent possible, the likelihood that any of the parties will have to pay Severance Benefits to any Banking Business Employees who do not become Transferred Banking Employees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in no event, shall JPM or BNY be required to find alternative employment for such employees at JPM or BNY or one of their respective Affiliates. (f) RETIREMENT PLANS. Effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, BNY shall take action to provide that the account balances and accrued benefits, as applicable, of all Transferred Banking Employees under the tax-qualified employee savings plan(s) (the "BNY'S SAVINGS PLAN") and pension plan(s) that are sponsored by BNY in the United States in which the Transferred Banking Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing Date shall vest in full. JPM shall take all action necessary to permit JPM's tax-qualified employee savings plan(s) maintained in the United States to, during the 90 day period following the Closing Date, accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code, but excluding any after-tax contributions and amounts attributable thereto) made to the Transferred Banking Employees from BNY's Savings Plan. For purposes of this Section, the term "eligible rollover distribution" shall include (i) the amount of any unpaid balance of any loan made to a Transferred Banking Employee under BNY's Savings Plan and (ii) the promissory note (or other documentation) evidencing such loan. In addition and subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date, in substitution for the 2% contribution and match under BNY's Savings Plan, prior to December 31, 2006, BNY shall pay the Transferred Corporate Trust Employees an amount in cash equal to 2% of each such Employee's compensation (as determined for this purpose under the terms of BNY's Savings Plan) earned through the Closing Date for the year in which the Closing Date occurs. Prior to the Closing Date, BNY shall take all action necessary to effectuate the agreement set forth on SCHEDULE 13.2(f). (g) VACATION TIME. For the remainder of the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs, a Transferred Banking Employee shall be entitled to vacation time benefits pursuant to the terms of BNY's vacation time policy as in effect on the Closing Date (subject to ordinary course limits on vacation scheduling), with full recognition of and credit for his or her accrued and unused vacation time for the portion of 125
such calendar year ending as of the Closing Date (except to the extent a Transferred Banking Employee receives a cash payment in satisfaction of accrued and unused vacation time as provided in the following sentence) and with accruals for the remaining portion of such calendar year in accordance with BNY's vacation time policy as in effect on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Applicable Law requires that in connection with the transaction accrued and unused vacation time be satisfied through a cash payment, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, BNY shall pay to each applicable Transferred Banking Employee an amount in cash in respect of all unused vacation time that has been accrued with respect to such Employee through the Closing Date, and JPM shall have no liability with respect thereto. With respect to calendar years commencing after the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Transferred Banking Employees shall be eligible for vacation time benefits in accordance with JPM's vacation time policy applicable to similarly situated employees of JPM. (h) ASSUMPTION OF BANKING EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Effective as of the Closing Date, JPM shall assume (and shall have taken all action required to effectuate such assumption) all Banking Employment Agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 8.17(B) with the Transferred Banking Employees.

The allocation to individual Transferred Banking Employees of the Banking Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be made by JPM consistent with JPM's past practice, taking into consideration BNY's past practice (and with respect to any allocation to a Transferred Banking Employee who is terminated prior to the JPM Payment Date shall reflect his or her contributions through the date of termination). The allocated bonus amounts from the Banking Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be paid in cash to Transferred Banking Employees on the earlier of the date on which JPM pays annual bonuses to similarly situated employees of JPM and March 15, 2007 (the earlier date, referred to herein as the "JPM PAYMENT DATE"). If, after the Closing Date and prior to the JPM Payment Date, a Transferred Banking Employee's employment is terminated by JPM under circumstances entitling him or her to severance, any bonus amount allocated to such employee from the Banking Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool shall be paid by JPM to such employee on the JPM Payment Date. For purposes of the terms of the Comparable Job Offers to Banking Business Employees, JPM has relied upon the Final Banking Closing Statement including an accrual for the Banking Pre-Closing Annual Incentive Bonus Pool. (j) DELAYED HIRES. To the extent that, within fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Banking Transition Support Agreement), JPM employs a Banking Business Employee (other than a Transferred 126
Banking Employee) whose employment with BNY has been uninterupted from the period commencing immediately prior to the Closing Date and ending immediately prior to the date active employment with JPM commences), such Employee shall become a Transferred Banking Employee as of the date active employment with JPM commences and, to the extent applicable, references in this Section 13.2 to the "Closing Date" shall relate to the date active employment with JPM commences. (k) WARN ACT. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith, including by sharing information about terminations of employment in a timely manner, to determine whether any notification may be required under the WARN Act as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subject to Section 13.2(e)(ii), BNY shall be responsible for providing any such notice (or pay in lieu of notice) with respect to a layoff or plant closing occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date and involving Banking Business Employees who do not become Transferred Banking Employees; PROVIDED that, to the extent such layoff or plant closing arises due to the termination of (or the provision of WARN notice to) Banking Business Employees who JPM has identified as Selected Banking Business Employee but to whom JPM did not ultimately make a Comparable Job Offer, as and when contemplated by Section 13.2(a), JPM shall reimburse BNY for the WARN related costs incurred by JPM during any portion of the period of notice (or pay in lieu of notice) from and after the Closing Date. (l) EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS. Any communications by JPM with the Banking Business Employees prior to the Closing Date shall be subject to and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) All Transfer Taxes that are payable or that arise as a result of the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Banking Assets contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50%/50% by each of JPM and BNY. JPM agrees to timely sign and deliver any certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns with respect to, such Transfer Taxes.

(a) Without prejudice to Section 14.11, the parties will use reasonable efforts to treat the sale of the Purchased Corporate Trust Assets in the United Kingdom as a sale of a going concern for UK VAT purposes and accordingly: (1) JPM and BNY shall (when required to do so) give notice of such sale to H.M. Customs & Excise pursuant to paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 Value Added Tax Act 1994 ("VATA 1994") or paragraph 6 of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (the "ORDER") or as otherwise required by law; and (2) JPM shall on Closing make available to BNY, to the extent related to the Corporate Trust Business, all records referred to in Section 49 VATA 1994. (b) Without prejudice to Section 14.11, JPM and BNY shall use all reasonable endeavors to secure that the sale of the Purchased Corporate Trust Assets is treated under the Value Added Tax (Special Provision) Order 1995 as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services and JPM and BNY shall promptly agree the form of a letter to be sent by JPM to H.M. Customs & Excise before Closing seeking confirmation that the sale is to be so treated. (c) BNY represents and warrants to JPM that the purchaser of the Purchased Corporate Trust Assets in the United Kingdom will be an entity that is registered for UK VAT purposes. Section 14.7 VAT. Where the sale of any assets (other than any assets the sale of which falls within the scope of UK VAT) gives rise to a supply by JPM for purposes of VAT and VAT is chargeable on such supply for which JPM is required to account to the relevant Taxing Authority, and the parties can do nothing, and the sale cannot be so structured (in each case, with reason) as to result in the sale giving rise to neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services or there being no VAT being payable in respect of such sale: (a) JPM shall issue to BNY a valid VAT invoice in respect of such supply no later than the due date for payment of the stated consideration for such supply, and within all applicable time limits, will cause such valid VAT invoice to be complete in all respects and will not (i) adjust the taxable value of such supply once the VAT invoice in respect of such supply has been issued to BNY or (ii) make any claim in relation to such supply pursuant to any equivalent section 36 of the United Kingdom Valued Added Tax Act 1994 or Part XIX of the Order; (b) BNY shall promptly apply for a repayment or credit from the relevant Taxing Authority in respect of such VAT, and BNY shall be obligated to pay over the amount of such repayment or credit it receives or utilizes (such amount, the "VAT Repayment Amount") to JPM within 30 days after the date on which it receives such repayment or utilizes such credit. To the extent that BNY does not receive such repayment or credit from the relevant Taxing Authority, BNY shall pay to JPM, in addition to the 132
VAT Repayment Amount, an amount equal to 50% of the excess of the amount of VAT paid over the VAT Repayment Amount, if any; and (c) BNY and JPM shall reasonably cooperate to minimize VAT liability to the extent legally permissible. Section 14.8 COORDINATION. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event there is a conflict between Article XIV and any provision contained in any other Article of this Agreement, Article XIV shall control. Section 14.9 TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.

In the event that the parties are unable to reach such agreement within such period, each party shall be entitled to determine and report its own treatment of the Corporate Trust Sale and the Banking Sale for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. JPM and BNY shall attempt in good faith to agree on and jointly retain a third-party appraisal firm in connection with this Section 14.11 and shall equally share all fees and expenses charged with respect to any such jointly retained appraisal firm and, unless both parties agree otherwise in writing, shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the valuations contained in any such appraisal.
