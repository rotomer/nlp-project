Item 4.02 (a): Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
On the date hereof, JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorganChase" or the "Firm") is filing an amended Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 to restate the Consolidated statements of cash flows for the annual periods of 2005, 2004 and 2003 contained therein and is filing an amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 to restate the Consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the quarterly periods of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. The restatements will not affect the Firm's Consolidated statements of income, Consolidated balance sheets or Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity for any of the affected periods. Accordingly, the Firm's historical revenues, net income, earnings per share, total assets and regulatory capital remain unchanged.
The restatements result solely from the misclassification of cash flows related to certain residential mortgages and other loans that had been originated or purchased with the intent to sell. The cash flows from these loans had been classified as investing activities. However, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 102, "Statement of Cash FlowsExemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale," cash flows from these loans should have been, and in the future will be, classified as operating activities, rather than investing activities. Accordingly, the restatements will solely affect the classification of these activities and the subtotals of cash flows from operating and investing activities presented in the affected Consolidated statements of cash flows, but they will have no impact on the net increase (decrease) in total Cash and due from banks set forth in the Consolidated statements of cash flows for any of the previously reported periods.
On August 3, 2006, management recommended to the Audit Committee that the Firm's previously issued Consolidated financial statements for the full years 2005, 2004 and 2003 and for each of the quarterly periods of 2006 and 2005 should no longer be relied upon and that the Consolidated statements of cash flows for such periods should be restated.
The Audit Committee of JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors agreed with the above conclusions. In addition, management and the Audit Committee have discussed these matters with the Firm's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
