Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
Effective November 30, 2006, Mitchell & Titus, LLP ("Mitchell & Titus") resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for The JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Plan"). Mitchell & Titus informed the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the "Audit Committee") that its resignation relates to it becoming a member firm of Ernst & Young Global on such date.
The Audit Committee has accepted this resignation. A new independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan has not yet been engaged.
Mitchell & Titus was engaged as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan in 2005 and 2004 and, except for services rendered in connection with its audit of the financial statements of the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, has not rendered any other services to the Plan.
The report of Mitchell & Titus on the Plan's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. During such year-end periods and the interim period of January 1, 2006 through November 30, 2006, there have been (1) no disagreements with Mitchell & Titus on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not satisfactorily resolved would have caused Mitchell & Titus to make reference thereto in their financial statement reports; and (2) no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(v)).
The Plan requested that Mitchell & Titus furnish the Securities and Exchange Commission with a letter stating whether or not Mitchell & Titus agrees with the above statements, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1.
