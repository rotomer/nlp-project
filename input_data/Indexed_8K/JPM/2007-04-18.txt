Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commenting on the quarter said, "We are very pleased with our record results this quarter, which reflected the strength of our broad and diversified franchise. Across all of our businesses, we experienced continued growth in client volumes, including new accounts, loans, deposits and new business.

The firm's strong results include some benefit from the generally favorable credit environment, which we do not expect to continue indefinitely." Commenting on The Bank of New York branch integration, Dimon noted, "Through the remarkable efforts of thousands of dedicated employees, we now have an integrated and much stronger retail banking business in the New York Tri-state area.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
In the discussion below of the business segments and JPMorgan Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 16).
The following discussion compares the first quarter of 2007 with the first quarter of 2006 unless otherwise noted.
INVESTMENT BANK (IB)
Net income was a record $1.5 billion, up by $690 million, or 81%, compared with the prior year and up by $531 million, or 53%, compared with the prior quarter. Earnings growth reflected record revenue and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Discussion of Results:
Net revenue was a record $6.3 billion, up 30% from the prior year, driven by record investment banking fees and record markets results. Investment banking fees of $1.7 billion were up 48% from the prior year driven by record debt and record equity underwriting as well as strong advisory fees. Debt underwriting fees of $864 million were up 52% driven by record bond underwriting fees and strong loan syndication fees, which benefited from both leveraged and high grade issuance. Advisory fees of $472 million were up 21%, with particular strength in the Americas. Equity underwriting fees of $393 million were up 85%, reflecting strength in common stock and convertible offerings in the Americas and Europe. Record Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.6 billion was up 25% from the prior year, benefiting from improved results in commodities (compared with a weak prior-year quarter) as well as strength in credit and rate markets, partially offset by lower results in currencies. Record Equity Markets revenue of $1.5 billion increased 22%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Europe as well as strong derivatives performance across regions. Credit Portfolio revenue of $394 million was up 23%, due to the incorporation of an adjustment to the valuation of the firm's derivative liabilities measured at fair value that reflects the credit quality of the firm, in conjunction with SFAS 157 ("Fair Value Measurements"), and higher trading revenue from hedging activities, partially offset by lower gains from loan workouts.
Provision for credit losses was $63 million compared with $183 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected growth in the loan portfolio.
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, up by $511 million, or 15%, from the prior year. This increase was due to higher compensation expense, primarily performance-based, partially offset by the absence of expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R in the prior-year quarter.
Highlights Include:
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES (RFS)
Net income of $859 million was down by $22 million, or 2%, from the prior year.
Discussion of Results:
Net revenue of $4.1 billion was up by $343 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was up 2% due to The Bank of New York transaction, higher home equity loans and deposit balances in Regional Banking, and wider loan spreads in Auto Finance. These benefits were offset partially by lower prime and subprime mortgage balances, the sale of the insurance business, lower auto loan and lease balances, and narrower spreads on deposits. Noninterest revenue of $1.5 billion was up by $288 million, or 24%. Results benefited from higher gain-on-sale income and the reclassification of certain loan origination costs to expense (previously netted against revenue) due to the adoption of SFAS 159 ("Fair Value Option") in Mortgage Banking; increases in depositrelated fee revenue; The Bank of New York transaction; and higher automobile operating lease revenue. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business, a charge resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuity contracts, and the absence of a prior-year loss related to auto loans transferred to held-for-sale.
The provision for credit losses of $292 million was up by $207 million from the prior year. This increase was due to higher losses in the subprime mortgage portfolio and, to a lesser extent, increased provision in the home equity portfolio related to weaker housing prices. These increases were offset partially by the reversal of a portion of the reserves related to Hurricane Katrina. The firm's exposure to subprime mortgages is deemed manageable, with current quarter outstandings of $9.0 billion and net charge-offs of $20 million (0.92% net charge-off rate), compared with $15.1 billion of loans and net charge-offs of $9 million (0.26% net charge-off rate) in the prior-year quarter. Given the firm's current expectations for continued poor loss experience in subprime mortgages, the provision for credit losses was increased and standards for underwriting were tightened this quarter. In addition, since weaker home prices are expected to continue to affect losses in the home equity portfolio, underwriting standards were tightened and the allowance for this portfolio was increased during the quarter.
Noninterest expense of $2.4 billion was up by $169 million, or 8%, primarily due to The Bank of New York transaction, the reclassification of certain loan origination costs due to the adoption of SFAS 159, investments in the retail distribution network and higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. These increases were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business.
net income of $690 million was down by $67 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Net revenue of $3.1 billion was up by $52 million, or 2%. Results benefited from The Bank of New York transaction; growth in home equity loans and deposits; and increases in deposit-related fees. These revenue benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business, a continued shift to narrower-spread deposit products, and a charge resulting from accelerated surrenders
Regional Banking
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
of customer annuity contracts. The provision for credit losses was $233 million, up by $167 million, primarily related to higher losses in the subprime mortgage portfolio and to a lesser extent increased provision in the home equity portfolio related to weaker housing prices. These increases were offset partially by the reversal of a portion of the reserves related to Hurricane Katrina. Noninterest expense of $1.7 billion was flat, as increases due to The Bank of New York transaction and investments in the retail distribution network were offset by the sale of the insurance business.
Highlights Include:
net income was $84 million compared with $39 million in the prior year. Net revenue of $604 million was up by $216 million, or 56%, from the prior year. Revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was $400 million, up by $181 million, reflecting higher gain-on-sale income and the reclassification of certain loan origination costs to expense (previously netted against revenue) due to the adoption of SFAS 159. Net mortgage servicing revenue, which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $204 million compared with $169 million in the prior year. Loan servicing revenue of $601 million increased by $41 million on a 13% increase in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management revenue of negative $19 million improved by $23 million from the prior year. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, representing run-off of
Mortgage Banking
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
the asset against the realization of servicing cash flows, were negative $378 million. Noninterest expense was $468 million, up by $144 million, or 44%, reflecting the reclassification of certain loan origination costs due to the adoption of SFAS 159 and higher compensation expense reflecting higher loan originations and a greater number of loan officers.
Highlights Include:
net income of $85 million was flat compared with the prior year. Net revenue of $410 million was up by $75 million, or 22%, reflecting the absence of a prior-year $50 million pretax loss related to auto loans transferred to held-for-sale, higher automobile operating lease revenue, and wider loan spreads on lower loan and direct finance lease balances. The provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $40 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting a reduction of the allowance for credit losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $210 million increased by $34 million, or 19%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases.
Auto Finance
Highlights Include:
CARD SERVICES (CS)
Net income of $765 million was down by $136 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Prior-year results benefited from significantly lower net charge-offs following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Discussion of Results:
End-of-period managed loans of $146.6 billion increased by $12.3 billion, or 9%, from the prior year and decreased by $6.3 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally higher payment activity. Average managed loans of $149.4 billion increased by $11.4 billion, or 8%, from the prior year and by $2.0 billion, or 1%, from the prior quarter. The current quarter included $2.0 billion of average and $1.9 billion of end-of-period managed loans acquired with the Kohl's private-label portfolio in the second quarter of 2006.
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
Net managed revenue was $3.7 billion, flat as compared with the prior year. Net interest income of $3.0 billion was down by $24 million, or 1%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher charge-offs, which resulted in increased revenue reversals in the current quarter and higher cost of funds on balance growth in promotional, introductory and transactor loan balances. These declines were offset partially by higher average managed loan balances and increased fees. Compared with the prior quarter, net interest income was up by $47 million, or 2%, driven by higher average managed loan balances, including growth in nonpromotional balances. Noninterest revenue of $691 million was up by $19 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Interchange income increased, benefiting from 9% higher charge volume, but was more than offset by higher volume-driven payments to partners and increased rewards expense (both of which are netted against interchange income). An additional factor impacting noninterest revenue was an increase in fee-based product revenue. Compared with the prior quarter, noninterest revenue was down by $117 million, or 14%, driven by seasonally lower net interchange income.
The managed provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, up by $213 million, or 21%, from the prior year. The prior-year quarter benefited from lower net charge-offs, which reflected a reduction in bankruptcy-related losses following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005. The current quarter benefited from an $85 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses, primarily related to strength in the underlying credit quality of the loan portfolio. Compared with the prior quarter, the managed provision for credit losses was down by $52 million, or 4%, which reflected an $85 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses, partially offset by a higher level of contractual charge-offs. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.57%, up from 2.99% in the prior year and 3.45% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.07%, down from 3.10% in the prior year and 3.13% in the prior quarter.
Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was flat compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower marketing expense and lower fraud-related losses, offset by recent acquisitions and higher expense reflecting increased customer activity.
Highlights Include:
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB)
Net income was a record $304 million, up by $64 million, or 27%, from the prior year, driven by higher net revenue.
Discussion of Results:
Net revenue was $1.0 billion, up by $103 million, or 11%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $668 million was flat. The benefit of higher liability balances and loan volumes, which reflected organic growth and The Bank of New York transaction, were offset largely by the continued shift to narrower-spread liability products and loan-spread compression. Noninterest revenue of $335 million was up by $102 million, or 44%, primarily due to higher investment banking revenue as well as gains related to the sale of securities acquired in the satisfaction of debt.
On a segment basis, Middle Market Banking revenue of $661 million increased by $38 million, or 6%, from the prior year due to growth across all product areas and The Bank of New York transaction. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue of $212 million increased by $75 million, or 55%, reflecting higher investment banking revenue and a gain on the sale of securities acquired in the satisfaction of debt. Real Estate revenue of $102 million decreased by $3 million, or 3%.
Provision for credit losses was $17 million compared with $7 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $485 million, down by $13 million, or 3%, from the prior year due to the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R primarily offset by expense related to The Bank of New York transaction.
Highlights Include:
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES (TSS)
Net income was $263 million, flat compared with the prior year. Earnings benefited from increased revenue and the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R, but these items were offset by higher compensation expense and investment in new product platforms.
Discussion of Results:
Net revenue was $1.5 billion, up by $41 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue of $837 million was up by $45 million, or 6%, driven by increased product usage by existing clients and new business growth, as well as market appreciation. These benefits were partially offset by lower foreign exchange revenue as a result of narrower market spreads. Treasury Services net revenue of $689 million was down by $4 million, or 1%, driven by a continued shift to narrower-spread liability products and price compression across all products, primarily offset by an increase in average liability balances from new and existing clients. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew to $2.1 billion, up by $59 million, or 3%. Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.3 billion, up by $14 million, or 1%.
Provision for credit losses was $6 million compared with a benefit of $4 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, up by $27 million, or 3%. The increase was due largely to higher compensation expense related to growth in headcount supporting increased client volume and investment in new product platforms, partially offset by the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R.
Highlights Include:
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM)
Net income was a record $425 million, up by $112 million, or 36%, from the prior year. Improved results were due to increased revenue and the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R, partially offset by higher compensation expense. Compared with the prior quarter, net income was up 4% due to higher asset management fees, lower noncompensation expense, a benefit from the provision for credit losses and seasonal tax preparation fees, partially offset by seasonally lower performance fees.
Discussion of Results:
Net revenue of $1.9 billion was up by $320 million, or 20%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue, principally fees and commissions, of $1.7 billion was up by $321 million, or 24%. This increase was due largely to increased assets under management and higher performance fees. Net interest income of $245 million was flat from the prior year, primarily due to a shift to narrowerspread deposit products offset by higher deposit and loan balances.
Private Bank revenue grew 27%, to $560 million, due to higher asset management and placement fees and higher deposit balances, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposits. Institutional revenue grew 27%, to $551 million, due to net asset inflows and performance fees. Retail revenue grew 19%, to $527 million, primarily due to net asset inflows and market appreciation. Private Client Services revenue of $266 million was flat compared with the prior year, as increased revenue from higher assets under management was offset by narrower spreads on deposits and loans.
Assets under supervision were $1.4 trillion, up 17%, or $198 billion, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, up 21%, or $180 billion, from the prior year. The increase was the result of net asset inflows in the institutional segment, primarily in liquidity and alternative products; retail flows, primarily in equity-related products; and market appreciation. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $342 billion, up by $18 billion.
Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $9 million compared with a benefit of $7 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was up by $137 million, or 12%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher compensation and increased minority interest expense related to Highbridge Capital Management, partially offset by the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R.

CORPORATE
Net income was $631 million compared with a net loss of $366 million in the prior year and net income of $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Compared with the prior year, results benefited from higher private equity gains and improved net interest income. In comparison with the prior quarter, the lower results primarily reflected the absence of both a $622 million gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business and the benefit of $359 million of tax audit resolutions.
Discussion of Results:
(see note (a,b) above)
Net revenue was $1.3 billion compared with negative $404 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the Private Equity and Treasury segments. Private equity gains were $1.3 billion compared with $237 million in the prior year, benefiting from a higher level of realized gains, a fair value adjustment on nonpublic investments of $464 million resulting from the adoption of SFAS 157 ("Fair Value Measurements"), and the reclassification of certain private equity carried interest to compensation expense. Treasury's results benefited from a $380 million increase in net interest income due to improved net interest spread, as well as the absence of $158 million of securities losses in prior year.
Noninterest expense was $354 million, up from $335 million in the prior year, reflecting the reclassification of certain private equity carried interest to compensation expense and lower recoveries related to certain material litigation, primarily offset by business efficiencies and the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R.
Discontinued operations include the related balance sheet and income statement activity of selected corporate trust businesses sold to The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Treasury & Securities Services. Net income from discontinued operations was $54 million in the prior year and $620 million in the prior quarter, which included a $622 million after-tax gain on sale.
Highlights Include:

JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM)
(a)
Net income was $4.8 billion, up by $1.7 billion, compared with $3.1 billion in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher managed revenue, partially offset by increased noninterest expense and higher managed provision for credit losses.
Discussion of Results:
Net managed revenue was $19.7 billion, up by $3.9 billion, or 25%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $12.2 billion was up by $3.0 billion, or 33%, reflecting the following: very strong private equity gains (including the impact of adoption of SFAS 157 ("Fair Value Measurements")); record markets revenue in the Investment Bank; record investment banking fees; increased asset management, administration, and commissions revenue; and improved mortgage fees (including the impact of adoption of SFAS 159 ("Fair Value Option")). Net interest income was $7.5 billion, up by $889 million, or 13%, due to improved trading net interest income; an improvement in the Corporate segment's net interest spread; an increase in consumer loans; the impact of The Bank of New York; and higher wholesale liabilities and consumer deposits. This increase was offset partially by a shift to narrower-spread consumer loans and deposits; and a shift to narrower-spread wholesale liabilities and loans.
The managed provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, up by $321 million, or 25%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $77 million for the quarter compared with a provision of $179 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected growth in the loan portfolio. Wholesale net recoveries were $6 million in the current quarter compared with net recoveries of $20 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rates of 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. The prior year benefited from a lower level of credit card net charge-offs, which reflected a low level of bankruptcy losses following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase from last year also reflects higher charge-offs and additions to the allowance for credit losses related to the subprime mortgage and home equity loan portfolios. The firm had total nonperforming assets
 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
of $2.4 billion at March 31, 2007, up by $73 million, or 3%, from the prior-year level of $2.3 billion.
Noninterest expense was $10.6 billion, up by $848 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Expense increased due to higher compensation expense, primarily incentive-based. In addition, expense growth was also driven by acquisitions and investments, as well as lower insurance recoveries related to certain material litigation. The increase in expense was offset partially by the absence of a prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R, as well as business divestitures and expense efficiencies.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release
The table below summarizes the impact to 2007 first-quarter net income and equity as a result of the implementation of these accounting standards.
JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), ("Share-Based Payment") as of January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock made in January 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. In addition, during the first quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated cost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees. Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees prior to January 1, 2006, have not been accelerated and will continue to be amortized over the original vesting periods. The incremental expense incurred during 2006 was noncash charges and represented accelerated recognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods.
FASB Statement No. 123R ("Share-Based Payment"):
Notes:
1.   In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm's and the lines' of business results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer's credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm's retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement (first quarter of 2007) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase's income statement from a reported to managed basis.
2.   Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). That presentation, which is referred to as "reported basis," provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's and the lines' of business results on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications that assumes credit card loans securitized by Card Services remain on the balance sheet and presents revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. These adjustments do not have any impact on Net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole. The impact of these adjustments are summarized below. For additional information about managed basis, please refer to the Glossary of Terms on page 32.

TSS FIRMWIDE METRICS
TSS firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenues and liability balances reported in other lines of business for customers who are also customers of those lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of Treasury Services ("TS") and TSS products and revenues, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenues and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary in order to understand the aggregate TSS business.

Average Managed Assets:
Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt/equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates under FIN 46R. The underlying obligations of the VIEs consist of short-term borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt. The related assets consist of trading assets, available- for-sale securities, loans and other assets.
Beneficial interest issued by consolidated VIEs:
In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy, whichever is earlier.
Contractual Credit Card Charge-off:
Includes Private Equity, Treasury and Corporate Other, which includes other centrally managed expenses and discontinued operations.
Corporate:
Card Services' managed results excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. Through securitization, the Firm transforms a portion of its credit card receivables into securities, which are sold to investors. The credit card receivables are removed from the Consolidated balance sheets through the transfer of the receivables to a trust, and the sale of undivided interests to investors that entitle the investors to specific cash flows generated from the credit card receivables. The Firm retains the remaining undivided interests as seller's interests, which are recorded in Loans on the Consolidated balance sheets. A gain or loss on the sale of credit card receivables to investors is recorded in Other Income. Securitization also affects the Firm's Consolidated statements of income as the aggregate amount of interest income, certain fee revenue and recoveries that is in excess of the aggregate amount of interest paid to the investors, gross credit losses and other trust expenses related to the securitized receivables are reclassified into credit card income.
Credit Card Securitizations:
A component of an entity that is classified as held-for-sale or that has been disposed of from ongoing operations in its entirety or piecemeal, and for which the entity will not have any significant, continuing involvement. A discontinued operation may be a separate major business segment, a component of a major business segment or a geographical area of operations of the entity that can be separately distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes.

Investment-grade:
A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications related to credit card securitizations and taxable equivalents. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level because it believes this provides information to investors in understanding the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.
Managed Basis:
Refers to credit card receivables on the Firm's balance sheet plus credit card receivables that have been securitized.
Managed Credit Card Receivables:
A measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the mark-to-market value is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Firm. When the mark-to-market value is negative, JPMorgan Chase owes the counterparty. In this situation, the Firm does not have repayment risk.
Mark-to-market exposure:
An agreement between two counterparties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. See FIN 39.

Accordingly, revenue from tax exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments.

The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded with income tax expense.
