Representations and Warranties of the Company.
(a) A Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-146731) relating to senior and subordinated debt securities and other securities of the Company is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Act that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof. Such registration statement, as amended as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 5 below), including the documents incorporated therein by reference, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement" and the prospectus relating to the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement setting forth the terms of the Securities, including all material incorporated by reference therein, in the form in which such prospectus and prospectus supplement have most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations (as defined below), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus".

(c) As of the time any Notes are issued and sold hereunder, the applicable Indenture will constitute a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and such Notes will have been duly authorized and executed, and when authenticated as provided in the applicable Indenture or the Procedures (as defined herein) and paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(d) The time of Sale Information, at each Time of Sale, and at the time of delivery of the Securities sold at such Time of Sale will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the Company makes no representation and warranty with respect to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Agent furnished to the Company in writing by such Agent expressly for use in such Time of Sale Information.

7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will in each case, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse each Agent and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that in each case the Company will not be liable to an Agent or person controlling such Agent in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution.
provided

(b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
 
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information relating to the Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that, as of the date of this Agreement, the statements set forth in the second sentence of the tenth paragraph and the fourteenth paragraph under the heading "Plan of Distribution" in the prospectus supplement forming a part of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Agents for inclusion in the Prospectus, and the Agents confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnifying party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution for liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered
 
the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any Agent on the other from the offering by it pursuant to this Agreement of the Securities that are the subject of the action (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the commissions or underwriting discounts received by such Agent relating to the Securities that are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through it pursuant to this Agreement or upon resale of Securities purchased by it from the Company exceed the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Agents' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations hereunder and are not joint.
8. In soliciting offers to purchase Securities pursuant to this Agreement and in performing its other obligations hereunder, each Agent is acting individually and not jointly with the other Agents and, except as contemplated by Section 11, is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but shall have no liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated. If the Company shall default in the performance of its obligation to deliver Securities to a Purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default and (ii) pay to each Agent any commission to which it would have been entitled had such Securities been delivered.
Status of Each Agent.
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as to the results thereof made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(h) to the extent actually incurred by or committed to by an Agent to the date of such termination, the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) shall remain in effect until the settlement of all pending deliveries of and payment for securities and the respective obligations of the Company and the Agents pursuant to Section 7 and the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 4(d) shall remain in effect.
Survival of Representations and Obligations.
 
10. This Agreement may be terminated as to any Agent at any time by the Company or such Agent upon one day's written notice.
Termination.
11. Any Agent may agree with the Company from time to time to purchase Securities from the Company as principal for its own account or for resale to one or more investors or other purchasers, including other broker-dealers. Each such purchase shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (other than the terms of Section 3 hereof) and will be deemed to include the provisions of Exhibit E hereto. Such supplemental agreement may be oral and, if oral, must be confirmed promptly in writing (which writing may include facsimile transmission) by such Agent to the Company. At the time of each purchase of Securities by an Agent as principal, such Agent and the Company shall agree on any requirements for an opinion of counsel, officer's certificate and letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP pursuant to paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) of Section 5 and the form of any approved Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to be used in connection with the sale of the relevant Securities.

The Company may also enter into similar agreements with Agents or other agents providing for the sale of securities other than the Securities. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, each Agent, the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and each Agent and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7, and no other person shall have any right or obligation hereunder. No assignment by the Company of its rights under this Agreement shall be effective without the prior written consent of each Agent, and no assignment by any Agent of its rights under this Agreement shall be effective without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company shall deliver to each Agent, at or promptly after the time it becomes an Agent, a copy of each document theretofore delivered to any Agent pursuant to Section 5 or 6.

Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will in each case, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse each Agent and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that in each case the Company will not be liable to an Agent or person controlling such Agent in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent through the Lead Agent specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Agent, severally but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
 
Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information relating to the Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent through the Lead Agent specifically for use therein; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third and fourth sentences of the fourth paragraph, the second sentence of the eighth paragraph and the fourteenth paragraph under the heading "Plan of Distribution" in the prospectus supplement forming a part of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Agents for inclusion in the Prospectus, and the Agents confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnifying party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution for liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 10(f) of the Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any Agent on the other from the offering by it pursuant to this Agreement
 
of the Securities that are the subject of the action (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the commissions or underwriting discounts received by such Agent relating to the Securities that are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through it pursuant to this Agreement or upon resale of Securities purchased by it from the Company exceed the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Agents' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations hereunder and are not joint.
9. In soliciting offers to purchase Securities pursuant to this Agreement and in performing its other obligations hereunder, each Agent is acting individually and not jointly with the other Agents and, except as contemplated by Section 4, is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but shall have no liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated. If the Company shall default in the performance of its obligation to deliver Securities to the Lead Agent on behalf of an Agent whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default and (ii) pay to each Agent any commission to which it would have been entitled had such Securities been delivered.
Status of Each Agent.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as to the results thereof made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5(h) to the extent actually incurred by or committed to by an Agent to the date of such termination, the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(b) shall remain in effect until the settlement of all pending deliveries of and payment for securities and the respective obligations of the Company and the Agents pursuant to Section 8 and the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(d) shall remain in effect.
Survival of Representations and Obligations.
11. (a) The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Securities under this Agreement at any time. The Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and

arrangements described in this Agreement. Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than one day's written notice of termination to all of the Agents, or, in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than one day's written notice of termination to the Company and the Lead Agent. The provisions of Sections 5(b), 5(e), 5(h), 8, 10 and 13 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
(a) Any Terms Agreement executed pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Lead Agent and by notice given to the Company at or prior to delivery of and payment for all the Securities, if (a) prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) trading in the common stock of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by Federal or New York authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis having an adverse effect on the financial markets of the United States and (b) the occurrence or consequences of any one or more of such events shall have, in the judgment of the Lead Agent, made it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information, any Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus. The provisions of Sections 5(b), 5(e), 5(h), 8, 10 and 13 hereof shall survive any termination of the Terms Agreement and this Agreement.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement with respect to any Agent, such Agent shall not receive any compensation except in connection with a purchase by it of Securities actually consummated, provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit the provisions of Section 8, and that reimbursement by the Company to an Agent of out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred by such Agent and to which such Agent is otherwise entitled as provided herein shall not be prohibited.
12. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Company shall be directed to it at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, Attention: Office of the Secretary (facsimile No. (212) 270-2966) and notices to any Agent shall be directed to it at the address set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

Certain Agreements of the Agents.
(a) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared and approved pursuant to Section 2(e) above, or (ii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Agent and approved by the Company in advance in writing.
 
(b) It has not and will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use any free writing prospectus that contains the final terms of the Securities unless such terms have previously been included in a free writing prospectus filed with the Commission.
(c) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the period when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Act) in connection with sales of Securities).
 
14. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and the executed counterparts shall together constitute a single instrument.
