Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.9(d), neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Company of this Agreement and/or the Merger to Company's stockholders, (ii) take any public action or make any public statement in connection with the meeting of Company stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such recommendation or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a "
Change of Recommendati on
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only if, each of the following conditions is satisfied:
          
(i)
it receives an unsolicited Alternative Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn;
          
(ii) Company has not breached any of the provisions set forth in Section 6.3 or this Section 6.9;
          
(iii) it reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), that in light of a Superior Proposal the failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to Company stockholders under applicable law;
          
(iv) Parent has received written notice from Company (a "
Change of Recommendation Notice
") at least five business days prior to such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that Company has received a Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company has determined is a Superior Proposal and that Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and
the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so and (2) include the identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal and a copy (if in writing) and summary of material terms of such Alternative Proposal;
provided
that any material amendment to the terms of such Alternative Proposal shall require a Change of Recommendation Notice at least two business days prior to such Change of Recommendation; and
          
(v)
during any such notice period, Company and its advisors have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.
     
As used in this Agreement, "
Superior Proposal
" means any proposal made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or 100% of the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Company's stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.
     
(e)
Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.9 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.9 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.9 by Company.
     
(f)
Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.

(ii) Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition

(f) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.
     
(g) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "
Notice

Closing Date
");
provided
that if prior notification to or approval of any regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursua nt to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.

provided
that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.
     
(i) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (h) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.
     
(j) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:
"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."
     
It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
1933 Act
"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.
     
(k) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (g) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.
     
3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including in the event any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices a nd providing such information to such regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.
     
4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "
Agreement
" and "
Option
" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option gran ted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.
     
5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder.
     
6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("
Option Shares
") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing o f the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced;
provided
,
however
, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and
provided
further
,
however
, t hat if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstandi ng anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.
     
7. (a) Immediately prior to, or after, the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder immediately prior to the Repurchase Event (or, as requested by the Holder, after the Repurchase Event) at a price (the "
Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "
O wner
"), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days of the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "
Option Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "
Market/Offer Price
" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the hig hest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.
     
(b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (i) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (ii) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the O ption Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
     
(c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
,
however
, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase purs uant to paragraph
(b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evid encing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.
     
(d) For purposes of this Section 7, a "
Repurchase Event
" shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction with respect to Issuer (and not solely involving Issuer and/or one or more subsidiaries of Issuer) (except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be 50%) or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.
     
8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "
Substitute Option
"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.

Average Price
" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale;
provided
that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may el ect.
     
(c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,
provided
, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
     
(d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
     
(e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "
Substitute Option Issuer
") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determine d by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.
     
(f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder.
9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the
"
Substitute Option Holder
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "
Substitute Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "
Substitute Share Owner
") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "
Substitute
Shares
"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "
Substitute Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "
Highest Closing Price
" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.

As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certifica tes representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
     
(c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
,

If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.
     
18. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement.
