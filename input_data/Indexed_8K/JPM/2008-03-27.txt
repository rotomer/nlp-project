Forward-Looking Statements
     This filing contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between JPMorgan Chase & Co. and The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
     The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain governmental and self-regulatory organization approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule and any changes to regulatory agencies' outlook on, responses to and actions and commitments taken in connection with the merger and the agreements and arrangements related thereto; the extent and duration of continued economic and market disruptions; adverse developments in the business and operations of Bear Stearns, including the loss of client, employee, counterparty and other business relationships; the failure of Bear Stearns stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any other synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; increased competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the United States and internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions. Additional factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

(vi) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Obligation, any Obligation Document, any Underlying Liability or any documentation with respect thereto,
     
(vii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Guarantor or any Primary Obligor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Guarantor or any Primary Obligor or their respective assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation,
     
(viii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the Guarantor may have at any time against the Primary Obligor, any JPM Party or any other corporation or person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions,
     
(ix) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the Primary Obligor may have at any time against the any JPM Party or any other corporation or person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, or

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any other Guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
     
Section 2.04.
Reinstatement
. Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any JPM Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the applicable Primary Obligor, any Guarantor or otherwise.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to a JPM Party under this guarantee, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amoun ts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the JPM Parties under or in respect of the Obligations.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, JPM (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably agrees that the Obligations of each Subsidiary Party under this guarantee at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(c) Any Pledged Securities required to be delivered pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 3.01 shall be accompanied by stock powers or note powers, as applicable, duly executed in blank or other instruments of transfer reasonably satisfactory to JPM and by such other instruments and documents as JPM may reasonably request.

Security Interest
") in all right, title and interest in, to or under any and all of the following assets and properties now owned or at any time hereafter acquired by such Pledgor or in which such Pledgor now has or at any time in the future may acquire any right, title or interest (collectively, the "

"):

(xi) all Letter of Credit Rights; (xii) all Commercial Tort Claims; (xiii) all Intellectual Property;

(xvi) to the extent not otherwise included, and subject to Article III, all proceeds, products, accessions, substitutions, supporting obligations and products of any and all of the foregoing (including interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, in exchange for or upon the conversion of any of the foregoing) or of any other property of the Pledgors and all collateral security and guarantees given by any person with respect to any of the foregoing, including all shares, securities, moneys or property representing a dividend on any of the foregoing, or representing a distribution or return of capital upon or in respect of any of the foregoing or otherwise received in exchange therefor, and any subscription warrants, rights or options issued to the holders or otherwise in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
     
(A) to the extent that the creation of the Security Interest on any specified portion of the Collateral (the "Restricted Collateral") to secure any specified portion of the Obligations (the "Restricted Obligations") would give rise to (x) an obligation or obligations under any contracts, agreements or instruments binding on any Pledgor or its property to provide an equal and ratable (or other) lien on the Restricted Collateral to secure liabilities of any Pledgor or Pledgors in an aggregate amount that is material to BSC and its Affiliates taken as a whole or (y) a default, event of default or similar condition however denominated that (with or without the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both) would permit (1) the holder of any indebtedness (or commitment to provide indebtedness) for borrowed money in an amount material to the applicable Pledgor to accelerate the maturity (or term inate the commitment to provide) thereof, or (2) the holder of any indebtedness for borrowed money to accelerate the maturity thereof if the effect of such acceleration would, in turn, be to permit the holder of any other indebtedness or counterparty(ies) to any Financial Contract(s) in an aggregate amount material to any of BSC or its Subsidiaries party to any affected Financial Contract to accelerate or terminate such indebtedness or Financial Contract(s), then, in any such case under (x) or (y), the Security Interest with respect to such Restricted Collateral shall not secure such Restricted Obligations to such extent (and shall secure such Restricted Obligations upon the removal or termination of the applicable agreement or condition under (x) or (y)). Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, (aa) the Security Interest on any shares of Voting Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary (as such terms are defined, respectively, in the Indenture and the Note Issuance Agreement) shall not secure Obliga tions consisting of indebtedness for borrowed money until indebtedness outstanding under the Indenture and Note Issuance Agreement shall be repaid or defeased in full, and (bb) the Security Interest shall not extend to Equity Interests if a lien thereon would violate Ownership Limitations for so long as the applicable agreement is in effect; and
     
(B) subject to the provisos of this paragraph, this Agreement shall not constitute a grant of a security interest in:
provided
, that any such asset shall immediately, without further act or deed, become subject to the Security Interest upon termination or lapse of the agreement or condition set forth above with respect to such asset; and
provided
,
further
that JPM shall in any event, except to the extent that the granting thereof would independently violate any of (i) through (vii) above, have and retain a lien in the proceeds of any such asset. With respect to any asset excluded from the Security Interest pursuant to subsections (i)  (x) above, any lien purported to be granted hereunder in a ny such asset shall immediately and automatically, with no further act or deed become null and void ab initio.
     
Each Pledgor hereby irrevocably authorizes JPM at any time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction any initial financing statements (including fixture filings) with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof and amendments thereto that contain the information required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any financing statement or amendment, including (i) whether such Pledgor is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification number issued to such Pledgor, (ii) in the case of a financing statement filed as a fixture filing, a sufficient description of the real property to which such Collateral relates and (iii) a description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner as JPM may reasonably determine is necessary or advisable to ensure the perfection of the security interest in th e Collateral granted under this Agreement, including describing such property as "all assets" or "all property". Each Pledgor agrees to provide such information to JPM promptly upon request.
     
JPM is further authorized to file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office (or any successor office or any similar office in any other country) such documents as may be reasonably necessary or advisable for the purpose of perfecting, confirming, continuing, enforcing or protecting the Security Interest granted by each Pledgor, without the signature of such Pledgor, and naming such Pledgor or the Pledgors as debtors and JPM as secured party.
     
(b) The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not subject JPM to, or in any way alter or modify, any obligation or liability of any Pledgor with respect to or arising out of the Collateral.
     
Section 4.02.

person other than any consent or approval that has been obtained and is in full force and effect or has otherwise been disclosed herein or in the Merger Agreement.
     
(b) The Security Interest constitutes (i) a legal and valid security interest in all the Collateral securing the payment and performance of the Obligations, (ii) subject to appropriate filings in the relevant jurisdictions, a perfected security interest in all Collateral (other than Commercial Tort Claims) in which a security interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registering a financing statement in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) and its territories and possessions pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code.
     
Section 4.03.
Covenants
. (a) Each Pledgor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as JPM may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including, without limitation, the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any financing statements (including fixture filings) or other documents in connection herewith or therewith, all in accordance with the terms hereof.

Schedule III
or adding additional schedules hereto to specifically identify any asset or item that may constitute material Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, Copyright Licenses, Patent Licenses or Trademark Licenses
; provided
that any Pledgor shall have the right, exercisable within 30 days after BSC has been notified by JPM of the specific identification of such Collateral, to advise JPM in writing of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties ma de by such Pledgor hereunder with respect to such Collateral. Each Pledgor agrees that, upon JPM's request, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as shall be necessary in order that all representations and warranties hereunder shall be true and correct with respect to such Collateral within 90 days after the date it has been notified by JPM of the specific identification of such Collateral.
     
(b) JPM shall have the right to verify the validity, amount, quality, quantity, value, condition and status of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral, including, in the case of Accounts or Collateral in the possession of any third person, by contacting Account Debtors or the third person possessing such Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification.
     
(c) At its option, JPM may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not a Permitted Lien, and may pay for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral to the extent any Pledgor fails to do so as required by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, and each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse JPM on demand for any reasonable payment made or any reasonable expense incurred by JPM pursuant to the foregoing authorization
; provided, however
, that nothing in this Section 4.03(d) shall be interpreted as excusing any Pledgor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on JPM to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any Pl edgor with respect to taxes, assessments,
charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein.
     
(d) Each Pledgor (rather than JPM) shall remain liable for the observance and performance of all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral and each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless JPM from and against any and all liability for such performance.
     
(e) None of the Pledgors shall make or permit to be made an assignment, pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral or shall grant any other Lien in respect of the Collateral, except as permitted by the Merger Agreement or Section 7.18 hereof. None of the Pledgors shall make or permit to be made any transfer of the Collateral and each Pledgor shall remain at all times in possession of the Collateral owned by it, except as permitted by the Merger Agreement or Section 7.18 hereof.
     
(f) Each Pledgor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints JPM (and all officers, employees or agents designated by JPM) as such Pledgor's true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact) for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Pledgor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto.
     
(g) Other than as permitted under the Merger Agreement or Section 7.18 hereof, the Pledgors shall not create, incur, assume or permit to exist any lien on any property or assets (including stock or other securities of any person, including any Subsidiary) at the time owned by them or on any income or revenues or rights in respect of any thereof.
     
Section 4.04.
Collateral Held by JPM
. For the avoidance of doubt and not in limitation of the rights of JPM under Sections 9-104(a)(1), 9-106(a) and 8-106(e) of the New York UCC, the Pledgors and JPM (acting as a bank with respect to any deposit accounts (the "JPM Accounts") and as a securities intermediary with respect to any securities accounts (the "JPM Securities Accounts"), in either case maintained at or with JPM or any of its Affiliates), acknowledge and agree with respect thereto, that JPM, as the secured party hereunder, may issue instructions to direct disposition of any and all of the funds in the JPM Accounts (and acting as the bank will comply with such instructions) and may issue entitlement orders with respect to any and all J PM Securities Accounts (and acting as the securities intermediary will comply with such entitlement orders), in each case, without the consent of any Pledgor.
     
Section 4.05.
Other Actions
. In order to further ensure the attachment, perfection and priority of, and the ability of JPM to enforce JPM's security interest in the Collateral, each Pledgor agrees, in each case at such Pledgor's own expense, to take the following actions:
     
(a)
Investment Property
. Upon JPM's request, any Pledgor shall deliver any Certificated Security included in the Pledged Securities then in such Pledgor's possession, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as JPM may
from time to time reasonably specify. If any security of a domestic issuer now owned or hereafter acquired by any Pledgor is uncertificated and is issued to such Pledgor or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, (i) upon JPM's reasonable request or (ii) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Trigger Event, each Pledgor shall pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to JPM, either cause the issuer to agree to comply with instructions from JPM as to such security, without further consent of any Pledgor or such nominee, or cause the issuer to register JPM as the registered owner of such security.
     
(b)
Financial Intermediaries
. If requested by JPM, Pledgors shall instruct third-party financial intermediaries in possession of any Collateral, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such financial intermediaries to enter into control and other agreements, as necessary and appropriate to effectuate and perfect the liens contemplated hereby.
     
(c)
Commercial Tort Claims
. Upon the request of JPM from time to time, Pledgors shall notify JPM of any Commercial Tort Claim in an amount reasonably estimated to exceed $50.0 million then held by such Pledgor, and shall provide a summary description of such claim, and grant to JPM in writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all under the terms and provisions of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to JPM.
     
(d)
Foreign Collateral
. Execute such further documents and take such further actions as JPM may reasonably request under local law to establish the guaranties contemplated herein and create and perfect liens and security interests in the portion of the Collateral located in (or held by entities located or organized in) jurisdictions outside the United States.
     
(e)
Deposit Accounts/Securities Accounts
. If requested by JPM, move any and all Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts of any Pledgor held at a third party depository institution to JPM or an affiliate of JPM;

(f)
Real Property
. Execute, deliver, file and otherwise cause to become effective mortgages, assignments and other agreements in appropriate form with respect to real property fee and leasehold interests, in each case to the extent requested by JPM unless such action would violate in any material respect a legal (including regulatory) or enforceable contractual prohibition or obligation binding on the applicable Pledgor that would give rise to a loss (including without limitation a termination of a benefit) or liability that is material to BSC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
     
(g)
General

request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to JPM as to the perfection and priority of the liens created or intended to be created hereunder.
     
Section 5.01.
Remedies Upon Default
. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event and until the satisfaction of the Obligation giving rise to the Trigger Event and any other then-due Obligations, each Pledgor agrees to deliver on demand each item of Collateral to JPM, and it is agreed that JPM shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Collateral by the applicable Pledgors to JPM or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis, any such Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as JPM shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers thereunder cannot be obtained with the use of commercially reasonable efforts, which each Pledgor hereby agrees to use) and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to the applicable Pledgor to enter any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Pledgor agrees that JPM shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any b roker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as JPM shall deem appropriate.

Upon consummation of any such sale of Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.01, JPM shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives and releases (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal that such Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
     
JPM shall give the applicable Pledgors 10 Business Days' written notice (which each Pledgor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of JPM's intention to make any sale of Collateral (except where notice shall not be required under the New York UCC no notice shall be required). Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or
times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as JPM may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or the portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as JPM may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. JPM shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. JPM may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In the case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by JPM until the sal e price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but JPM shall not incur any liability in the event that any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in the case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon notice given in accordance with provisions above. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 5.01, JPM may bid for or purchase for cash, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Pledgor (all such rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and JPM may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property in accordance with Section 5.02 hereof without further accountability to any Pledgor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be t reated as a sale thereof; JPM shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Pledgor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after JPM shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, JPM may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
Section 5.02.
Apportionment, Application, and Reversal of Payments
.
     
(a) All payments received by JPM for application to the Obligations shall be applied to such Obligations in such manner as JPM shall determine in its sole discretion.
     
(b) JPM shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by JPM (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by JPM or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to JPM or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
     
(c) If, after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of any Obligations, JPM is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible set-off, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by JPM and each Pledgor shall be liable to pay to JPM, and shall indemnify JPM and holds JPM harmless for the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The provisions of this Section 5.02(c) shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by JPM in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to JPM's rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 5.02(d) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
     
Section 5.03.
Securities Act, Etc.
Each Pledgor understands that compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar federal statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "
Federal Securities Laws
") might limit the course of conduct of JPM if JPM were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Securities could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting JPM in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Securities under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, JPM, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws or, to the extent applicable, Blue Sky or other state securities laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, JPM shall not incur any responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of t he Pledged Securities at a price that JPM, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section 5.03 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which JPM sells.
     
Section 6.01.
Indemnity
. In addition to all such rights of indemnity, reimbursement, contribution and subrogation as JPM or the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject, in the case of the Guarantors, to Section 6.03 hereof), the Primary Obligor with respect to each Underlying Liability agrees that (a) such Primary Obligor is primarily liable with respect to such Underlying Liability and shall pay such Underlying Liability when due and promptly reimburse JPM in respect of any payment by JPM under any Guaranty in respect of such Underlying Liability, and (b) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement in respect of any Obligation arising from the satisfaction of an Underlying Liability, the applicable Primary Obligor, if any, shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment.
     
Section 6.02.
Contribution and Subrogation
. Each Guarantor (a "
Contributing
Guarantor
") agrees (subject to Section 6.03 hereof) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Obligation arising from the satisfaction of any Underlying Liability of an applicable Primary Obligor or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy any Obligation arising from the satisfaction of any Underlying L iability of an applicable Primary Obligor and such other Guarantor (the "
Claiming
Guarantor
") shall not have been fully indemnified by such Primary Obligor, as provided in Section 6.01 hereof, the Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as applicable, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of such Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 7.16 hereof, the date of the sup plement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section 6.01 hereof to the extent of such payment.
     
Section 6.03.
Subordination; Subrogation
. (a) Each Guarantor hereby subordinates any and all debts, liabilities and other obligations owed to such Guarantor by each other Guarantor and by each other Affiliate of BSC (the "
Subordinated Obligations
") to the Obligations to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Section 6.03:
     
(i)
Prohibited Payments, Etc
. Each Guarantor may receive payments from any other Guarantor on account of the Subordinated Obligations.

(ii)
Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations
. In any proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law relating to any other Guarantor, each
Guarantor agrees that JPM shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations (including all interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under any U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law, whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding ("
Post-Petition
Interest
")) before such Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations.
     
(iii)
Turn-Over
. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Trigger Event, each Guarantor shall, if JPM so requests, collect, enforce and receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations and deliver such payments to JPM on account of the Obligations (including all Post-Petition Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Agreement.
     
(iv)
Collateral Agent Authorization
. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Trigger Event, JPM is authorized and empowered (but without any obligation to so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name of each Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, the Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to the Obligations (including any and all Post-Petition Interest), and (ii) to require each Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, the Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to JPM for application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post-Petition Interest).
     
(b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against each Primary Obligor, any other Guarantor or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of the guarantee set forth in Article II hereof, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of JPM against the any Primary Obligor, any other Guarantor or any other insider guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Primary Obligor, any other Guarantor or any other insider guarantor, directly or i ndirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Obligations all other amounts payable under the guarantee set forth in Article II and all of the Underlying Liabilities shall have been paid in full in cash and JPM has no further actual or contingent liabilities under any Guaranty or to a creditor of any Covered BSC Entity in respect of any Underlying Liability.
