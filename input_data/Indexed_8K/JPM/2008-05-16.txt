provided
(i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Stock, rights to acquire Common Stock, and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as a Replacement Capital Security, if after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Stock, rights to acquire Common Stock and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as a Replacement Capital Security would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated for financial reporting purposes;
(ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt; or

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Qualifying Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Qualifying Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy clause (ii) of the definition of Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
(d) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
