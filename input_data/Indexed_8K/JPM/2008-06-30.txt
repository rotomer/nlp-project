(this "Guarantee")
, is made by JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., a Delaware corporation and multi-bank financial holding company headquartered in New York, New York
("Guarantor")
.
WHEREAS, Guarantor has agreed at the request of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., a Delaware corporation
                  
("Obligor")
, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, to guarantee the payment of all liabilities and obligations of Obligor in its capacity as issuer of the securities
(the "Instruments", and each such liability or obligation, an "Obligation")
issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2006 (
as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Indenture"
), between Obligor and The Bank of New York, as trustee (
the "Trustee")
, such Guarantee to be for the benefit of each holder from time to time of an Instrument
(all such holders, collectively, the "Beneficiaries")
;
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
                   
Schedule 1
              Capitalized terms used in this Schedule and not otherwise defined herein or in the Appendix A to which this Schedule is attached have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
Section 1:
Agreement to Subordinate
Guarantor, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Beneficiary likewise covenants and agrees by his or her acceptance of the Guarantee, that the obligation of Guarantor to make any payment on account of principal (and premium, if any) and interest pursuant to the Guarantee shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to Guarantor's obligations to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
              
In the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of or relating to Guarantor as a whole, whether voluntary or involuntary, all obligations of Guarantor to holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to be paid in full before any payment, whether in cash, property or otherwise, shall be made on any account of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest pursuant to the Guarantee. In the event of any such proceeding, after payment in full of all sums owing with respect to Senior Indebtedness, the Beneficiaries, together with the holders of Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Guarantee, shall be entitl ed ratably to be paid from the remaining assets of Guarantor the amounts at the time due and owing on account of unpaid principal (and premium, if any) and interest pursuant to the Guarantee before any payment or other distribution, whether in cash, property or otherwise, shall be made on account of any Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Guarantee or any capital stock. In addition, in the event of any such proceeding, if any payment or distribution of assets of Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of Guarantor or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in these subordination provisions with respect to the Guarantee, to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness at the time outstanding and to any securities issued in respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or readjustment), including any such payment or distribution that may be paya ble or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of Guarantor being subordinated to the payment of the obligations under the Guarantee, shall be received by the Trustee or the Beneficiaries before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, such payment or distribution shall be held (in trust if received by such Beneficiaries) for the benefit of and shall be paid over to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee or custodian for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
              
The subordination provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not be applicable to amounts at the time due and owing on the Guarantee for the payment of which funds have been deposited in trust with the Trustee or any Paying Agent or have been set aside by Guarantor or Obligor in trust in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; nor shall such provisions impair any rights, interests, remedies or powers of any secured creditor of Guarantor in respect of any security the creation of which is not prohibited by the provisions of the Indenture.
              
The Beneficiaries and the Trustee, in respect of any claims of such Beneficiaries to payment under the Guarantee, by their acceptance of the Guarantee will be deemed to have waived any right of set-
              
off or counterclaim that such Beneficiaries or (subject to Section 6.7 of the Indenture) the Trustee, respectively, in such respect, might otherwise have.
              
The securing of any Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Guarantee or Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Guarantee shall not be deemed to prevent such Indebtedness from constituting Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Guarantee or Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Guarantee, respectively. The securing of any Indebtedness for Money Borrowed of Guarantor otherwise constituting Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Guarantee shall not be deemed to prevent such Indebtedness for Money Borrowed from constituting Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Guarantee. The securing of any Indebtedness for Money Borrowed of Guarantor otherwise constituting Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Guarantee shall not be deemed to prevent such Indebtedness for Money Borrowed from con stituting Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Guarantee.
              
Guarantor shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or relating to Guarantor as a whole, whether voluntary or involuntary, or of any default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness that would prevent the Trustee from making any payment in respect of the Guarantee under this Section. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 of the Indenture, shall be entitled to assume that, and may act as if, no such event has occurred unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee assigned to the Corporate Trust Office has received at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee f rom Guarantor or any one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or any trustee therefor (who shall have been certified or otherwise established to the satisfaction of the Trustee to be such a holder or trustee) written notice thereof. Upon any distribution of assets of Guarantor referred to in this Schedule 1, the Trustee and Beneficiaries shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent, or any order or decree entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Beneficiaries for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Schedule 1, and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article 6 of the Indenture, and the Beneficiaries shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate of the liquidatin g trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Beneficiaries for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent to this Schedule 1. In the absence of any such liquidating trustee, agent or other Person, the Trustee, subject to Section 6.1 of the Indenture, shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon a written notice by a Person representing himself or herself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) as evidence that such Person is a holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or is such a trustee or representative). In the event that the Trustee determines, in its discretion, that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person, as a holder of Senior Indebtedness, to participate in any payment or d istribution pursuant to this Schedule 1, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Schedule 1, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
Section 2:
Obligation of Guarantor Unconditional and Payment Permitted if no Default
              
Subject to the provisions of this Schedule 1 and the terms of the Instruments, nothing contained in this Schedule 1 or elsewhere in the Indenture is intended to or shall impair, as between Guarantor and the
Beneficiaries, the obligation of Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay such Beneficiaries amounts owing pursuant to the Guarantee, all in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of such Beneficiaries and creditors of Guarantor other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or any Beneficiary from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Schedule 1 of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of Guarantor received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
Section 3:
Limitations on Duties to Beneficiaries of Senior Indebtedness
              
In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Senior Indebtedness beyond any applicable period of grace, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing, or would occur as a result of the payment referred to hereinafter, permitting the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to accelerate the maturity thereof, then, unless and until such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest, if any, on the Guarantee, or in respect of any redemption, exchange, retirement, purchase or other a cquisition of any of the Instruments, shall be made by Guarantor.
Section 4:
Notice to Trustee of Facts Prohibiting Payments
              
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Schedule 1 or any other provision of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of funds to or by the Trustee unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee assigned to its Corporate Trust Division shall have received at the Corporate Trust Office written notice thereof from Guarantor or from one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor who shall have been certified by Guarantor or otherwise established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee to be such a holder or trustee; and, prior to the receipt of such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 of the Indent ure, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist;
provided
,
however
, that if prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the date upon which by the terms hereof any such funds may become payable, or if prior to the third Business Day preceding the date of the execution of instruments pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Indenture acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not have received with respect to such funds the notice provided for in this Section 4, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and/or apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it on or after such date;
provided
,
however
, no such application shall affect the obligations under this Schedule 1 of the Persons receiving such moneys from the Trustee.
Section 5:
Application by Trustee of Moneys Deposited With It
              
Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any deposit of a sum by Guarantor with the Trustee or any agent (whether or not in trust) for any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest pursuant to the Guarantee shall, except as provided in Section 4 above, be subject to the provisions of Section 1 above.
Section 6:
Subrogation
              
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Beneficiaries shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of
Guarantor applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the Instruments shall be paid in full, and none of the payments or distributions to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to which the Beneficiaries or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Schedule 1 or of payments over, pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule 1, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness by the Beneficiaries or the Trustee shall, as among Guarantor, its creditors other than the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, and the Beneficiaries, be deemed to be a payment by Guarantor to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness; it being understood that the provisions of this Schedule 1 are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Beneficiaries, on one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
Section 7:
Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of Bank or Beneficiaries of Senior
Indebtedness
              
No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by Guarantor with the terms, provisions and covenants of the Guarantee (including this Schedule 1), regardless of any knowledge thereof with which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged. The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time or from time to time and in their absolute discretion, change the manner, place or terms of payment, change or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any such Senior Indebtedness, or amend or supplement any instrumen t pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness is issued or by which it may be secured, or release any security therefor, or exercise or refrain from exercising any other of their rights under the Senior Indebtedness including, without limitation, the waiver of default thereunder, all without notice to or assent from the Beneficiaries or the Trustee and without affecting the obligations of Guarantor, the Trustee or the Beneficiaries under this Schedule 1.
Section 8:
Authorization of Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of Securities

The term "Trustee" as used in this Schedule 1 shall (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including each Paying Agent appointed by the Obligor and acting hereunder within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if the Paying Agent were named in this Schedule 1 in addition to or in place of the Trustee;
provided
,

JPMorgan Chase Announces Internal Restructuring Transactions and Guarantees Related to Bear Stearns Acquisition
New York, June 30, 2008  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(NYSE: JPM) announced today that it intends to take several steps over the next several weeks related to the integration of the businesses of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. that will result in the assumption of Bear Stearns' preferred stock and debt securities by JPMorgan Chase and the termination of Bear Stearns' reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
As previously announced, JPMorgan Chase expects to complete on July 15, 2008 an internal merger transaction, as a result of which each series of outstanding preferred stock of Bear Stearns will be automatically converted into a series of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock having substantially identical terms. Following the completion of this transaction, depositary shares, each representing a one-fourth interest in a share of Bear Stearns preferred stock, will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, but will instead represent a one-fourth interest in a share of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock and will trade under a new symbol and CUSIP number.
Following completion of this transaction, Bear Stearns plans to transfer its broker-dealer subsidiary Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to JPMorgan Chase, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of Bear Stearns' assets to JPMorgan Chase. In connection with such transfer, JPMorgan Chase will assume (1) all of Bear Stearns' then-outstanding registered U.S. debt securities; (2) Bear Stearns' obligations relating to trust preferred securities; (3) Bear Stearns' then-outstanding foreign debt securities; and (4) Bear Stearns' guarantees of then-outstanding foreign debt securities issued by subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, in each case, in accordance with the agreements and indentures governing these securities.
Pending completion of the above transactions, effective June 30, 2008, JPMorgan Chase has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each series of outstanding preferred stock of Bear Stearns, as well as all of Bear Stearns' outstanding registered U.S. debt securities and obligations relating to trust preferred securities. As a result of these guarantees, Bear Stearns will cease to separately file current and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act.
