Item 8.01  Other Events
JPMorgan Chase & Co. disclosed today that it held approximately $1.2 billion par value of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac perpetual preferred stock. Such securities are held in the Firm's investment portfolio and are marked to market through the Firm's earnings. The Firm estimates that such preferred stocks have declined in value by approximately an aggregate $600 million in the third quarter to date, based on current market values. The precise amount of losses that may be incurred on these securities for the third quarter is difficult to determine, given the significant volatility being experienced in the market values of these securities.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: August 25, 2008
