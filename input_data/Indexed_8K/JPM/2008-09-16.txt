1. . The series of preferred stock shall be designated as the "8.625% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series J" (the "Series J Preferred Stock"). The Series J Preferred Stock shall be perpetual, subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, and the authorized number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall be $1,800,000,000 (180,000) shares. The Series J Preferred Stock is issuable in whole shares only.
Designation and Amount; Fractional Shares
2. .
Dividends
(a) Holders of Series J Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $10,000 per share of Series J Preferred Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (each such day on which dividends are payable a "").
Dividend Payment Date
In the event that any Dividend Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the dividend payment due on that date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. The period from and including any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a "", provided that the initial Dividend Period shall be the period from and including the original issue date of the Series J Preferred Stock to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends on each share of Series J Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of $10,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 8.625%, for each Dividend Period.
Dividend Period
Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of Series J Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on such record date, not more than 30 days preceding the payment date thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The amount of dividends payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
A "" shall mean any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed.
Business Day
(b) Dividends on shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series J Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series J Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series J Preferred Stock.
(c) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the preferred stock of any series ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series J Preferred Stock for any period unless full dividends on the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock for the most recently completed Dividend Period have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart for such payment). When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series J Preferred Stock, all dividends declared and paid upon shares of the Series J Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series J Preferred Stock shall be declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, the Corporation shall allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividend payments due on shares of Series J Preferred Stock and the aggregate of the current and accrued dividends due on any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series J Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall not pay interest or any sum of money instead of interest on any dividend payment that may be in arrears on the Series J Preferred Stock.
 
(d) So long as any shares of the Series J Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other stock ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and other than as provided in the paragraph directly above) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the common stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, nor shall any common stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), unless, in each case, full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series J Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment in respect of the most recently completed Dividend Period.
3. . (a) Upon the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the common stock or on any other class of stock ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $10,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends on each such share without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
Liquidation Preference
(b) After the payment to the holders of the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 3, the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
(c) If, upon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Corporation, the amounts payable with respect to the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock and any other shares of stock of the Corporation ranking as to any such distribution on a parity with the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock and of such other shares shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are entitled.
(d) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property or business of the Corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other entity or the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 3.

The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest.
