Item 8.01 Other Events
JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase") is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K ("Form 8-K") to supplement financial disclosures included in JPMorgan Chase's previously filed reports to reflect recently announced changes in JPMorgan Chase's business segments. This information provides a bridge between how the business segment results were presented in previously filed reports and how those results would now look had such results been reported to reflect the manner in which JPMorgan Chase's business segments are now being managed. The recasting of the previously issued financial information does not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements and does not affect the Firm's reported net income, earnings per share, total assets or regulatory capital for any of the previously reported periods. The recast financial Information presented herein should be read in conjunction with previously filed reports. A summary of the revisions follows.
Business Segment Changes
Previously, Retail Financial Services ("RFS") consisted of three reporting segments: Regional Banking, Mortgage Banking and Auto Finance. Commencing October 1, 2008, RFS was reorganized into the following two reporting segments: Retail Banking and Consumer Lending. The new Retail Banking reporting segment now comprises branch banking and business banking activities, which previously were reported in Regional Banking. The new Consumer Lending reporting segment now comprises: (a) the prior Mortgage Banking and Auto Finance reporting segments, (b) the home equity, education and other lending business activities which were previously reported in the Regional Banking reporting segment and (c) loan activity related to prime mortgages that were originated by RFS, but reported in the Corporate/Private Equity business segment. All periods presented reflect this basis.
Washington Mutual transaction
As reported in previous filings, on September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank ("Washington Mutual") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") for $1.9 billion through a purchase of substantially all of the assets and assumption of specified liabilities of Washington Mutual. The financial information contained in Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K has been recast from how this information was previously presented to reflect the allocation of the September 30, 2008, end of period balance sheet amounts of the acquired assets and liabilities to the appropriate lines of business, primarily RFS, Card Services and Commercial Banking business segments, as well as to Corporate/Private Equity.
The financial information included in Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into filings of JPMorgan Chase under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Commencing October 1, 2008, JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMC" or the "Firm") revised certain of its financial disclosures to reflect more closely the manner in which its business segments are now being managed. The revisions are reflected in the Firm's financial reports and disclosures commencing with its report of financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008.
In summary, the changes that have been made in financial reporting disclosure are as follows:
1. RFS has been reorganized, commencing October 1, 2008, into the following two business segments: Retail Banking and Consumer Lending. The chart on the following page provides a mapping of the previous segment reporting to the new RFS segments.
Retail Financial Services ("RFS")
2. Prime mortgage balances that were originated in RFS and, prior to October 1, 2008, had been held in the Corporate/Private Equity segment have been transferred, effective October 1, 2008, to RFS and are included, for financial reporting and risk management purposes, in the Consumer Lending segment of RFS.
Corporate/Private Equity & RFS
3. As previously disclosed, the acquisition of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank ("WaMu") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on September 25, 2008, did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the Firm for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, except with respect to the charge to conform WaMu's loan loss reserves and the extraordinary gain related to the transaction, both of which were reflected in the Corporate/Private Equity segment. Commencing October 1, 2008, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from WaMu were assigned to the appropriate lines of business, primarily RFS, Card Services and Commercial Banking, as well as to the Corporate/Private Equity segment. The results of operations resulting from such assets and liabilities have been reflected in each respective line of business starting in the fourth quarter of 2008. Disclosures related to these assets and liabilities have been enhanced as follows:
Washington Mutual
the Consumer Lending loan balance and other balance-related credit data has been enhanced to provide detail on credit-impaired versus non-credit impaired balances.
RFS
Managed loan balances and selected key statistics for WaMu and heritage JPMorgan Chase-only are provided as supplemental information.
Card Services
Commercial Term Lending has been added as a client segment and includes WaMu's multi-family and commercial mortgage business. All other WaMu-related commercial bank activities are reported in the Real Estate Banking or Other segments of Commercial Banking.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
(in millions, except per share, ratio and headcount data)
(a)  The Firm adopted SFAS 157 in the first quarter of 2007. For additional information, see Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report
(b)  Includes accounting conformity loan loss reserve provision related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank's banking operations.
(c)  On October 1, 2006, the Firm completed the exchange of selected corporate trust businesses for the consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank of New York. The results of operations of these corporate trust businesses are reported as discontinued operations for 2006.
(d)  JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank for $1.9 billion. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale were written down against that negative goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain.
(e)  On September 30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5 billion, or 284 million shares, of its common stock at $40.50 per share.
(f)   Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.
(g)  Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm. The Firm also utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors.
(h)  Income from continuing operations divided by total average assets less average assets of discontinued operations held-for-sale.
(i)   Increases in the third quarter and second quarter of 2008 predominantly relate to the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank's banking operations and Bear Stearns & Co., respectively.
(j)   See Corporate/Private Equity Financial Highlights for additional details.
(k)  Common equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008, as the effect would be antidilutive.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED SUMMARY
(in millions)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). That presentation, which is referred to as "reported basis," provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financial statements.
In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's and the lines' of business results on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications that assume credit card loans securitized by Card Services remain on the balance sheet and presents revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. These adjustments do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole. The impact of these adjustments are summarized below. For additional information about managed basis, please refer to the Glossary of Terms on page 37.

TSS firmwide metrics include revenue recorded in the CB, Retail Banking and Asset Management ("AM") lines of business and excludes FX revenue recorded in the IB for TSS-related FX activity. In order to capture the firmwide impact of Treasury Services ("TS") and TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary in order to understand the aggregate TSS business.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Glossary of Terms
Automated Clearing House.
ACH:
Refers to total assets on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets plus credit card receivables that have been securitized.
Average managed assets:
Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt/equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase & Co. consolidates under FIN 46R. The underlying obligations of the VIEs consist of short-term borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt. The related assets consist of trading assets, available-for-sale securities, loans and other assets.
Beneficial interest issued by consolidated VIEs:
In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy, whichever is earlier.
Contractual credit card charge-off:
Includes Private Equity, Treasury and Corporate Other, which includes other centrally managed expense and discontinued operations.
Corporate/Private Equity:
Card Services' managed results excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. Through securitization, the Firm transforms a portion of its credit card receivables into securities, which are sold to investors. The credit card receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets through the transfer of the receivables to a trust and the sale of undivided interests to investors that entitle the investors to specific cash flows generated from the credit card receivables. The Firm retains the remaining undivided interests as seller's interests, which are recorded in loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A gain or loss on the sale of credit card receivables to investors is recorded in other income. Securitization also affects the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income as the aggregate amount of interest income, certain fee revenue and recoveries that is in excess of the aggregate amount of interest paid to the investors, gross credit losses and other trust expense related to the securitized receivables are reclassified into credit card income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Credit card securitizations:
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51."
FIN 46(R):
An indication of credit quality based upon JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s internal risk assessment system. "Investment-grade" generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a "BBB-"/"Baa3" or better, as defined by independent rating agencies.
Investment-grade:
A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications related to credit card securitizations and to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.
Managed basis:
Refers to credit card receivables on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets plus credit card receivables that have been securitized.
Managed credit card receivables:
A measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the mark-to-market value is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes JPMorgan Chase & Co. and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Firm. When the mark-to-market value is negative, JPMorgan Chase & Co. owes the counterparty. In this situation, the Firm does not have repayment risk.
Mark-to-market exposure:
Reflects costs associated with the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers in 2008, costs associated with The Bank of New York, Inc. transaction ("The Bank of New York") in 2007, and costs associated with the 2004 merger with Bank One Corporation.
Merger costs:
Includes changes in MSR asset fair value due to inputs or assumptions in model and derivative valuation adjustments and other.
MSR risk management revenue:
The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.
Net yield on interest-earning assets:
Not meaningful.
NM:
Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.
Overhead ratio:
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodities inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value) and changes in fair value associated with financial instruments held by the Investment Bank for which the SFAS 159 fair value option was elected. Principal transactions revenue also include private equity gains and losses.
Principal transactions (revenue):
Financial statements prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The reported basis includes the impact of credit card securitizations, but excludes the impact of taxable equivalent adjustments.
Reported basis:
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards.
SFAS:
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125."
SFAS 140:
"Business Combinations."
SFAS 141:
"Fair Value Measurements."
SFAS 157:
"The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115."
SFAS 159:
"Accounting for Certain Loans of Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer."
SOP 03-3:
Total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to fully taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
Taxable-equivalent basis:
Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.
Unaudited:
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
U.S. GAAP:
A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.
Value-at-risk ("VAR"):
