Exhibit 99.1
News release: IMMEDIATE
New York, May 7, 2009  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed today that it has completed the U.S. Government's Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), which determined that JPMorgan Chase's capital position would remain strong under far more highly stressed conditions than exist today, and that there is no need for the company to raise additional capital at this time.
JPMorgan Chase's existing strong capital base and loan-loss reserves, together with its significant pretax, pre-provision earnings power, would enable it to weather adverse scenarios envisioned by SCAP, while still maintaining very strong capital ratios. JPMC's ratios under SCAP would remain very strong even when excluding TARP preferred stock. Importantly, the company believes it could handle a substantially worse environment than the Government's adverse conditions, even though the company is not expecting such a scenario.
Specifically, JPMorgan Chase's Tier 1 Capital Ratio is 11.4%  or 9.3% excluding TARP  as of March 31, 2009. The company's Tier 1 Common Ratio is 7.3% as of March 31, 2009, which is well in excess of the Government's 4.0% buffer level, and would remain so even under more highly adverse scenarios.
 
 
Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "JPMorgan Chase has worked hard to maintain its fortress balance sheet and strong capital position in this challenging environment." He added, "We are committed to supporting healthy economic growth and to doing our part to help our country through these tough times. In particular, we remain committed to safe and sound lending and to being a responsible corporate citizen. In the first quarter of this year alone, JPMorgan Chase lent more than $150 billion to consumers, small businesses, non-profits, municipalities, corporations and others."
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.1 trillion and operations in more than 60 countries. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers, small business and commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity.

Explanations Explanations of of JPM JPM Likely Likely Outcome Outcome
Primary difference is expense reductions. Assumes $3B loan loss reserve build
Multiple JPM stress scenarios currently suggest maximum losses of $5-6B for trading and $1-2B for private equity positions; JPM outcome does not relate to SCAP scenario
JPM has no intent to sell positions; no writedowns are expected
True-ups represent actual 1Q09 results
JPM believes it will be profitable under More Adverse scenario
No drastic measures assumed by JPM to reduce expense or discretionary investments
No gains on securities portfolio or business sales nor other extraordinary items
Even in a case worse than More Adverse scenario, JPM believes a loss over 2 years is unlikely because of incremental actions that could be taken

FICO scores
LTV levels
Historical peak loss rates
Historical performance by risk rating
Forecasted HPI by market
Credit quality migration: NPL rates, roll rates
Geographic and industry concentrations
Collateral levels
Purchase accounting adjustment represents losses on WaMu credit-impaired loans written down at the time of acquisition

Summary
More Adverse scenario is a conservative stress test for a worse than expected environment
JPM's existing strong capital and loan loss reserves together with extremely strong earnings power allow us to weather the SCAP stress test with no additional capital required
We can handle a substantially worse environment though we are not expecting it
In all cases we have the capital and intention to support an economic recovery by serving our clients needs, including credit
Subject to safe and sound lending practices
We remain very confident in the future prospects of our company
