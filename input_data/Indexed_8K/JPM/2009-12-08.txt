JPM continues to support, serve and empower consumers and small businesses
Overdraft on debit card transactions will be eliminated unless the NSF/OD changes customer "opts-in" (chooses to participate). Other changes to the policy include:
Modified posting order to recognize debit-card transactions and ATM withdrawals as they occur
No overdraft fees if a customer's account is $5 or less overdrawn
Reduced the maximum number of overdraft fees per day to 3 from 6
Blueprint
Helps customers manage their finances on their terms
Ability to avoid interest on everyday purchases, create a custom plan to pay off a large purchase, build a plan to pay down their card balance, and keep an eye on spending
Small business lending
Increase small business lending by $4B in 2010
Announced plans to add 325 additional small business bankers
The $4B lending commitment should boost expected new lending to ~$10B

Outlook  Retail Financial Services
4Q09
Solid underlying growth
Average deposit balances to decline $10B +/- QoQ  past the peak of Wamu CD balance run-off (total WaMu CD balance run-off of $11.5B)
Delinquencies and roll rates show some stability
Home Lending losses flat to 3Q09 actuals
Non-compensation expense modestly up QoQ reflecting an increase in foreclosed asset expense
2010
NSF/OD policy changes currently estimated to reduce annualized after-tax income by $500mm +/-
At current production and estimated run-off levels, the Home Lending portfolio of $274B at 3Q09 could decline by 10-15%, possibly to $240B +/- in 2010 and $200B +/- in 2011
The preliminary estimate will reduce 2010 net interest income in the home lending portfolio by
$1B +/- from estimated FY2009 levels
Credit environment remains uncertain
Signs of stability  improvement
Home Lending quarterly loss guidance is unchanged
Expense remains at or above 2009 levels, reflecting
Investments in branch new builds and sales force hires
Continued elevated servicing and default expense, including foreclosed asset expense

Outlook  Card Services
4Q09
Chase and WaMu losses of 9% +/- and 22% +/-, respectively
Average outstandings expected to be $6B lower QoQ driven by continued run-off of WaMu portfolio and higher payment levels
2010
Chase losses could approach 11% by 1Q10 including the adverse timing effect of payment holiday of 60bps
WaMu losses could approach 24% +/- over the next several quarters
Anticipate net income reduction from legislative changes of $500-$750mm
Expect estimated full year average outstandings for 2009 of $170B +/- to decline $15B +/- to $155B +/- in 2010 due to WaMu portfolio run-off of $7B +/- and lower balance transfer levels
Expect $1B +/- net loss per quarter in 1H10, before potential reserve actions; 2H10 dependent on the environment and reserve actions
Continue to invest in the business

2.All non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation are provided to assist readers in understanding certain trend information.
Additional information concerning such non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the above-referenced filings, to which reference is hereby made.
3.The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired loans; the allowance for loan losses related to purchased credit-impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates exclude the impact of purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance related to the purchased credit-impaired portfolio was $1.1 billion at September 30, 2009.
4.Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is calculated, for all purposes, as Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries.
5.Tangible Common Equity ("TCE") is calculated, for all purposes, as common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The TCE measures used in this presentation are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other firms due to differences in calculation methodologies.
