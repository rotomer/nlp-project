News release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth-quarter 2009 net income of $3.3 billion, compared with net income of $702 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared with $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, net income was $11.7 billion, or $2.26 per share, up from $5.6 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2008.
New York, January 15, 2010
Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: "We gratified that we generated earnings of $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter and nearly $12 billion for the year. Though these results showed improvement, we acknowledge that they fell short of both an adequate return on capital and the firm's earnings potential. We benefited from the diversity of our leading franchises, as demonstrated by the continued earnings strength of our Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, Asset Management and Retail Banking franchises. We are proud that, throughout these tumultuous times, we never stopped investing in the fundamental growth drivers of our consumer businesses  such as checking and credit card accounts in our Retail Banking and
 
 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
Card Services franchises  and have developed new products and services to meet the needs of consumers and small businesses. While we are seeing some stability in delinquencies, consumer credit costs remain high, and weak employment and home prices persist. Accordingly, we remain cautious."
Commenting on the firm's balance sheet, Dimon added: "In the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our credit reserves to nearly $33 billion, or 5.5% of total loans. Our earnings generated additional capital, and we ended 2009 with a very strong Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.1% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.8%. We remain confident that this capital and reserve strength, combined with our significant earnings power, will allow us to meet the uncertainties that lie ahead and still continue investing in our businesses and serving our clients and shareholders over the long term."
Dimon further remarked: "We remain committed to helping homeowners meet the challenges of declining home prices and rising unemployment. Since 2007, we have initiated more than 900,000 actions to prevent foreclosures through our own programs and through government mortgage modification programs. During 2009 alone we offered approximately 600,000 new trial loan modifications to struggling homeowners. Of these, 89,000 loans have achieved permanent modification. By March 31, 2010, we will have opened 51 Chase Homeownership Centers across the country, and we already have more than 14,000 employees dedicated to mortgage loss mitigation."
Reflecting on the events of the previous year, Dimon concluded: "Throughout this period of financial turbulence, our employees have never lost focus on what a bank should do  support and serve our 90 million customers and the communities in which we operate; deliver consumer-friendly products and policies; and continue to lend. We extended nearly $250 billion in new credit to consumers during the year, and for our corporate and municipal clients, either lent or assisted them in raising approximately $1 trillion in loans, stocks or bonds. Lastly, I am very proud of our more than 200,000 employees around the world, from our programmers to our receptionists to our bankers. Through their tremendous efforts, we have been able to protect our company and keep it healthy and vibrant, while doing our part to support the global financial system and helping the countries where we do business."
In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 13.
The following discussion compares the fourth quarter of 2009 with the fourth quarter of 2008 unless otherwise noted.

INVESTMENT BANK (IB)
Discussion of Results:
Net income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion from the prior year. These results reflected significantly higher net revenue, a benefit from the provision for credit losses, and lower noninterest expense.
Net revenue was $4.9 billion, compared with negative $272 million in the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 38% to $1.9 billion, consisting of debt underwriting fees of $732 million (up 58%), advisory fees of $611 million (up 6%), and equity underwriting fees of $549 million (up 66%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, compared with negative $1.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting modest gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions, compared with markdowns of $2.9 billion in the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue declined from a record 2009 third quarter, primarily due to lower overall volumes and tighter spreads across products. Equity Markets revenue was $971 million, compared with negative $94 million in the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue across products and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio revenue was negative $669 million, reflecting the negative impact of credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, and mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by net interest income on loans.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $181 million, compared with an expense of $765 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower loan balances, driven by loan sales and repayments. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 8.25%, compared with 4.83% in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $685 million, compared with $87 million in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $3.5 billion, up by $2.3 billion from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion from the prior quarter.
Noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, down by $455 million, or 17%, from the prior year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and headcount-related expense.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES (RFS)
Discussion of Results:
Retail Financial Services reported a net loss of $399 million, compared with net income of $624 million in the prior year.
Net revenue was $7.7 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 12%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $5.1 billion, up by $360 million, or 8%, reflecting the impact of wider loan spreads and a shift to wider-spread deposit products, partially offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 35%, driven by lower MSR risk management results and an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans.
The provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, an increase of $653 million from the prior year and $241 million from the prior quarter. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines continued to drive higher estimated losses for the mortgage and home equity portfolios. The provision included an addition of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses, compared with additions of $1.9 billion in the prior year and $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. Included in the $1.5 billion addition to the allowance was a $491 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolio; this compared with no addition in the prior year and a $1.1 billion addition in the prior quarter related to the portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.2 billion (4.52% net charge-off rate), compared with $770 million (2.67% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $452 million (14.01% net charge-off rate), compared with $319 million (8.08% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $568 million (3.81% net charge-off rate), compared with $195 million (1.20% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.

reported net income of $1.0 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year.
Retail Banking
Net revenue was $4.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year, as an increase in net interest income was offset by a decrease in noninterest revenue. Net interest income benefited from a shift to wider-spread deposit products, largely offset by a decline in time deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by declining deposit-related fees and investment sales revenue, predominantly offset by an increase in debit card income.
 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
The provision for credit losses was $248 million, compared with $268 million in the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the Business Banking portfolio.
Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $41 million, or 2%, reflecting increased FDIC insurance premiums and headcount-related expense, offset by efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

reported a net loss of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss of $416 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense.
Consumer Lending
Net revenue was $3.1 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 24%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income and lower loan balances, partially offset by wider loan spreads. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower mortgage production revenue and lower net mortgage servicing revenue. Mortgage production revenue was negative $192 million, compared with positive $62 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans was largely offset by wider margins on new originations and the absence of markdowns of the mortgage warehouse in the prior year. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing revenue net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $564 million, up by $41 million. MSR risk management results were $109 million, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year. The provision reflected an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $1.5 billion in the current quarter, resulting in an allowance for loan losses to ending loans retained of 5.04%, compared with 3.16% in the prior year (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit losses, above, for further detail).

CARD SERVICES (CS)(*)
 
Discussion of Results:
Card Services reported a net loss of $306 million, compared with a net loss of $371 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses.
End-of-period managed loans were $163.4 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion, or 14%, from the prior year and a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 1%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans were $163.2 billion, a decrease of $24.1 billion, or 13%, from the prior year and a decrease of $6.0 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, end-of-period and average managed loans were $143.8 billion and $142.8 billion, respectively.
Managed net revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $240 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, down by $55 million, or 1%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower average managed loan balances, a decreased level of fees, the impact of legislative changes, and higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs, offset by wider loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $885 million, an increase of $295 million, or 50%, from the prior year. The prior year reflected a write-down of securitization interests.
The managed provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in the prior year and $5.0 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter provision was driven by continued high levels of charge-offs and an addition of $400 million to the allowance for loan losses, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 9.33%, up from 5.56% in the prior year and down from 10.30% in the prior quarter. The current-quarter net charge-off rate included a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from a
 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
payment holiday program offered in the second quarter of 2009. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 6.28%, up from 4.97% in the prior year and 5.99% in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, the managed net charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 8.64%, and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.52%.
Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $93 million, or 6%, reflecting efficiencies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction.

COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB)
Discussion of Results:
Net income was $224 million, a decrease of $256 million, or 53%, from the prior year, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense.
Net revenue was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $73 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $943 million, down by $160 million, or 15%, driven by spread compression on liability products and lower loan balances, partially offset by wider loan spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and overall growth in liability balances. Noninterest revenue was $463 million, an increase of $87 million, or 23%, reflecting higher lending-related fees, investment banking fees, and other income.
Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $760 million, a decrease of $36 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $191 million, a decrease of $52 million, or 21%. Revenue from Mid-Corporate Banking was $277 million, an increase of $34 million, or 14%. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $100 million, a decrease of $31 million, or 24%.
 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
The provision for credit losses was $494 million, compared with $190 million in the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment, particularly real estate-related segments. Net charge-offs were $483 million (1.92% net charge-off rate), compared with $118 million (0.40% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $291 million (1.11% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 3.12%, up from 2.45% in the prior year and 3.01% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $2.8 billion, up by $1.8 billion from the prior year and $499 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increases in each business segment.
Noninterest expense was $543 million, an increase of $44 million, or 9%, reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by lower headcount-related expense.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES (TSS)
Discussion of Results:
Net income was $237 million, a decrease of $296 million, or 56%, from the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, primarily related to declining liability balances, which had been elevated during the prior year due to extraordinary market conditions.
Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $414 million, or 18%, from the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $917 million, a decrease of $264 million, or 22%. The decrease was driven by lower balances and spreads on liability products, lower securities lending balances, and narrower spreads in foreign exchange, partially offset by the effects of market levels and net inflows of assets under custody. Treasury Services net revenue was $918 million, a decrease of $150 million, or 14%. The decrease reflected lower deposit balances and spreads, partially offset by higher card product volumes.
TSS generated firmwide net revenue of $2.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of net revenue in Treasury Services; of that amount, $918 million was recorded in the Treasury Services business, $645 million was recorded in the Commercial Banking business, and $57 million was recorded in

other lines of business. The remaining $917 million of net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services.
The provision for credit losses was $53 million, an increase of $8 million, or 18%, reflecting continued weakness in the credit environment.
Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, an increase of $52 million, or 4%, reflecting higher performance-based compensation and FDIC insurance premiums, predominantly offset by lower headcount-related expense.

ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM)
Discussion of Results:
Net income was $424 million, an increase of $169 million, or 66%, from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue offset largely by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of $537 million, or 32%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of $631 million, or 53%, predominantly due to higher valuations of seed capital investments, higher performance fees, the effect of higher market levels and higher placement fees. Net interest income was $372 million, down by $94 million, or 20%, from the prior year, due to narrower deposit spreads offset partially by wider loan spreads.
Revenue from the Private Bank was $723 million, up 15% from the prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $584 million, up 79%. Revenue from Retail was $445 million, up 68%. Revenue from Private Wealth Management remained flat at $331 million. Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services was $112 million, up 6%.
Assets under supervision were $1.7 trillion, an increase of $205 billion, or 14%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, an increase of $116 billion, or 10%, from the prior year. The increases were due to the effect of higher market levels and inflows in fixed income and equity products offset partially by outflows in cash products. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $452 billion, up by $89 billion, due to the effect of higher market levels on custody and brokerage balances, and brokerage inflows in the Private Bank.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM)
(*)
 
Discussion of Results:
Net income was $3.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses.
Managed net revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion, or 32%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up by $7.6 billion. The increase was driven by significantly higher principal transactions revenue and higher investment banking fees, partially offset by lower MSR risk management results, and the absence of a gain from the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $14.4 billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 9%, driven by lower trading-related net interest income, lower loan balances and spread compression on liability and deposit products, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income.
The managed provision for credit losses was $8.9 billion, up by $360 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 5.51% compared with 3.62% in the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion, compared with $7.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs across most consumer portfolios, partially offset by a lower addition to the allowance for credit losses primarily relating to Card Services. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $6.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 6.05% and 3.62%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $421 million, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting releases in the allowance for loan losses in the current quarter due to loan sales and repayments offset by higher charge-offs. Wholesale net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with net charge-offs of $217 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.31% and 0.33%, respectively, reflecting continued weakening in the credit environment. The firm's nonperforming assets totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $12.7 billion.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release
1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:
a. In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments.
First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remain on the balance sheet, and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer's credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm's retained interests in securitized loans.
Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase's income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis.
b. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes purchased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm's balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates exclude the impact of purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses applicable to these loans was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009. There was no allowance for loan losses recorded for these loans at December 31, 2008.
c. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of capital not in the form of common equity  such as qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position.
d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other noncompensation costs related to employees.
e. TSS firmwide revenue includes certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business, mainly CB, RFS and AM, related to customers who are also customers of those lines of business.
f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED SUMMARY (in millions)
The Firm prepares its consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). This presentation, which is referred to as "reported basis," provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financial statements.
In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results and the results of lines of business on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications that assume credit card loans securitized by Card Services remain on the balance sheet, and it presents revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. These adjustments do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole. The impact of these adjustments are summarized below. For additional information about managed basis, please refer to the Glossary of Terms on page 37.

TSS firmwide metrics include revenue recorded in the CB, Retail Banking and Asset Management ("AM") lines of business and excludes FX revenue recorded in the IB for TSS-related FX activity. In order to capture the firmwide impact of Treasury Services ("TS") and TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary in order to understand the aggregate TSS business.

Glossary of Terms
Automated Clearing House.
ACH:
Represents period-end Allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.
Allowance for loan losses to total loans :
Refers to total assets on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets plus credit card receivables that have been securitized and removed from the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Average managed assets:
Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt/equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates. The underlying obligations of the VIEs consist of short-term borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt. The related assets consist of trading assets, available-for-sale securities, loans and other assets.
Beneficial interest issued by consolidated VIEs:
In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy, whichever is earlier.
Contractual credit card charge-off:
Includes Private Equity, Treasury and Corporate Other, which includes other centrally managed expense and discontinued operations.
Corporate/Private Equity:
Card Services' managed results exclude the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. Through securitization, the Firm transforms a portion of its credit card receivables into securities, which are sold to investors. The credit card receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets through the transfer of the receivables to a trust and through the sale of undivided interests to investors that entitle the investors to specific cash flows generated from the credit card receivables. The Firm retains the remaining undivided interests as seller's interests, which are recorded in loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A gain or loss on the sale of credit card receivables to investors is recorded in other income. Securitization also affects the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income as the aggregate amount of interest income, certain fee revenue and recoveries that is in excess of the aggregate amount of interest paid to investors, gross credit losses and other trust expense related to the securitized receivables, is reclassified into credit card income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Credit card securitizations:
Financial Accounting Standards Board.
FASB:
Represent an ownership interest in cash flows of an underlying pool of receivables transferred by a third-party seller into a bankruptcy-remote entity, generally a trust.
Interests in purchased receivables:
An indication of credit quality based upon JPMorgan Chase's internal risk assessment system. "Investment-grade" generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a "BBB-"/"Baa3" or better, as defined by independent rating agencies.
Investment-grade:
A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications related to credit card securitizations and to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.
Managed basis:
Refers to credit card receivables on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets plus credit card receivables that have been securitized and removed from the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Managed credit card receivables:
A measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the mark-to-market value is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Firm. When the mark-to-market value is negative, JPMorgan Chase owes the counterparty. In this situation, the Firm does not have repayment risk.
Mark-to-market exposure:
Reflects costs associated with the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers in 2008.
Merger costs:
Includes changes in MSR asset fair value due to inputs or assumptions in model and derivative valuation adjustments and other.
MSR risk management revenue:
Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.
Net charge-off ratio:
The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.
Net yield on interest-earning assets:
Not meaningful.
NM:
Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.
Overhead ratio:
Total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
Pre-provision profit:
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodities inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value) and changes in fair value associated with financial instruments held by the Investment Bank for which the fair value option was elected. Principal transactions revenue also includes private equity gains and losses.
Principal transactions (revenue):
Financial statements prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The reported basis includes the impact of credit card securitizations, but excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.
Reported basis:
Loans that are held for investment excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.
Retained loans:
Total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to fully taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
Taxable-equivalent basis:
Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.
Unaudited:
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
U.S. GAAP:
A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.
Value-at-risk:
