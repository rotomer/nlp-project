This presentation of the previously-issued financial information does not represent a restatement of previously-issued financial statements and does not affect the Firm's reported net income, earnings per share, total assets or regulatory capital, or RFS's reported net income or total assets, for any previously-reported periods.
A copy of a presentation containing the supplemental financial information is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This presentation is being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, and the information contained therein shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Firm under the Securities Act of 1933.
