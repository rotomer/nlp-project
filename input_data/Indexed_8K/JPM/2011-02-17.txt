On February 15, 2011, JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm") held an Investor Day during which it provided information to investors about the Firm and its various lines of business. Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of the slides furnished at, and posted on the Firm's website in connection with, the presentation.
The slides are being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, and the information contained therein shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Firm under the Securities Act of 1933.
