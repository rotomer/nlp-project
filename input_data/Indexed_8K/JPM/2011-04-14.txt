Exhibit 99.1
 
WHEREAS, JPMorgan Chase & Co., New York, New York ("JPMC"), a registered bank holding company, owns and controls JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio (the "Bank"), a national bank, and numerous direct and indirect nonbank subsidiaries, including EMC Mortgage Corporation, Lewisville, Texas ("EMC") and its direct and indirect subsidiaries;
WHEREAS, JPMC has engaged in the business of servicing residential mortgage loans through non-bank subsidiaries, including EMC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Mortgage Servicing Companies"), as well as through the Bank. The Mortgage Servicing Companies have serviced residential mortgage loans that are held in the portfolios of: (a) EMC and its subsidiaries; (b) the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association (collectively, the "GSEs"); and (c) various investors, including securitization trusts pursuant to Pooling and Servicing
Agreements and similar agreements (collectively, the "Servicing Portfolio"). The Mortgage Servicing Companies have had substantial responsibilities with respect to the Servicing Portfolio for the initiation and handling of foreclosure proceedings, and loss mitigation activities ("Loss Mitigation" or "Loss Mitigation Activities" include activities related to special forbearances, repayment plans, modifications, short refinances, short sales, cash-for-keys, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure);
WHEREAS, on or about April 1, 2011, JPMC transferred all of the residential mortgage loan servicing rights and certain related assets and liabilities of the Mortgage Servicing Companies to the Bank (the "EMC Servicing Rights Transfer"). Following consummation of that transfer, the Mortgage Servicing Companies are no longer in the business of residential mortgage loan servicing, and only the Bank is conducting residential mortgage loan servicing within the JPMC organization;
WHEREAS, JPMC, through the Bank and the Mortgage Servicing Companies, collectively, is the third largest servicer of residential mortgages in the United States and services a portfolio of 8.5 million residential mortgage loans. During the recent financial crisis, a substantially larger number of residential mortgage loans became past due than in earlier years. Many of the past due mortgages have resulted in foreclosure actions. From January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, the Mortgage Servicing Companies initiated 256,179 foreclosure actions;
WHEREAS, in connection with the process leading to certain foreclosures involving the Servicing Portfolio, the Mortgage Servicing Companies allegedly:
(a) Filed or caused to be filed in state courts and in connection with bankruptcy proceedings in federal courts numerous affidavits executed by employees of the Mortgage Servicing Companies or employees of third-party providers making various
 
assertions, such as the ownership of the mortgage note and mortgage, the amount of principal and interest due, and the fees and expenses chargeable to the borrower, in which the affiant represented that the assertions in the affidavit were made based on personal knowledge or based on a review by the affiant of the relevant books and records, when, in many cases, they were not based on such knowledge or review;
(b) Filed or caused to be filed in state courts and in connection with bankruptcy proceedings in federal courts or in the local land record offices, numerous affidavits and other mortgage-related documents that were not properly notarized, including those not signed or affirmed in the presence of a notary;
(c) Litigated foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings and initiated non-judicial foreclosures without always confirming that documentation of ownership was in order at the appropriate time, including confirming that the promissory note and mortgage document were properly endorsed or assigned and, if necessary, in the possession of the appropriate party;
(d) Failed to respond in a sufficient and timely manner to the increased level of foreclosures by increasing financial, staffing, and managerial resources to ensure that the Mortgage Servicing Companies adequately handled the foreclosure process; failed to respond in a sufficient and timely manner to the increased level of Loss Mitigation Activities to ensure timely, effective and efficient communication with borrowers with respect to Loss Mitigation Activities and foreclosure activities; and full exploration of Loss Mitigation options or programs prior to completion of foreclosure activities; and
 
(e) Failed to have adequate internal controls, policies and procedures, compliance risk management, internal audit, training, and oversight of the foreclosure process, including sufficient oversight of outside counsel and other third-party providers handling foreclosure-related services with respect to the Servicing Portfolio.
WHEREAS, the practices set forth above allegedly constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices;
WHEREAS, as part of a horizontal review of various major residential mortgage servicers conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Board of Governors"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), and the Office of Thrift Supervision, examiners from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Reserve Bank") have reviewed certain residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure-related processes at the Mortgage Servicing Companies, and examiners from the OCC have reviewed certain residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure-related practices at the Bank;
WHEREAS, the Bank and the OCC have entered into a consent order to address areas of weakness identified by the OCC in residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, foreclosure activities, and related functions (the "OCC Consent Order"). Following the EMC Servicing Rights Transfer, the Servicing Portfolio will be subject to the terms of the OCC Consent Order;
WHEREAS, in the OCC Consent Order, the OCC has made findings, which the Bank neither admitted nor denied, that there were unsafe or unsound practices with respect to the manner in which the Bank handled various foreclosure and related activities;
 
WHEREAS, it is the common goal of the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank, JPMC, and the Mortgage Servicing Companies (to the extent that the Mortgage Loan Servicing Companies engage in residential mortgage loan servicing in the future) ensure that the consolidated organization operates in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the terms of mortgage loan documentation and related agreements with borrowers, all applicable state and federal laws (including the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act), rules, regulations, and court orders, as well as the Membership Rules of MERSCORP, Inc. and MERS, Inc. (collectively, "MERS"), servicing guides with GSEs or investors, and other contractual obligations including those with the Federal Housing Administration and those required by the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP"), and loss share agreements with the FDIC (collectively, "Legal Requirements");
WHEREAS, after the conduct set forth above became known, JPMC and the Mortgage Servicing Companies have been taking steps to remediate the filing of and reliance on inaccurate affidavits in foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings;
WHEREAS, the boards of directors of JPMC and EMC, at duly constituted meetings, adopted resolutions authorizing and directing Frank J. Bisignano, and Anthony J. Horan to enter into this Consent Order to Cease and Desist (the "Order") on behalf of JPMC and EMC, respectively, and consenting to compliance with each and every applicable provision of this Order by JPMC and EMC, and their institution-affiliated parties, as defined in sections 3(u) and 8(b)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the "FDI Act") (12 U.S.C.  1813(u) and 1818(b)(3)), and waiving any and all rights that JPMC and EMC may have pursuant to section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C.  1818), including, but not limited to: (i) the issuance of a notice of charges; (ii) a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on any matters set forth in this
 
Order; (iii) judicial review of this Order; (iv) contest the issuance of this Order by the Board of Governors; and (v) challenge or contest, in any manner, the basis, issuance, validity, terms, effectiveness or enforceability of this Order or any provision hereof.
NOW, THEREFORE, before the filing of any notices, or taking of any testimony or adjudication of or finding on any issues of fact or law herein, and without this Order constituting an admission by JPMC, EMC or its subsidiaries, of any allegation made or implied by the Board of Governors in connection with this matter, and solely for the purpose of settling this matter without a formal proceeding being filed and without the necessity for protracted or extended hearings or testimony, it is hereby ordered by the Board of Governors that, pursuant to sections 8(b)(1) and (3) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(1) and 1818(b)(3)), JPMC and EMC, and their institution-affiliated parties shall cease and desist and take affirmative action, as follows:
Source of Strength
1. The board of directors of JPMC shall take appropriate steps to fully utilize JPMC's financial and managerial resources, pursuant to section 225.4(a) of Regulation Y of the Board of Governors (12 C.F.R.  225.4(a)), to serve as a source of strength to the Bank, including, but not limited to, taking steps to ensure that the Bank complies with the Consent Order issued by the OCC regarding the Bank's residential mortgage loan servicing activities.
Board Oversight
2. Within 60 days of this Order, the board of directors of JPMC shall submit to the Reserve Bank an acceptable written plan to strengthen the board's oversight of JPMC's enterprise-wide risk management ("ERM"), internal audit, and compliance programs concerning
 
the residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure activities conducted through the Bank. The plan shall, at a minimum, address, consider, and include:
(a) Policies to be adopted by the board of directors of JPMC that are designed to ensure that the ERM program provides proper risk management oversight with respect to the Bank's residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure activities, particularly with respect to compliance with the Legal Requirements, and supervisory standards and guidance of the Board of Governors as they develop;

(c) steps to ensure that JPMC's ERM, audit, and compliance programs have adequate levels and types of officers and staff dedicated to overseeing the Bank's residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure activities, and that these programs have officers and staff with the requisite qualifications, skills, and abilities to comply with the requirements of this Order; and
(d) steps to improve the information and reports that will be regularly reviewed by the board of directors of JPMC or authorized committee of the board of directors regarding residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure activities and operations, including compliance risk assessments and the status and results of measures taken,
 
or to be taken, to remediate deficiencies in residential mortgage loan servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure activities, and to comply with this Order.
Foreclosure Review
3. (a) Within 45 days of this Order, JPMC and EMC shall retain one or more independent consultant(s) acceptable to the Reserve Bank to conduct an independent review of certain residential mortgage loan foreclosure actions (including judicial and non-judicial foreclosures and related bankruptcy proceedings, and other related litigation) regarding individual borrowers with respect to the Servicing Portfolio that was serviced by EMC. The review shall include actions or proceedings (including foreclosures that were in process or completed) for residential mortgage loans serviced by the Mortgage Servicing Companies whether brought in the name of the JPMC, the Mortgage Servicing Companies, the investor, or any agent for the mortgage note holder (including MERS) that have been pending at any time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, as well as residential foreclosure sales that occurred during this time period ("Foreclosure Review"). The purpose of the Foreclosure Review shall be to determine, at a minimum:
(i) whether, at the time the foreclosure action was initiated or the pleading or affidavit filed (including in bankruptcy proceedings and in defending suits brought by borrowers), the foreclosing party or agent of the party had properly documented ownership of the promissory note and mortgage (or deed of trust) under relevant state law, or was otherwise a proper party to the action as a result of agency or other similar status;
(ii) whether the foreclosure was in accordance with applicable federal and state laws, including but not limited to, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;
 
(iii) whether, with respect to non-judicial foreclosures, the procedures followed with respect to the foreclosure sale (including the calculation of the default period, the amounts due, and compliance with notice periods) and post-sale confirmation were in accordance with the terms of the mortgage loan and state law requirements;
(iv) whether a foreclosure sale occurred when the borrower had requested a loan modification or other loss mitigation and the request was under consideration, when the loan was performing in accordance with a trial or permanent loan modification, or when the loan had not been in default for a sufficient period to authorize foreclosure pursuant to terms of the mortgage loan documentation and related agreements;
(v) whether any delinquent borrower's account was charged fees or penalties that were not permissible under the terms of the borrower's loan documents, state or federal law, or were otherwise unreasonable. For purposes of this Order, a fee or penalty is "otherwise unreasonable" if it was assessed: (i) for the purpose of protecting the secured party's interest in the mortgaged property, and the fee or penalty was assessed at a frequency or rate, was of a type or amount, or was for a purpose that was in fact not needed to protect the secured party's interest; (ii) for services performed and the fee charged was substantially in excess of the fair market value of the service; (iii) for services performed, and the services were not actually performed; or (iv) at an amount or rate that exceeds what was customarily charged in the market for such a fee or penalty, and the mortgage instruments or other documents executed by the borrower did not disclose the amount or rate that the lender or servicer would charge for such a fee or penalty;
(vi) whether Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to foreclosed loans were handled in accordance with the requirements of HAMP, if applicable, and consistent with
 
the policies and procedures applicable to the Mortgage Servicing Companies' proprietary loan modifications or other Loss Mitigation programs, such that each borrower had an adequate opportunity to apply for a Loss Mitigation option or program, any such application was handled appropriately, and a final decision was made on a reasoned basis and was communicated to the borrower before the foreclosure sale; and
(vii) whether any errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies identified in the Foreclosure Review resulted in financial injury to the borrower or the owner of the mortgage loan.
(b) The independent consultant(s) shall prepare a written report detailing the findings of the Foreclosure Review (the "Foreclosure Report"). JPMC and EMC shall provide to the Reserve Bank a copy of the Foreclosure Report at the same time that the report is provided to them.

(i) remediate, as appropriate, errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies in any foreclosure filing or other proceeding;
(ii) reimburse or otherwise provide appropriate remediation to the borrower for any impermissible or otherwise unreasonable penalties, fees or expenses, or for other financial injury identified in paragraph 3 of this Order;
(iii) make appropriate adjustments for the account of JPMC, the GSEs, or any investor; and
(iv) take appropriate steps to remediate any foreclosure sale where the foreclosure was not authorized as described in paragraph 3.
 
(d) Within 60 days after the Reserve Bank accepts the plan described in paragraph 3(c), the JPMC and EMC shall make all reimbursement and remediation payments and provide all credits required by such plan, and provide the Reserve Bank with a report detailing such payments and credits;
(e) JPMC shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the Bank provides any cooperation needed by the independent consultant(s) to complete the independent review.
4. Within 5 days of the engagement of the independent consultant(s) described in paragraph 3 of this Order, but prior to the commencement of the Foreclosure Review, JPMC and EMC shall submit to the Reserve Bank for approval an engagement letter that sets forth:

In setting the scope and review methodology, the independent consultant may consider any work already done by JPMC, EMC, or other third-parties on behalf of JPMC or EMC. With respect to sampling techniques, the engagement letter shall contain a full description of the statistical basis for the sampling methods chosen, as well as procedures to increase the size of the sample depending on the results of initial sampling;
(b) the expertise and resources to be dedicated to the Foreclosure Review;

Exhibit 99.2
 
The Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America ("Comptroller"), through his national bank examiners and other staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), as part of an interagency horizontal review of major residential mortgage servicers, has conducted an examination of the residential real estate mortgage foreclosure processes of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, New York ("Bank"). The OCC has identified certain deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in residential mortgage servicing and in the Bank's initiation and handling of foreclosure proceedings. The OCC has informed the Bank of the findings resulting from the examination.
The Bank, by and through its duly elected and acting Board of Directors ("Board"), has executed a "Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order," dated April 13, 2011 ("Stipulation and Consent"), that is accepted by the Comptroller. By this Stipulation and Consent, which is incorporated by reference, the Bank has consented to the issuance of this Consent Cease and Desist Order ("Order") by the Comptroller. The Bank has committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to remedy the deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices identified by the OCC, and to enhance the Bank's residential mortgage servicing and
foreclosure processes. The Bank has begun implementing procedures to remediate the practices addressed in this Order.
The Comptroller finds, and the Bank neither admits nor denies, the following:
(1) The Bank is among the largest servicers of residential mortgages in the United States, and services a portfolio of 6,300,000 residential mortgage loans. During the recent housing crisis, a substantially large number of residential mortgage loans serviced by the Bank became delinquent and resulted in foreclosure actions. The Bank's foreclosure inventory grew substantially from 2008 through 2010.
(2) In connection with certain foreclosures of loans in its residential mortgage servicing portfolio, the Bank:
(a) filed or caused to be filed in state and federal courts affidavits executed by its employees or employees of third-party service providers making various assertions, such as ownership of the mortgage note and mortgage, the amount of the principal and interest due, and the fees and expenses chargeable to the borrower, in which the affiant represented that the assertions in the affidavit were made based on personal knowledge or based on a review by the affiant of the relevant books and records, when, in many cases, they were not based on such personal knowledge or review of the relevant books and records;
(b) filed or caused to be filed in state and federal courts, or in local land records offices, numerous affidavits or other mortgage-related documents that were not properly notarized, including those not signed or affirmed in the presence of a notary;
 
(c) litigated foreclosure proceedings and initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings without always ensuring that either the promissory note or the mortgage document were properly endorsed or assigned and, if necessary, in the possession of the appropriate party at the appropriate time;
(d) failed to devote sufficient financial, staffing and managerial resources to ensure proper administration of its foreclosure processes;
(e) failed to devote to its foreclosure processes adequate oversight, internal controls, policies, and procedures, compliance risk management, internal audit, third party management, and training; and
(f) failed to sufficiently oversee outside counsel and other third-party providers handling foreclosure-related services.
(3) By reason of the conduct set forth above, the Bank engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices.
Pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), the Comptroller hereby ORDERS that:
(1) The Board shall maintain a Compliance Committee of at least three (3) directors, of which at least two (2) may not be employees or officers of the Bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. In the event of a change of the membership, the name of any new member shall be submitted to the Examiner-in-Charge for Large Bank Supervision at the Bank ("Examiner-in-Charge"). The Compliance Committee shall be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the
 
Bank's compliance with the provisions of this Order. The Compliance Committee shall meet at least monthly and maintain minutes of its meetings.
(2) Within ninety (90) days of this Order, and within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter thereafter, the Compliance Committee shall submit a written progress report to the Board setting forth in detail actions taken to comply with each Article of this order, and the results and status of those actions.
(3) The Board shall forward a copy of the Compliance Committee's report, with any additional comments by the Board, to the Deputy Comptroller for Large Bank Supervision ("Deputy Comptroller") and the Examiner-in-Charge within ten (10) days of receiving such report.
(1) Within sixty (60) days of this Order, the Bank shall submit to the Deputy Comptroller and the Examiner-in-Charge an acceptable plan containing a complete description of the actions that are necessary and appropriate to achieve compliance with Articles IV through XII of this Order ("Action Plan"). In the event the Deputy Comptroller asks the Bank to revise the Action Plan, the Bank shall promptly make the requested revisions and resubmit the Action Plan to the Deputy Comptroller and the Examiner-in-Charge. Following acceptance of the Action Plan by the Deputy Comptroller, the Bank shall not take any action that would constitute a significant deviation from, or material change to, the requirements of the Action Plan or this Order, unless and until the Bank has received a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the Deputy Comptroller.
 
(2) The Board shall ensure that the Bank achieves and thereafter maintains compliance with this Order, including, without limitation, successful implementation of the Action Plan. The Board shall further ensure that, upon implementation of the Action Plan, the Bank achieves and maintains effective mortgage servicing, foreclosure, and loss mitigation activities (as used herein, the phrase "loss mitigation" shall include, but not be limited to, activities related to special forbearances, modifications, short refinances, short sales, cash-for-keys, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and be referred to as either "Loss Mitigation" or "Loss Mitigation Activities"), as well as associated risk management, compliance, quality control, audit, training, staffing, and related functions. In order to comply with these requirements, the Board shall:
(a) require the timely reporting by Bank management of such actions directed by the Board to be taken under this Order;
(b) follow-up on any non-compliance with such actions in a timely and appropriate manner; and
(c) require corrective action be taken in a timely manner for any non-compliance with such actions.
(3) The Action Plan shall address, at a minimum:
(a) financial resources to develop and implement an adequate infrastructure to support existing and/or future Loss Mitigation and foreclosure activities and ensure compliance with this Order;
(b) organizational structure, managerial resources, and staffing to support existing and/or future Loss Mitigation and foreclosure activities and ensure compliance with this Order;
 
(c) metrics to measure and ensure the adequacy of staffing levels relative to existing and/or future Loss Mitigation and foreclosure activities, such as limits for the number of loans assigned to a Loss Mitigation employee, including the single point of contact as hereinafter defined, and deadlines to review loan modification documentation, make loan modification decisions, and provide responses to borrowers;
(d) governance and controls to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state laws (including the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ("SCRA")), rules, regulations, and court orders and requirements, as well as the Membership Rules of MERSCORP, servicing guides of the Government Sponsored Enterprises ("GSEs") or investors, including those with the Federal Housing Administration and those required by the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP"), and loss share agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively "Legal Requirements"), and the requirements of this Order.
(4) The Action Plan shall specify timelines for completion of each of the requirements of Articles IV through XII of this Order. The timelines in the Action Plan shall be consistent with any deadlines set forth in this Order.
(1) Within sixty (60) days of this Order, the Bank shall submit to the Deputy Comptroller and the Examiner-in-Charge an acceptable compliance program to ensure that the mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations, including Loss Mitigation and loan modification, comply with all applicable Legal Requirements, OCC supervisory guidance, and the
 
requirements of this Order and are conducted in a safe and sound manner ("Compliance Program"). The Compliance Program shall be implemented within one hundred twenty (120) days of this Order. Any corrective action timeframe in the Compliance Program that is in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days must be approved by the Examiner-in-Charge. The Compliance Program shall include, at a minimum:
(a) appropriate written policies and procedures to conduct, oversee, and monitor mortgage servicing, Loss Mitigation, and foreclosure operations;
(b) processes to ensure that all factual assertions made in pleadings, declarations, affidavits, or other sworn statements filed by or on behalf of the Bank are accurate, complete, and reliable; and that affidavits and declarations are based on personal knowledge or a review of the Bank's books and records when the affidavit or declaration so states;
(c) processes to ensure that affidavits filed in foreclosure proceedings are executed and notarized in accordance with state legal requirements and applicable guidelines, including jurat requirements;
