EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This executive overview of MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Form 10-Q. For a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties, as well as the capital, liquidity, credit and market risks, and the critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, this Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety.
Economic environment
The U.S. economic recovery continued in the second quarter of
2011
, though the pace seemed to have slowed, due, in part, to the major disruptions in the global supply chain for the auto industry as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the sharp rise in oil prices during the first half of the year. Labor market indicators were weaker than anticipated in the second quarter and the struggling housing and construction sectors remained depressed. However, household spending and business investment in equipment and software continued to expand.
To promote a faster pace of economic recovery, the Federal Reserve maintained its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and completed the purchase of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve also held the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to one-quarter percent and continued to indicate that economic conditions were likely to warrant a low federal funds rate for an extended period.
Financial performance of JPMorgan Chase
Business overview
JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter
2011
net income of
$5.4 billion
, or
$1.27
per share, on net revenue of
$26.8 billion
. Net income was up
13%
compared with net income of
$4.8 billion
, or
$1.09
per share, in the second quarter of
2010
. ROE for the quarter was
12%
, unchanged from the prior year. Current-quarter results included a
$1.0 billion
pretax (
$0.15
per share after-tax) benefit from a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in
Card Services & Auto
; an
$837 million
pretax (
$0.12
per share after-tax) benefit from securities gains in Corporate; a
$1.0 billion
pretax (
$0.15
per share after-tax) expense for estimated costs of foreclosure-related matters in Retail Financial Services; and
$1.3 billion
pretax (
$0.19
per share after-tax) of additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related matters, in Corporate.
The increase in net income for the second quarter of
2011
was driven by higher net revenue and a significantly lower provision for credit losses, largely offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue growth resulted from higher levels of principal transactions revenue, investment banking fees and asset management, administration and commissions revenue, partially offset by lower net interest income and lower securities gains. The decrease in the provision for credit losses reflected improvement in the credit environment. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher noncompensation expense due to additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related matters, and expense for the estimated costs of foreclosure-related matters.
The Firms second-quarter results reflected strong earnings and solid client flows in the Investment Bank, record revenue and continued loan growth in Commercial Banking, and solid performance across most other businesses.
Consumer & Business Banking
within Retail Financial Services continued to demonstrate good underlying performance, but RFS overall continued to be negatively affected by high expenses for mortgage-related issues, including a
$1.0 billion
expense for estimated litigation and other costs of foreclosure-related matters. Results for the second quarter also reflected continued improvement in credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. With respect to the credit card portfolio, delinquencies and net charge-offs improved, and the Firm reduced loan loss reserves by
$1.0 billion
as estimated losses declined. With respect to the mortgage portfolio, delinquency and net charge-off trends improved modestly compared with the prior quarter; however, net charge-offs remained high, and credit losses are expected to remain elevated.
6
JPMorgan Chases balance sheet remained strong, ending the second quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio of
10.1%
. This strong and growing capital base enabled the Firm to repurchase
$3.5 billion
of common stock during the quarter. Total firmwide credit reserves at quarter-end were
$29.1 billion
, resulting in a firmwide loan loss coverage ratio of
3.83%
, excluding purchased credit-impaired loans. Total stockholders equity at June 30, 2011, was
$182.9 billion
.
Net income for the first six months of 2011 was
$11.0 billion
, or
$2.55
per share, compared with
$8.1 billion
, or
$1.83
per share, in the first half of 2010. The increase was driven by a significantly lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue. The lower provision for credit losses reflected an improved credit environment. The modest decline in net revenue for the first six months of the year was driven by lower net interest income, mortgage fees and related income and securities gains, largely offset by higher levels of principal transactions revenue, investment banking fees and asset management, administration and commissions revenue. The increase in noninterest expense compared with the first six months of 2010 was driven by expenses taken for the estimated costs of foreclosure-related matters in RFS and higher compensation expense.
During the first six months of 2011, JPMorgan Chase provided credit to and raised capital of over
$990 billion
for its clients. The Firm originated mortgages to more than
360,000
people; provided credit cards to approximately
4.6 million
people; lent or increased credit to more than
16,800
small businesses; lent to more than
800
not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities; extended or increased loan limits to approximately
3,000
middle-market companies; and lent to or raised capital for more than
5,000
other corporations. JPMorgan Chase is the #1 Small Business Administration lender in the U.S. with more loans made than any other lender. In 2009 and 2010, the Firm lent more than $7 billion and $10 billion, respectively, to small businesses, and has committed to lend at least $12 billion in 2011. The Firm remains committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures; since the beginning of 2009, JPMorgan Chase has offered
1,177,000
trial modifications to struggling homeowners.
The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior-year quarter and presents results on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see pages 1416 of this Form 10-Q.
Investment Bank
net income increased from the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by higher investment banking fees and solid client revenue in Fixed Income and Equity Markets. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss, primarily reflecting the negative net impact of credit-related valuation adjustments, largely offset by net interest income and fees on retained loans. The provision for credit losses was a smaller benefit in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010 and reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely due to net repayments. Noninterest expense decreased, driven by lower compensation expense. The prior-year results included the impact of the U.K. Bank Payroll Tax.
Retail Financial Services
net income decreased compared with the prior year as higher noninterest expense was largely offset by a lower provision for credit losses and higher net revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven by higher mortgage fees and related income, deposit balances, debit card income, deposit-related fees and investment sales revenue, partially offset by lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. The provision for credit losses decreased, as delinquency trends and net charge-offs modestly improved compared with the prior year. However, the current-quarter provision continued to reflect elevated losses in the mortgage and home equity portfolios. Noninterest expense increased, driven by elevated foreclosure and default-related costs, including
$1.0 billion
for estimated litigation and other costs of foreclosure-related matters.
Card Services & Auto
net income increased compared with the second quarter of 2010 driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. The decrease in net revenue was driven by a decline in net interest income, reflecting lower average loan balances (including the impact of the Kohls portfolio sale), the impact of legislative changes and a decreased level of fees. These decreases were largely offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses decreased from the prior year, reflecting lower net charge-offs and a
$1.0 billion
reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses. Noninterest expense increased, due to higher marketing expense and the inclusion of the Commercial Card business. Credit card sales volume, excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, was
$83.1 billion
, an increase of
10%
from the prior year.
Commercial Banking
net income decreased, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by record net revenue. Record net revenue was driven by growth in liability balances, wider loan spreads, higher investment banking revenue and growth in loan balances, partially offset by spread compression on liability products. The provision for credit losses was an expense compared with a benefit in the prior-year. Noninterest expense increased, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expense. End-of-period loans of $102.7 billion, up 7% compared with the second quarter 2010, have increased for four consecutive quarters. Average liability balances of $162.8 billion have increased 19% from the second quarter 2010.
Treasury & Securities Services
net income increased from the prior year, driven by higher net revenue and the credit allocation benefit related to the Global Corporate Bank (GCB), partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue increased, driven by higher market levels, higher net interest income and net inflows of assets under custody. Assets
7
under custody were a record
$16.9 trillion
, an increase of
14%
from the prior year. Treasury Services net revenue was relatively flat as higher trade loan volumes and higher deposit balances were largely offset by the effect of the transfer of the Commercial Card business to
Card
and lower spreads on deposits. Higher noninterest expense was driven by continued investment in new product platforms, primarily related to international expansion, partially offset by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to
Card
.
Asset Management
net income increased from the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue, predominantly offset by higher noninterest expense. The growth in net revenue was driven by the effect of higher market levels, net inflows to products with higher margins, higher valuations of seed capital investments, higher deposit and loan balances, and higher performance fees. The increase in revenue was partially offset by narrower deposit spreads. Assets under supervision of $1.9 trillion increased 17% from the prior year due to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to long-term products, partially offset by net outflows from liquidity products. Noninterest expense increased, largely resulting from an increase in headcount and higher performance-based compensation.
Corporate/Private Equity
net income decreased compared with the second quarter of 2010. Private equity revenue increased, primarily driven by gains on sales and net increases in investment valuations. Net interest income and securities gains decreased from the prior year. Noninterest expense was higher and included
$1.3 billion
of additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related matters. Noninterest expense in the prior year included
$694 million
of additional litigation reserves.
2011 Business outlook
The following forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chases management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firms actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 97 and Risk Factors on pages 192193 of this Form 10-Q.
JPMorgan Chases outlook for the second half of 2011 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business.
In the
Mortgage Production and Servicing
business within RFS, if mortgage interest rates remain at current levels or rise in the future, management anticipates that loan production and margins will be negatively affected, resulting in lower revenue for this business for full-year 2011 when compared with 2010. In addition, revenue in 2011 will continue to be negatively affected by continued elevated levels of repurchases of mortgages previously sold, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs). Management estimates that realized repurchase losses could be approximately
$1.2 billion
on an annualized basis for the remainder of 2011.
The Firm expects noninterest expense in
Mortgage Production and Servicing
to remain, for the remainder of the year, at elevated levels similar to those incurred in the first half of 2011 (excluding the
$1.7 billion
expense incurred during the first half of 2011 for various estimated costs related to foreclosure delays and potential settlements with federal and state officials). These higher levels of noninterest expense are expected in light of increased servicing costs to enhance the Firms mortgage servicing processes, particularly loan modification and foreclosure procedures, and comply with the Consent Orders entered into with the banking regulators. (See Enhancements to Mortgage Servicing on pages 8485 and Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q for further information about the Consent Orders.) It is also possible that the Firm will incur additional fees and assessments related to foreclosure delays as well as other costs in connection with the potential settlement of the governmental investigations related to the Firms mortgage servicing procedures.
In the Real Estate Portfolios business within RFS, management believes that, based on the current outlook for delinquencies and loss severity, total quarterly net charge-offs could be approximately
$1.2 billion
. Given current origination and production levels, combined with managements current estimate of portfolio runoff levels, the residential real estate portfolio is expected to decline by approximately
10%
to
15%
annually for the foreseeable future. The annual reduction in the residential real estate portfolio is expected to reduce net interest income in each period, including a reduction of approximately
$700 million
for full-year 2011 from the 2010 level, assuming no changes in interest rates during the year. However, over time, the reduction in net interest income is expected to be more than offset by an improvement in credit costs and lower expenses. As the portfolio continues to run off, management anticipates that approximately
$1.0 billion
of capital may become available for redeployment each year, subject to the capital requirements associated with the remaining portfolio.
In
Card
, given current high repayment rates, management expects end-of-period outstandings for the Chase credit card portfolio (excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios) could be
between $115 billion and $120 billion
by the end of 2011. Management estimates that the Washington Mutual credit card portfolio could decline to
$10 billion
by the end of 2011.
Net charge-off rates for both the Chase and Washington Mutual credit card portfolios are anticipated to continue to improve. If current delinquency trends continue, management anticipates the net charge-off rate for the Chase credit card portfolio (excluding
8
the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios) could be approximately
4.5%
for the third quarter of 2011. Recent reserve releases from the credit card allowance for loan losses reflect the continued improvement in the credit cycle. Management anticipates that as credit card net charge-offs begin to stabilize towards a normal through-the-cycle level, releases from the allowance will decline and eventually abate.
Economic data for the first half of 2011 seemed to imply that U.S. economic growth has slowed, and high unemployment rates and the difficult housing market have been persistent. Ongoing weak economic conditions, combined with elevated delinquencies and ongoing discussions regarding mortgage foreclosure-related matters with federal and state officials, continue to result in a high level of uncertainty in the residential real estate portfolio. Further declines in U.S. housing prices and increases in the unemployment rate remain possible; were this to occur, currently anticipated results for both RFS and
Card
could be adversely affected.
In IB, TSS and AM, revenue will be affected by market levels, volumes and volatility, which will influence client flows and assets under management, supervision and custody. In addition, the wholesale credit environment will influence levels of charge-offs, repayments and provision for credit losses for IB, CB and TSS.
In Private Equity, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, earnings will likely continue to be volatile and be influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific issues. Corporates net interest income levels will generally trend with the size and duration of the investment securities portfolio. Corporate net income, excluding Private Equity, and excluding significant litigation expense and significant nonrecurring items, is anticipated to trend toward approximately
$300 million
per quarter. Furthermore, continued repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in Corporate, changes in the mix of loans within the consumer loan portfolio and other factors, including continued low interest rates, could result in further downward pressure on the Firms net interest margin in the third quarter of 2011.
The Firm faces litigation in its various roles as issuer and/or underwriter in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offerings, primarily related to offerings involving third parties other than the GSEs. It is possible that these matters will take a number of years to resolve; their ultimate resolution is inherently uncertain and reserves for such litigation matters may need to be increased in the future.
Management and the Firms Board of Directors continually evaluate ways to deploy the Firms strong capital base in order to enhance shareholder value. Such alternatives could include the repurchase of common stock and warrants, increasing the common stock dividend and pursuing alternative investment opportunities. The Firm expects to utilize the authorized
$15.0 billion
, multi-year common equity repurchase program, of which up to
$8.0 billion
is approved by the Federal Reserve for 2011, to, at a minimum, repurchase the same amount of shares that it issues for employee stock-based incentive awards. Beyond this, the Firm intends to repurchase its common equity only when the Firm is generating capital in excess of that which is needed to fund its organic growth and when, in managements judgment, such repurchases provide excellent value to the Firms existing shareholders. Management and the Board will continue to assess and make decisions regarding alternatives for deploying capital, as appropriate, over the course of the year. Any planned future dividend increases over the current level, or planned use of the repurchase program over the repurchases approved for 2011, will be reviewed by the Firm with its banking regulators before taking action.

Regulatory developments
JPMorgan Chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing and understanding the implications of the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to implementing all the new rules and regulations while meeting the needs and expectations of its clients. While the Firm has made a preliminary assessment of the likely impact of certain of the anticipated changes, as more fully described below, the Firm cannot, given the current status of the regulatory developments, quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of all of the significant changes that are underway. See Risk Factors on pages 192193 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.
In February 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the FDIC issued a final rule changing its methodology for calculating the deposit insurance assessment rate for large banks. The new rule changes the assessment base from insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, and changes the assessment rate calculation. These changes became effective on April 1, 2011, and, based on the Firms understanding of the final rule, are expected to result in an aggregate annualized increase of approximately $500 million in the assessments that the Firms bank subsidiaries pay to the FDIC.
In June 2011, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) adopted rules implementing the Durbin Amendment provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits the amount the Firm may charge for each debit card transaction it processes. Based on the Firms current understanding of the final rules, which become effective on October 1, 2011, it is anticipated that such rules will result, absent mitigation, in a decline in aggregate annualized gross revenue for
Consumer & Business Banking
of approximately $1.0 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. The Firm is considering various actions it may take to mitigate some of the anticipated decline in revenue over time, though any mitigating actions are not expected to wholly offset the loss of revenue. Accordingly, the final effect of this regulation cannot be determined at this time.
The Firm will also be affected by the requirements of Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and specifically the provisions prohibiting proprietary trading and restricting the activities involving private equity and hedge funds (the Volcker Rule). However, the revenue and net earnings generated by the Firms proprietary trading activities represent a de minimis portion of the revenue and net earnings of the IB line of business and of the Firm overall. The Firm ceased some proprietary trading activities during 2010, and is planning to cease its remaining proprietary trading activities within the timeframe mandated by the Volcker Rule. In addition, the application of the Volcker Rule to the Firms private equity and hedge fund activities in its AM and IB lines of business, as well as in the Corporate/Private Equity sector, is not expected to have a significant effect on the revenue or net earnings of the Firm or those lines of business. The Firm expects that certain private equity and hedge fund activities or investments expected to be within the scope of the Volcker Rule will be redeemed or liquidated within the timeframe mandated by the Volcker Rule and the Firm is currently assessing alternative means by which either to exit any remaining activities and investments or conform them to the requirements of the Volcker Rule within the timeframe mandated.
While regulators have not yet proposed many of the rules to implement the Volcker Rule, in order to begin planning for its implementation, the Firm has attempted to identify the activities it expects to be affected by the Volcker Rule. In this regard, the Firm defines proprietary trading as the trading of securities, derivatives, or futures (or options on any of the foregoing) that is predominantly used to realize gains from short-term movements in prices for the Firms own account. The Firms proprietary trading activities are typically conducted separately from other business activities and segregated organizationally and physically from client market-making and other client-driven businesses as well as from risk management activities. The Firms definition of proprietary trading does not include client market-making, long term investment activities or risk management activities. However, until the remainder of the implementing rules are adopted, the Firm will not know the extent to which the Volcker Rule will affect its ability to engage in these activities.
In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) announced that certain global systemically important banks (GSIBs) would be required to maintain additional capital, above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum, in amounts ranging from 1% to 2.5%, depending upon the banks systemic importance. Furthermore, in order to provide a disincentive for banks facing the highest required level of Tier 1 common equity to increase materially their global systemic importance in the future, an additional 1% charge could be applied. JPMorgan Chase estimates that its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 7.6% at the end of the second quarter of 2011. This level is well in excess of that which is required today under existing rules and is greater than the level the Firm expects will be required under the proposed rules for up to five years, including the additional buffer for GSIBs. The Firm expects that its strong capital position and significant earnings power will allow it to actively grow its business and rapidly meet any proposed Basel III requirements as they are phased in. The Firm intends to keep its capital ratios approximately at current levels, subject to regulatory approval, as management does not see a need to manage to higher ratios ahead of time.

CONSOLIDATED
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The following section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chases Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see pages 9295 of this Form 10-Q and pages 149154 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Total net revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was
$26.8 billion
, an increase of
$1.7 billion
, or
7%
, from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue growth was driven by higher levels of principal transactions revenue, investment banking fees, and asset management, administration and commissions revenue, largely offset by lower net interest income. For the first six months of 2011, total net revenue was
$52.0 billion
, a modest decline compared with the first six months of 2010, as lower net interest income, mortgage fees and related income, and securities gains more than offset revenue growth from higher levels of principal transactions revenue, investment banking fees, and asset management, administration and commissions revenue.
Investment banking fees increased compared with both the second quarter and first six months of 2010 and were a record for the first six months of 2011. Debt underwriting fees were also a record for the first six months of 2011. Advisory fees, debt underwriting fees and equity underwriting fees were higher in both periods of comparison, as industry-wide M&A and capital-raising volumes increased from their 2010 levels. For additional information on investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 1922 of this Form 10-Q.
Principal transactions revenue increased compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2010, primarily driven by gains on sales and net increases in investment valuations in Corporate/Private Equity, as a result of continued improvement in market conditions related to certain portfolio investments. Trading revenue increased in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010 but decreased in the first half of 2011 compared with the first half of 2010. Client revenue in IB remained solid in both periods of comparison, reflecting the strength and depth of the client franchise. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see IB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 1922 and 4647, respectively, and Note 6 on pages 124125 of this Form 10-Q.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the introduction of a new checking account product offering in RFS, and the conversion of some existing checking accounts into the new product offering; partially offset by the impact of nonsufficient fund/overdraft (NSF/OD) regulatory and policy changes. For the first six months of 2011, lending- and deposit-related fees declined slightly compared with the prior year, reflecting lower deposit-related fees in RFS associated, in part, with the impact of the aforementioned regulatory and policy changes. These declines were partially offset by higher lending-related fees in IB. For additional information on lending- and deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in RFS, CB, TSS and IB, see RFS on pages 2332, CB on pages 3638, TSS on pages 3941 and IB segment results on pages 1922 of this Form 10-Q.
Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased from the second quarter and first six months of 2010. The increases reflected higher asset management fees in AM, driven by the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to longer-term products with higher margins. To a lesser extent, higher administration fees in TSS, reflecting the effect of higher market levels and net inflows of assets under custody, also contributed to the increases in revenue. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for AM on pages 4245 and TSS on pages 3941 of this Form 10-Q.
Securities gains decreased from the second quarter and first six months of 2010, resulting primarily from the repositioning of the portfolio in response to changes in the interest rate environment and rebalancing exposures. For additional information on securities gains, which are mostly recorded in the Firm's Corporate segment, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 4647 of this Form 10-Q.

Mortgage fees and related income increased compared with the second quarter of 2010, driven by an increase in production revenue, reflecting wider margins and lower levels of repurchase losses; this increase was largely offset by a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue due to lower MSR risk management revenue. Mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the first six months of 2010; the decrease was driven by a
$1.1 billion
decline in the fair value of the MSR asset that was recognized in the first quarter of 2011 related to a revised cost to service assumption incorporated into the valuation to reflect the estimated impact of higher servicing costs to enhance servicing processes  particularly loan modification and foreclosure procedures, and higher estimated costs to comply with Consent Orders entered into with banking regulators. The decline in the fair value of the MSR asset also resulted from a decrease in interest rates. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in production revenue, driven by the impact of higher mortgage origination volumes and wider margins, as well as lower levels of repurchase losses. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS, see RFS's
Mortgage Production and Servicing
discussion on pages 27-29 of this Form 10-Q. For additional information on repurchase losses, see the Mortgage repurchase liability discussion on pages 53-56 and Note 21 on pages 167-171 of this Form 10-Q.
Credit card income increased in both the second quarter and first half of 2011. The increase in the quarter largely reflected higher net interchange income associated with higher customer charge volume on debit and credit cards, as well as lower partner revenue-sharing (a contra-revenue item) due to the impact of the Kohl's portfolio sale. The increase in the first six months of 2011 was driven by higher net interchange income, partially offset by lower revenue from fee-based products. For additional information on credit card income, see the
Card
and RFS segment results on pages 3335, and pages 2332, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Other income increased compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2010, driven by valuation adjustments on certain assets and incremental income from recent acquisitions in IB, as well as higher valuations of seed capital investments in AM. Higher auto operating lease income in
Card
, resulting from growth in lease volume, also contributed to the increase.
Net interest income decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 compared with the prior year. The declines in both periods were driven by lower yields on securities; lower average loan balances and yields, primarily in
Card
and RFS, reflecting the expected runoff of credit card balances and residential real estate loans; lower fees on credit card receivables, reflecting the impact of legislative changes; and lower yields on deposits. The decrease was offset partially by lower revenue reversals associated with lower credit card charge-offs, and higher average deposit balances. The Firm's average interest-earning assets were
$1.8 trillion
in the second quarter of 2011, and the net yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, was
2.72%
, a decrease of
34
basis points from the second quarter of 2010. For the first six months of 2011, average interest-earning assets were
$1.7 trillion
, and the net yield on those assets, on an FTE basis, was
2.80%
, a decrease of
39
basis points from the first six months of 2010. For further information on the impact of the legislative changes on the Consolidated Statements of Income, see
Card
discussion on credit card legislation on page 79 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.
The provision for credit losses decreased significantly compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2010. The credit card provision was down from both prior-year periods, driven primarily by improved delinquency trends and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses as a result of lower estimated losses. The consumer, excluding credit card, provision was also down from both prior-year periods, reflecting improving delinquency and charge-off trends in 2011 across most portfolios and the absence of additions to the allowance for loan losses. The wholesale provision reflected a lower benefit for both the second quarter and first six months of 2011 compared with the prior-year periods. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions for RFS on pages 2332,
Card
on pages 3335, IB on pages 1922 and CB on pages 3638, and the Allowance for credit losses section on pages 8688 of this Form 10-Q.
12
Total noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2011 was
$16.8 billion
, an increase of
$2.2 billion
, or
15%
, compared with the second quarter of 2010. Total noninterest expense for the first six months of 2011 was
$32.8 billion
, up by
$2.1 billion
, or
7%
, compared with the first six months of 2010. The increases in both periods of comparison were due to higher noncompensation expense, which included elevated levels of litigation expense related to mortgage-related matters and an increase in other expense for foreclosure-related matters. Higher compensation expense also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense for the first half of 2011.
Compensation expense decreased slightly from the second quarter of 2010, as the prior-year results included the impact of the U.K. Bank Payroll Tax in IB. Compensation expense increased from the first six months of 2010, due to higher salary and benefits expense in IB, as well as additions to the sales force and employees engaged in default-related matters associated with the serviced portfolio in RFS, and front office staff in AM; these increases were partially offset by the aforementioned payroll tax in IB in 2010.
The increase in noncompensation expense in the second quarter of 2011 was due to higher litigation expense, which included an addition of
$1.3 billion
to litigation reserves in Corporate predominantly for mortgage-related matters; and a
$1.0 billion
expense for estimated litigation and other costs of foreclosure-related matters in RFS. Noncompensation expense for the first six months of 2011 was also affected by these items, together with an additional
$650 million
expense for estimated litigation and other costs of foreclosure-related matters in RFS in the first quarter of 2011. Litigation expense in the first half of 2011 decreased from the prior year, as the aforementioned charges for mortgage-related matters were lower than those incurred in 2010. For a further discussion of litigation expense, see the Litigation reserve discussion in Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q.
In addition to the items mentioned above, the following items in noncompensation expense were higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2011: professional services expense, due to Consent Orders and foreclosure-related matters in RFS and continued investments in new product platforms in the businesses; marketing expense in
Card
; and all other expense, reflecting higher FDIC assessments in 2011 and additional operating expense related to business activities in IB. For a discussion of amortization of intangibles, refer to the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 4951, and Note 16 on pages 159163 of this Form 10-Q.
The increase in the effective tax rate during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, compared with the prior-year periods was primarily the result of higher reported pretax income and changes in the mix of income subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, as well as lower tax benefits recognized upon the resolution of tax audits. These factors were partially offset by deferred tax benefits associated with state and local income taxes. For additional information on income taxes, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 9295 of this Form 10-Q.

The Firm prepares its consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP); these financial statements appear on pages 98101 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation, which is referred to as reported" basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firms results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firms performance with other companies U.S. GAAP financial statements.
In addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firms results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
Tangible common equity (TCE), a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE, a non-GAAP financial ratio, measures the Firms earnings as a percentage of TCE. In managements view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with competitors.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the business-segment level, because it believes these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the business segment with the performance of its competitors. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firms reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Other financial measures
The Firm also discloses the allowance for loan losses to total retained loans, excluding home lending PCI loans. For a further discussion of this credit metric, see Allowance for credit losses on pages 8688 of this Form 10-Q.

The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. The business segment financial results presented reflect the current organization of JPMorgan Chase. There are six major reportable business segments: the Investment Bank, Retail Financial Services,
Card Services & Auto
, Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management, as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis.
Subsequent business segment changes
Commencing July 1, 2011, the Firms business segments have been reorganized as follows:
Auto and Student Lending transferred from the RFS segment and are reported with
Card
in a single segment. Retail Financial Services continues as a segment, organized in two components: Consumer & Business Banking (formerly Retail Banking) and Mortgage Banking (including Mortgage Production and Servicing, and Real Estate Portfolios).
The business segment information associated with RFS and Card has been revised to reflect the business reorganization retroactive to January 1, 2010.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results allocates income and expense using market-based methodologies. For a further discussion of those methodologies, see Business Segment Results  Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 6768 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report. The Firm continues to assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.
Business segment capital allocation changes
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, economic risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Effective January 1, 2011, capital allocated to
Card
was reduced and that of TSS was increased. For further information about these capital changes, see Line of business equity on pages 6061 of this Form 10-Q.

Quarterly results
Net income was $2.1 billion, up 49% from the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $7.3 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 37% to $1.9 billion, consisting of debt underwriting fees of $866 million (up 24%), equity underwriting fees of $455 million (up 29%), and advisory fees of $601 million (up 69%). Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $5.5 billion, compared with $4.6 billion in the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $111 million, primarily reflecting the negative net impact of credit-related valuation adjustments, largely offset by net interest income and fees on retained loans.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $183 million, compared with a benefit of $325 million in the prior year. The current-quarter benefit primarily reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely due to net repayments. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.10%, compared with 3.98% in the prior year, driven by the improved quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs were $7 million, compared with net charge-offs of $28 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, down 4% from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower compensation expense. The prior-year results included the impact of the U.K. Bank Payroll Tax.
Return on equity was 21% on $40.0 billion of average allocated capital.
Year-to-date results
Net income was $4.4 billion, up 15% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher net revenue, partially offset by a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $15.5 billion, compared with $14.7 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were a record, up 30% to $3.7 billion, consisting of record debt underwriting fees of $1.8 billion (up 29%), advisory fees of $1.0 billion (up 56%), and equity underwriting fees of $834 million (up 9%). Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $12.1 billion, compared with $11.5 billion in the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $301 million, primarily reflecting the negative net impact of credit-related valuation adjustments, largely offset by net interest income and fees on retained loans.
The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $612 million, compared with a benefit of $787 million in the prior year. The current-year benefit primarily reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely as a result of net repayments and loan sales. Net charge-offs were $130 million, compared with net charge-offs of $725 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $9.3 billion, approximately flat from the prior year. Compensation expense was flat to the prior year, as higher salaries & benefits and performance-based compensation expense was predominantly offset by the absence of the U.K. Bank Payroll Tax in the current period. Noncompensation expense was also approximately flat to the prior year.
Return on equity was 22% on $40.0 billion of average allocated capital.

Included within Real Estate Portfolios are PCI loans that the Firm acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. For PCI loans, the excess of the undiscounted gross cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the loans (the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected life of the loans.
The net spread between the PCI loans and the related liabilities are expected to be relatively constant over time, except for any basis risk or other residual interest rate risk that remains and for certain changes in the accretable yield percentage (e.g., from extended loan liquidation periods and from prepayments). As of
June 30, 2011
, the remaining weighted-average life of the PCI loan portfolio is expected to be 6.9 years. For further information, see Note 13, PCI loans, on pages 145146 of this Form 10-Q. The loan balances are expected to decline more rapidly in the earlier years as the most troubled loans are liquidated, and more slowly thereafter as the remaining troubled borrowers have limited refinancing opportunities. Similarly, default and servicing expense are expected to be higher in the earlier years and decline over time as liquidations slow down.
To date the impact of the PCI loans on Real Estate Portfolios net income has been modestly negative. This is due to the current net spread of the portfolio, the provision for loan losses recognized subsequent to its acquisition, and the higher level of default and servicing expense associated with the portfolio. Over time, the Firm expects that this portfolio will contribute positively to net income.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.1 billion, compared with $536 million in the prior year. The improved results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue.
End-of-period loans were $186.3 billion, a decrease of $19.3 billion, or 9%, from the prior year. Average loans were $186.1 billion, a decrease of $24.3 billion, or 12%, from the prior year. The declines in both end-of-period and average total loans, predominantly related to the credit card portfolio, were consistent with expectations. The credit card end-of-period and average loan totals also reflected the impact of the Firms sale of the $3.7 billion Kohls portfolio on April 1, 2011.
Net revenue was $4.8 billion, a decrease of $301 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.5 billion, down by $481 million, or 12%. The decrease in net interest income was driven by lower average loan balances (including the impact of the Kohls portfolio sale), the impact of legislative changes and a decreased level of fees. These decreases were largely offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million, or 16%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by lower partner revenue-sharing due to the impact of the Kohls portfolio sale, higher net interchange income and the transfer of the Commercial Card business to Card from TSS in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest revenue increased 9%.
The provision for credit losses was $944 million, compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a reduction of $1.0 billion to the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a reduction of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses. The net charge-off rate was 4.24%, down from 7.48% in the prior year. The 30+ day delinquency rate
was 2.38%, down from 3.77% in the prior year. Card Services', excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, net charge-off rate
1
was 5.28%, down from 9.02% in the prior year; and the 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.73%, down from 4.48% in the prior year. The auto loan net charge-off rate was 0.16%, down from 0.49% in the prior year. The student loan net charge-off rate was 3.83%, up from 3.01% in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, an increase of $216 million, or 12%, from the prior year, due to higher marketing expense and the inclusion of the Commercial Card business. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest expense increased 8%.
33
Year-to-date results
Net income was $2.6 billion, compared with $398 million in the prior year. The improved results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue.
Average loans were $190.4 billion, a decrease of $25.0 billion, or 12%, from the prior year. The decline in average total loans, predominantly related to the credit card portfolio, was consistent with expectations and also reflected the impact of the Firms sale of the $3.7 billion Kohls portfolio on April 1, 2011.
Net revenue was $9.6 billion, a decrease of $763 million, or 7%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $7.2 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 12%. The decrease in net interest income was driven by lower average loan balances (including the impact of the Kohls portfolio sale), the impact of legislative changes and a decreased level of fees. These decreases were largely offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of $240 million, or 11%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to
Card
from TSS in the first quarter of 2011 and higher net interchange income, partially offset by lower revenue from fee-based products. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest revenue increased 4%.
The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, compared with $6.1 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a reduction of $3.0 billion to the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a reduction of $2.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses. The net charge-off rate was 4.61%, down from 8.11% in the prior year. Card Services', excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, net charge-off rate
1
was 5.75%, down from 9.80% in the prior year. The auto loan net charge-off rate was 0.28%, down from 0.68% in the prior year. The student loan net charge-off rate was 3.04%, up from 2.48% in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $3.9 billion, an increase of $386 million, or 11%, from the prior year, due to the inclusion of the Commercial Card business and higher marketing expense. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest expense increased 7%.

Net revenue was a record $1.6 billion, up by $141 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $1.0 billion, up by $89 million, or 9%, driven by growth in liability balances, wider loan spreads and higher loan balances, partially offset by spread compression on liability products. Noninterest revenue was $598 million, up $52 million, or 10%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher investment banking revenue.
Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $789 million, an increase of $22 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $286 million, an increase of $49 million, or 21%.

The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.56%, down from 2.82% in the prior year. Nonaccrual loans were $1.6 billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 47%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting commercial real estate repayments and loan sales.
Noninterest expense was $563 million, an increase of $21 million, or 4%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expense.
Year-to-date results

Quarterly results
Net income was $333 million, an increase of $41 million, or 14%, from the prior year.
Net revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of $51 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, net revenue was up 6%. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $1.0 billion, an increase of $47 million, or 5%. The increase was driven by higher market levels, higher net interest income and net inflows of assets under custody. Treasury Services net revenue was $930 million, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as higher trade loan volumes and higher deposit balances were largely offset by the transfer of Commercial Card business to
Card Services & Auto
in the first quarter of 2011 and lower spreads on deposits. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, TS net revenue increased 7%.
TSS generated firmwide net revenue of $2.6 billion, including $1.6 billion by Treasury Services; of that amount, $930 million was recorded in Treasury Services, $556 million in Commercial Banking and $65 million in other lines of business. The remaining $1.0 billion of firmwide net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services.
Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $54 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by continued investment in new product platforms, primarily related to international expansion, partially offset by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to
Card Services & Auto
. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, TSS noninterest expense increased 9%.
Results for the quarter included a $32 million pretax benefit related to the allocation between IB and TSS associated with credit extended to Global Corporate Bank (GCB) clients. IB manages core credit exposures related to the GCB on behalf of IB and TSS. Effective January 1, 2011, IB and TSS share the economics related to the Firm's GCB clients. Included within this allocation are net revenues and provision for credit losses as well as expenses.
Year-to-date results

Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of $122 million, or 7%. The increase was driven by higher market levels, net inflows of assets under custody, and higher net interest income. Treasury Services net revenue was $1.8 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as higher trade loan volumes and higher deposit balances were largely offset by the transfer of Commercial Card business to
Card Services & Auto
in the first quarter of 2011 and lower spreads on deposits. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, TS net revenue increased 7%.
TSS generated firmwide net revenue of $5.0 billion, including $3.0 billion by Treasury Services; of that amount, $1.8 billion was recorded in Treasury Services, $1.1 billion in Commercial Banking and $128 million in other lines of business. The remaining $2.0 billion of firmwide net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services.
Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increase of $106 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by continued investment in new product platforms, primarily related to international expansion, partially offset by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to

Consolidated Balance Sheets overview
JPMorgan Chases assets and liabilities increased from
December 31, 2010
, predominantly due to an overall growth in wholesale clients cash management activities in the first six months of 2011, as well as an increase in deposit inflows toward the end of the second quarter of
2011
. The inflows contributed to higher deposits with banks  in particular, balances due from Federal Reserve Banks. In addition to deposits with banks, other factors affecting the increase in total assets included higher accrued interest and accounts receivable offset partially by lower trading assets  debt and equity instruments. In addition to deposits, other factors affecting the increase in total liabilities were higher commercial paper, and accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by lower federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and lower beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. The increase in stockholders equity primarily reflected net income for the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, net of repurchases of common stock and the declaration of dividends.
49
The following is a discussion of the significant changes in the specific line captions of the Consolidated Balance Sheets from
December 31, 2010
. For a description of the specific line captions discussed below, see pages 9294 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Deposits with banks; federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements; and securities borrowed
Deposits with banks increased significantly, reflecting a higher level of balances due from Federal Reserve Banks; the increase was predominantly the result of an overall growth in wholesale clients cash management activities in the first six months of 2011, as well as an increase in inflows of short-term wholesale deposits from TSS clients toward the end of June 2011. For additional information, see the deposits discussion below. Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed decreased predominantly in IB, reflecting lower client financing activity.
Trading assets and liabilities
debt and equity instruments
Trading assets  debt and equity instruments decreased based upon client market-making activity in IB. The decrease was primarily due to declines in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and equity securities, partially offset by an increase in non-U.S. government debt securities. For additional information, refer to Note 3 on pages 102114 of this Form 10-Q.
Trading assets and liabilities
derivative receivables and payables
Derivative receivables and payables decreased, largely due to a reduction in foreign exchange derivatives offset partially by an increase in equity derivatives, from IBs market-making activity. For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 7375, and Note 3 and Note 5 on pages 102114 and 117124, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Securities
Securities increased, largely due to repositioning of the portfolio in Corporate in response to changes in the interest rate environment. This repositioning increased the levels of non-U.S. government debt and mortgage-backed securities, and reduced the levels of corporate debt and U.S. government agency securities. For additional information related to securities, refer to the discussion in the Corporate/Private Equity segment on pages 4647, and Note 3 and Note 11 on pages 102114 and 128132, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Loans and allowance for loan losses
Loans decreased modestly, reflecting continued portfolio runoff in RFS, as well as lower seasonal
balances, higher repayment rates, continued runoff of the Washington Mutual portfolio and the sale of the Kohls portfolio in
Card
. These decreases were offset partially by an increase in wholesale loans, reflecting growth in client activity in all of the Firms wholesale bu
sinesses. The allowance for loan losses decreased, predominantly as a result of lower estimated losses in the credit card loan portfolio, as well as loan sales and net repayments in the wholesale portfolio. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 6788, and Notes 3, 4, 13 and 14 on pages 102114, 114116, 134148 and 149150, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable
Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased, largely from higher receivables from securities transactions pending settlement.
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs decreased, primarily due to changes to inputs and assumptions in the MSR valuation model. During the first quarter of 2011, the Firm revised its cost to service assumption to reflect the estimated impact of higher servicing costs to enhance servicing processes, particularly loan modification and foreclosure procedures, including costs to comply with Consent Orders entered into with banking regulators, which resulted in a
$1.1 billion
decrease in the fair value of the MSR asset. Declining interest rates also contributed to the decrease in the fair value of the MSR asset. Other than the increased cost to service assumption and the decrease in interest rates, predominately all of the changes in the fair value of the MSR asset resulted from the largely offsetting impacts of new capitalization and amortization. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 3 and Note 16 on pages 102114 and 159163, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Other intangible assets
The decrease in other intangible assets was predominantly due to amortization. For additional information on other intangible assets, see Note 16 on pages 159163 of this Form 10-Q.
Deposits
Deposits increased significantly, predominantly as a result of an overall growth in wholesale clients cash management activities during the first six months of 2011 and an increase in inflows toward the end of June 2011 of short-term wholesale deposits from TSS clients. Also contributing to the increase in deposits was growth in the number of clients and higher balances in CB, AM and RFS (the RFS deposits were net of the attrition related to inactive and low-balance Washington Mutual accounts). For more information on deposits, refer to the RFS and AM segment discussions on pages 2332 and 4245, respectively; the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 6266; and Notes 3 and 17 on pages 102114 and 164, respectively, of this Form 10-Q. For more information on wholesale liability balances, which includes deposits, refer to the CB and TSS segment discussions on pages 3638 and 3941, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
50
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased predominantly in IB, due to lower financing of the Firms trading assets, as well as lower client financing balances. For additional information on the Firms Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 6266 of this Form 10-Q.
Commercial paper and other borrowed funds
Commercial paper and other borrowed funds increased, due to growth in the volume of liability balances in sweep accounts related to TSSs cash management product, and a modest incremental increase in commercial paper issued in wholesale funding markets. For additional information on the Firms Liquidity Risk Management and other borrowed funds, see pages 6266, and Note 18 on page 164 of this Form 10-Q.
Accounts payable and other liabilities
Accounts payable and other liabilities increased, largely due to higher IB Prime Services customer balances and additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related matters.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
Beneficial interests decreased, predominantly due to maturities of Firm-sponsored credit card securitization transactions. For additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, see OffBalance Sheet Arrangements below, and Note 15 on pages 151159 of this Form 10-Q.
Long-term debt
Long-term debt increased, due to net issuances of long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Firms long-term debt activities, see the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 6266 of this Form 10-Q.
Stockholders equity
Total stockholders equity increased, predominantly due to net income in the first half of 2011; a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting net unrealized gains on AFS securities associated with increased market values on agency MBS and municipal securities, partially offset by the widening of spreads on non-U.S. corporate debt, the realization of gains due to portfolio repositioning, and the net change in the fair values of derivatives used for cash flow-hedging purposes; and net issuances and commitments to issue under the Firms employee stock-based compensation plans. The increase was partially offset by repurchases of common stock and the declaration of cash dividends on common and preferred stock.
51
JPMorgan Chase is involved with several types of offbalance sheet arrangements, including through special-purpose entities (SPEs), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). For further discussion, see OffBalance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Cash Obligations on pages 95101
of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Special-purpose entities
SPEs are the most common type of VIE, used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute related cash flows to investors. SPEs continue to be an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees. For further information on the Firms involvement with SPEs, see Note 15 on pages 151159 of this Form 10-Q; and Note 1 on pages 164165 and Note 15 on pages 244259 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required to provide funding if the short-term credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., were downgraded below specific levels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 for Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch, respectively. The aggregate amounts of these liquidity commitments, to both consolidated and nonconsolidated SPEs, were
$35.7 billion
and
$34.2 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. Alternatively, if JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., were downgraded, the Firm could be replaced by another liquidity provider in lieu of providing funding under the liquidity commitment or, in certain circumstances, the Firm could facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets in the SPE in order to provide liquidity.
Special-purpose entities revenue
The following table summarizes certain revenue information related to consolidated and nonconsolidated VIEs with which the Firm has significant involvement. The revenue reported in the table below primarily represents contractual servicing and credit fee income (i.e., income from acting as administrator, structurer or liquidity provider). It does not include gains and losses from changes in the fair value of trading positions (such as derivative transactions) entered into with VIEs. Those gains and losses are recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Offbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firms view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees and the Firms accounting for them, see Lending-related commitments on page 75 and Note 21 on pages 167171 of this Form 10-Q; and Lending-related commitments on page 128 and Note 30 on pages 275280 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
The following table presents, as of
June 30, 2011
, the amounts by contractual maturity of offbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments. The amounts in the table for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit to borrowers for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products would be used by borrowers at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. The accompanying table excludes certain guarantees that do not have a contractual maturity date (e.g., loan sale and securitization-related indemnification obligations). For further information, see discussion of Mortgage repurchase liability and Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications on
52
pages 5356 and in Note 21 on pages 167171, respectively, of this Form 10-Q, and Repurchase liability and Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications on pages 98101 and in Note 30 on pages 275280, respectively, of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Mortgage repurchase liability
In connection with the Firms mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) and other mortgage loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties; however, predominantly all of the
53
repurchase demands received by the Firm and the Firms losses realized to date are related to loans sold to the GSEs. The primary reasons for repurchase demands from the GSEs relate to alleged misrepresentations primarily arising from: (i) credit quality and/or undisclosed debt of the borrower; (ii) income level and/or employment status of the borrower; and (iii) appraised value of collateral. In substantially all instances where mortgage insurance has been rescinded, this resulted in a violation of representations and warranties made to the GSEs and, therefore, has also been a cause of repurchase demands from the GSEs.
From 2005 to 2008, excluding Washington Mutual, loans sold to the GSEs subject to certain representations and warranties for which the Firm may be liable were approximately
$380 billion
; this amount represents the principal amount sold and has not been adjusted for subsequent activity, such as borrower repayments of principal or repurchases completed to date. In addition, from 2005 to 2008, Washington Mutual sold approximately
$150 billion
of loans to the GSEs subject to certain representations and warranties. Subsequent to the Firms acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Washington Mutual from the FDIC in September 2008, the Firm resolved and/or limited certain current and future repurchase demands for loans sold to the GSEs by Washington Mutual, although it remains the Firms position that such obligations remain with the FDIC receivership. For additional information regarding loans sold to the GSEs, see Repurchase liability on pages 98101 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
The Firm also sells loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by a government agency. The Firm, in its role as servicer, may elect, but is not required, to repurchase delinquent loans securitized by Ginnie Mae, including those that have been sold back to Ginnie Mae subsequent to modification. Amounts due under the terms of these repurchased loans continue to be insured and the reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally. Accordingly, the Firm has not recorded any repurchase liability related to these loans.
From 2005 to 2008, the Firm and certain acquired entities made certain loan level representations and warranties in connection with approximately
$450 billion
of residential mortgage loans that were sold or deposited into private-label securitizations. Of the
$450 billion
originally sold or deposited (including
$165 billion
by Washington Mutual, as to which the Firm maintains that certain of the repurchase obligations remain with the FDIC receivership), approximately
$185 billion
of principal has been repaid (including
$68 billion
related to Washington Mutual). Approximately
$90 billion
of the principal has been liquidated (including
$32 billion
related to Washington Mutual), with an average loss severity of
58%
. The remaining outstanding principal balance of these loans (including Washington Mutual) was, as of
June 30, 2011
, approximately
$175 billion
of which
$62 billion
was 60 days or more past due. The remaining outstanding principal balance of loans related to Washington Mutual was approximately
$65 billion
of which
$23 billion
were 60 days or more past due. For additional information regarding loans sold to private investors, see Repurchase liability on pages 98101 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
To date, loan-level repurchase demands in private-label securitizations have been limited. As a result, the Firms repurchase reserve primarily relates to loan sales to the GSEs and is predominantly calculated based on the Firms repurchase activity experience with the GSEs. While it is possible that the volume of repurchase demands from other investors in private-label securitizations will increase in the future, the Firm cannot offer a reasonable estimate of those future demands based on historical experience to date. To the extent that repurchase demands are received related to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the related third party. Claims related to private-label securitizations (including claims from insurers that have guaranteed certain obligations of the securitization trusts) have, thus far, generally manifested themselves through securities-related litigation. The Firm does not consider these claims in estimating its repurchase liability; rather, the Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q.
Estimated Mortgage Repurchase Liability
To estimate the Firms repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, the Firm considers:
Based on these factors, the Firm has recognized a repurchase liability of
$3.6 billion
and
$3.3 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. For further discussion of the repurchase demand process and the approach used by the Firm to estimate the repurchase liability, see Repurchase liability on pages 98101 of JPMorgan Chases

The following table provides information about outstanding repurchase demands and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices, excluding those related to Washington Mutual, at each of the past five quarter-end dates.
Outstanding repurchase demands and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices by counterparty type
 
(a)
The following tables show the trend in repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescission notices received by loan origination vintage, excluding those related to Washington Mutual, for the past five quarters. The Firm expects repurchase demands to remain at elevated levels.
Quarterly mortgage repurchase demands received by loan origination vintage
 
(a)
(a) Prior periods have been revised to include repurchase demands related to certain loans sold or deposited into private-label securitizations.
Quarterly mortgage insurance rescission notices received by loan origination vintage
 
(a)
Because the Firm has demonstrated an ability to cure certain types of defects more frequently than others (e.g., missing documents), trends in the types of defects identified as well as the Firms historical data are considered in estimating the future cure rate. Since the beginning of 2010, the Firms overall cure rate, excluding Washington Mutual, has been approximately
50%
. Repurchases that have resulted from mortgage insurance rescissions are reflected in the Firms overall cure rate. While the actual cure rate may vary from quarter to quarter, the Firm expects that the overall cure rate will remain in the
4050%
range for the foreseeable future.
The Firm has not observed a direct relationship between the type of defect that causes the breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the realized loss. Therefore, the loss severity assumption is estimated using the Firms historical experience and projections regarding home price appreciation. Actual loss severities on finalized repurchases and make-whole settlements to date, excluding any related to Washington Mutual, currently average approximately
50%
, but may vary from quarter to quarter based on the characteristics of the underlying loans and changes in home prices.
When a loan was originated by a third-party correspondent, the Firm typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the correspondent originator. Correspondent-originated loans comprise approximately
59%
of loans underlying outstanding repurchase demands, excluding those related to Washington Mutual. The actual third-party recovery rate may vary from quarter to quarter based upon the underlying mix of correspondents (e.g., active, inactive, out-of-business originators) from which recoveries are being sought.
55
The Firm has entered into agreements with two mortgage insurers to resolve their claims on certain portfolios for which the Firm is a servicer. These two agreements cover and have resolved approximately one-third of the Firm's total mortgage insurance rescission risk exposure, both in terms of the unpaid principal balance of serviced loans covered by mortgage insurance and the amount of mortgage insurance coverage. The impact of these agreements is reflected in the repurchase liability and the disclosed outstanding mortgage insurance rescission notices as of June 30, 2011. The Firm has considered its remaining unresolved mortgage insurance rescission risk exposure in estimating the repurchase liability as of June 30, 2011.
Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm's established methodology for computing its recorded repurchase liability  including the amount of probable future demands from purchasers (which is in part based on the historical experience), the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure and recoveries from third parties  require application of a significant level of management judgment. Estimating the repurchase liability is further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors, including: (i) economic factors (for example, further declines in home prices and changes in borrower behavior may lead to increases in the number of defaults, the severity of losses, or both), and (ii) the level of future demands, which is dependent, in part, on actions taken by third parties, such as the GSEs and mortgage insurers. While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain, imprecise and potentially volatile as additional information is obtained and external factors continue to evolve.
The following table summarizes the change in the repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.

The following discussion of
JPMorgan Chase
s capital management highlights developments since
December 31, 2010
, and should be read in conjunction with Capital Management on pages 102106 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The Firms capital management objectives are to hold capital sufficient to:
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firms national banks, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and Chase Bank USA, N.A. As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
,
JPMorgan Chase
and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.
The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for
JPMorgan Chase
and its significant banking subsidiaries at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. These amounts are determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and/or OCC.
57
Note: Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both nontaxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from nontaxable business combinations totaling
$576 million
and
$647 million
, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of
$2.1 billion
and
$1.9 billion
, respectively.
A reconciliation of Total stockholders equity to Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total qualifying capital is presented in the table below.
The Firms Tier 1 common capital was
$121.2 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$114.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, an increase of
$6.4 billion
. The increase was predominantly due to net income (adjusted for DVA) of
$10.9 billion
and net issuances and commitments to issue common stock under the Firms employee stock-based compensation plans of
$1.1 billion
. The increase was partially offset by
$3.6 billion
of repurchases of common stock and
$2.4 billion
of dividends on common and preferred stock. The Firms Tier 1 capital was
$148.9 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$142.5 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, an increase of
$6.4 billion
. The increase in Tier 1 capital reflected the increase in Tier 1 common. Additional information regarding the Firms capital ratios and the federal regulatory capital standards to which it is subject is presented in Regulatory developments on pages 910 and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 192193 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 on pages 273274 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Basel II
The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I). In 2004, the Basel Committee published a revision to the Accord (Basel II). The goal of the Basel II Framework is to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. U.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II rule in December 2007, which requires
JPMorgan Chase
to implement Basel II at the holding company level, as well as at certain of its key U.S. bank subsidiaries.
Prior to full implementation of the new Basel II Framework,
JPMorgan Chase
is required to complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters during which it needs to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of its primary U.S. banking regulators.
JPMorgan Chase
is currently in the qualification period and expects to be in compliance with all relevant Basel II rules within the established timelines. In addition, the Firm has adopted, and will continue to adopt, based on various established timelines, Basel II rules in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, as required.
58
Basel III
In addition to the Basel II Framework, on December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Capital Accord, commonly referred to as Basel III, which revised Basel II by, among other things, narrowing the definition of capital, increasing capital requirements for specific exposures, introducing short-term liquidity coverage and term funding standards, and establishing an international leverage ratio. The Basel Committee also announced higher capital ratio requirements under Basel III, which provide that the common equity requirement will be increased to
7%
, comprised of a minimum of
4.5%
plus a
2.5%
capital conservation buffer.
On June 25, 2011, the Basel Committee announced an agreement to require GSIBs to maintain higher Tier 1 common requirements ranging from
1%
to
2.5%
. In addition, the Basel Committee stated it intended to require certain GSIBs to maintain an additional Tier 1 common requirement of
1%
under certain circumstances, to act as a disincentive for the applicable GSIB from taking actions that would further increase its systemic importance. On July 19, 2011, the Basel Committee published a proposal on the GSIB assessment methodology, which reflects an approach based on five broad categories: size; interconnectedness; lack of substitutability; cross-jurisdictional activity; and complexity.
In addition, the U.S. federal banking agencies have published, for public comment, proposed risk-based capital floors pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act to establish a permanent Basel I floor under Basel II and Basel III capital calculations.
The Firm fully expects to be in compliance with the higher Basel III capital standards when they become effective on January 1, 2019, as well as any additional Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements when they are implemented. The Firm estimates that its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules would be
7.6%
as of
June 30, 2011
. Management considers this estimate, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key measure to assess the Firms capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firms capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies.
Estimated Tier 1 common under Basel III rules
The following table presents a comparison of Tier 1 common under Basel I rules to an estimated Tier 1 common (a non-GAAP financial measure) under Basel III rules. Tier 1 common under Basel III includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in Basel I Tier 1 common, such as the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to available-for-sale (AFS) securities and defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans, and the deduction of the Firms defined benefit pension fund assets.
The Firms estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III reflects its current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firms understanding of the Basel III rules are based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies. The Firm intends to maintain its strong liquidity position in the future as the short-term liquidity coverage and term funding standards of the Basel III rules are implemented, in 2015 and 2018, respectively. In order to do so the Firm believes it may need to modify the liquidity profile of certain of its assets and liabilities. Implementation of the Basel III rules may also cause the Firm to increase prices on, or alter the types of, products it offers to its customers and clients.
The Basel III revisions governing liquidity and capital requirements are subject to prolonged observation and transition periods. The observation periods for both the liquidity coverage ratio and term funding standards begin in 2011, with implementation in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The transition period for banks to meet the revised Tier 1 common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with implementation on January 1, 2019. The additional capital requirements for GSIBs will be phased-in starting January 1, 2016, with full implementation on January 1, 2019. The Firm will continue to monitor the ongoing rule-making process to assess both the timing and the impact of Basel III on its businesses and financial condition.

Broker-dealer regulatory capital
JPMorgan Chase
s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMorgan Securities) and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. (JPMorgan Clearing). JPMorgan Clearing is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Securities and provides clearing and settlement services. JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are each subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Net Capital Rule). JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are also registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Effective June 1, 2011, J.P. Morgan Futures Inc., a registered Futures Commission Merchant and a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, merged with and into JPMorgan Securities. The merger created a combined Broker-Dealer / Futures Commission Merchant entity that provides capital and operational efficiencies.
JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing have elected to compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements of the Net Capital Rule. At
June 30, 2011
, JPMorgan Securities net capital, as defined by the Net Capital Rule, was
$11.3 billion
, exceeding the minimum requirement by
$9.8 billion
, and JPMorgan Clearings net capital was
$7.0 billion
, exceeding the minimum requirement by
$5.0 billion
.
In addition to its minimum net capital requirement, JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of
$1.0 billion
and is also required to notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event that tentative net capital is less than
$5.0 billion
, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. As of
June 30, 2011
, JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.
Economic risk capital
JPMorgan Chase
assesses its capital adequacy relative to the risks underlying its business activities, using internal risk-assessment methodologies. The Firm measures economic capital primarily based on four risk factors: credit, market, operational and private equity risk.
Line of business equity
Equity for a line of business represents the amount the Firm believes the business would require if it were operating independently, incorporating sufficient capital to address regulatory capital requirements (including Basel III Tier 1 common capital requirements), economic risk measures and capital levels for similarly rated peers. Capital is also allocated to each line of business for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segments performance. Effective January 1, 2011, capital allocated to
Card
was reduced by
$2.4 billion
, to
$16.0 billion
, largely reflecting portfolio runoff and the improving risk profile of the business; capital allocated to TSS was increased by
$500 million
, to
$7.0 billion
, reflecting growth in the underlying business. The Firm continues to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.

Capital actions
Dividends
On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the Firms quarterly common stock dividend from
$0.05
to
$0.25
per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2011, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2011. The Firms common stock dividend policy reflects
JPMorgan Chase
s earnings outlook; desired dividend payout ratio; capital objectives; and alternative investment opportunities. The Firms current expectation is to return to a payout ratio of approximately
30%
of normalized earnings over time. When management and the Board determine that it is appropriate to consider further increasing the common stock dividend, the Firm expects to review those plans with its regulators before taking action. For a further discussion of the Firms dividend payments, see Dividends on page 106 of
JPMorgan Chase
s

Annual Report
.
Stock repurchases
On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a
$15.0 billion
common equity repurchase program, of which
$8.0 billion
is authorized for repurchase in
2011
. The
$15.0 billion
repurchase program supersedes a
$10.0 billion
repurchase program approved in 2007. During the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm repurchased an aggregate of
80 million
and
82 million
shares, for
$3.5 billion
and
$3.6 billion
, at an average price per share of
$43.33
and
$43.39
, respectively. As of
June 30, 2011
,
$11.4 billion
of authorized repurchase capacity remained, of which
$4.4 billion
of approved capacity remains for use during
2011
. For the
seven
months ended
July 31, 2011
, the Firm has repurchased an aggregate of
99 million
shares for
$4.3 billion
at an average price per share of
$42.91
.
Management and the Board will continue to assess and make decisions regarding alternatives for deploying capital, as appropriate, over the course of the year. Any planned use of the repurchase program beyond the repurchases approved for 2011 will be reviewed by the Firm with banking regulators before taking action. For a further discussion of the Firms stock repurchase program, see Stock repurchases on page 106 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock  for example, during internal trading black-out periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firms equity securities, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, on pages 193194 of this Form 10-Q.
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chases business activities. The Firms risk management framework and governance structure are intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing management of the major risks inherent in its business activities. The Firm employs a holistic approach to risk management to ensure the broad spectrum of risk types are considered in managing its business activities. The Firms risk management framework is intended to create a culture of risk awareness and personal responsibility throughout the Firm where collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information is encouraged.
The Firms overall risk appetite is established in the context of the Firms capital, earnings power, and diversified business model. The Firm employs a formalized risk appetite framework to clearly link risk appetite and return targets, controls and capital management.
There are eight major types of risk identified in the business activities of the Firm: liquidity, credit, market, interest rate, operational, legal and reputation, fiduciary, and private equity risk.
For further discussion of these risks, as well as how they are managed by the Firm, see Risk Management on pages 107109 of JPMorgan Chases

The following discussion of JPMorgan Chases liquidity risk management framework highlights developments since
December 31, 2010
, and should be read in conjunction with pages 110115 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
The ability to maintain surplus levels of liquidity through economic cycles is crucial to financial services companies, particularly during periods of adverse conditions. The Firms funding strategy is intended to ensure liquidity and diversity of funding sources to meet actual and contingent liabilities through both normal and stress periods.
JPMorgan Chases primary sources of liquidity include a diversified deposit base, which was
$1,048.7 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and access to the equity capital markets and long-term unsecured and secured funding sources, including through asset securitizations and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). Additionally, JPMorgan Chase maintains significant amounts of highly-liquid unencumbered assets. The Firm actively monitors the availability of funding in the wholesale markets across various geographic regions and in various currencies. The Firms ability to generate funding from a broad range of sources in a variety of geographic locations and in a range of tenors is intended to enhance financial flexibility and limit funding concentration risk.
Management considers the Firms liquidity position to be strong, based on its liquidity metrics as of
June 30, 2011
, and believes that the Firms unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. The Firm was able to access the funding markets as needed during the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
.
Governance
The Firms governance process is designed to ensure that its liquidity position remains strong. The Asset-Liability Committee reviews and approves the Firms liquidity policy and contingency funding plan. Corporate Treasury formulates and is responsible for executing the Firms liquidity policy and contingency funding plan as well as measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firms liquidity risk profile. JPMorgan Chase centralizes the management of global funding and liquidity risk within Corporate Treasury to maximize liquidity access, minimize funding costs and enhance global identification and coordination of liquidity risk. This centralized approach involves frequent communication with the business segments, disciplined management of liquidity at the parent holding company, comprehensive market-based pricing of all assets and liabilities, continuous balance sheet monitoring, frequent stress testing of liquidity sources, and frequent reporting to and communication with senior management and the Board of Directors regarding the Firms liquidity position.
Liquidity monitoring
The Firm employs a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. One set of analyses used by the Firm relates to the timing of liquidity sources versus liquidity uses (e.g., funding gap analysis and parent holding company funding, as discussed below). A second set of analyses focuses on measurements of the Firms reliance on short-term unsecured funding as a percentage of total liabilities, as well as the relationship of short-term unsecured funding to highly-liquid assets, the deposits-to-loans ratio and other balance sheet measures.
The Firm performs regular liquidity stress tests as part of its liquidity monitoring activities. The purpose of the liquidity stress tests is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Firm under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions. These scenarios measure the Firms liquidity position across a full-year horizon by analyzing the net funding gaps resulting from contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows versus the Firms ability to generate additional liquidity by pledging or selling excess collateral and issuing unsecured debt. The scenarios are produced for the parent holding company and major bank subsidiaries as well as the Firms major U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries.
The Firm currently has liquidity in excess of its projected full-year liquidity needs under both the idiosyncratic stress scenario (which evaluates the Firms net funding gap after a short-term ratings downgrade to A-2/P-2), as well as under the systemic market stress scenario (which evaluates the Firms net funding gap during a period of severe market stress similar to market conditions in 2008 and assumes that the Firm is not uniquely stressed versus its peers).
Parent holding company
Liquidity monitoring of the parent holding company takes into consideration regulatory restrictions that limit the extent to which bank subsidiaries may extend credit to the parent holding company and other nonbank subsidiaries. Excess cash generated by parent holding company issuance activity is used to purchase liquid collateral through reverse repurchase agreements or is placed with both bank and nonbank subsidiaries in the form of deposits and advances to satisfy a portion of subsidiary funding requirements. The Firms liquidity management is also intended to ensure that its subsidiaries have the ability to generate replacement funding in the event the parent holding company requires repayment of the aforementioned deposits and advances.
The Firm closely monitors the ability of the parent holding company to meet all of its obligations with liquid sources of cash or cash equivalents for an extended period of time without access to the unsecured funding markets. The Firm targets pre-funding of parent holding company obligations for at least 12 months; however, due to conservative liquidity management actions taken by the Firm in the current environment, the current pre-funding of such obligations is significantly greater than target.
62
Global Liquidity Reserve
In addition to the parent holding company, the Firm maintains a significant amount of liquidity  primarily at its bank subsidiaries, but also at its nonbank subsidiaries. The Global Liquidity Reserve represents consolidated sources of available liquidity to the Firm, including cash on deposit at central banks, and cash proceeds reasonably expected to be received in secured financings of highly liquid, unencumbered securities  such as government-issued debt, government- and FDIC-guaranteed corporate debt, U.S. government agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The liquidity amount estimated to be realized from secured financings is based on managements current judgment and assessment of the Firms ability to quickly raise secured financings. The Global Liquidity Reserve also includes the Firms borrowing capacity at various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks from collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although considered as a source of available liquidity, the Firm does not view borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a primary source of funding. As of
June 30, 2011
, the Global Liquidity Reserve was estimated to be approximately
$404 billion
, compared with approximately $262 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase in the Global Liquidity Reserve reflected a higher level of balances due from Federal Reserve Banks, predominantly driven by overall growth in wholesale clients cash management activities during the first six months of 2011 and an increase in inflows of short-term wholesale deposits from TSS clients toward the end of June 2011.
In addition to the Global Liquidity Reserve, the Firm has significant amounts of other high-quality, marketable securities available to raise liquidity, such as corporate debt and equity securities.
Funding
Sources of funds
A key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through the RFS, CB, TSS and AM lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and decreases reliance on the wholesale markets. As of
June 30, 2011
, total deposits for the Firm were
$1,048.7 billion
, compared with
$930.4 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. Average total deposits for the Firm were
$979.9 billion
and $878.6 billion for the three months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively, and were
$955.3 billion
and $878.0 billion for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. The Firm typically experiences higher customer deposit inflows at period-ends. A significant portion of the Firms deposits are retail deposits (
36%
and
40%
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively), which are considered particularly stable as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility. A significant portion of the Firms wholesale deposits are also considered to be stable sources of funding due to the nature of the relationships from which they are generated, particularly customers operating service relationships with the Firm. As of
June 30, 2011
, the Firm's deposits-to-loans ratio was
152%
, compared with
134%
at
December 31, 2010
. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the results for the Firms business segments and the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 1748 and 4951, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Additional sources of funding include a variety of unsecured and secured short-term and long-term instruments. Short-term unsecured funding sources include federal funds and Eurodollars purchased, certificates of deposit, time deposits, commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Long-term unsecured funding sources include long-term debt, preferred stock and common stock.
The Firms short-term secured sources of funding consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco FHLBs. Secured long-term funding sources include asset-backed securitizations, and borrowings from the Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco FHLBs.
Funding markets are evaluated on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate global balance of unsecured and secured funding at favorable rates.
Short-term funding
The Firms reliance on short-term unsecured funding sources is limited. Short-term unsecured funding sources include federal funds and Eurodollars purchased, which represent overnight funds; certificates of deposit; time deposits; commercial paper, which is generally issued in amounts not less than $100,000 and with maturities of 270 days or less; and other borrowed funds, which consist of demand notes, term federal funds purchased, and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less.
Total commercial paper liabilities were
$51.2 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$35.4 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
. However, of those totals,
$43.5 billion
and
$29.2 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, originated from deposits that customers chose to sweep into commercial paper liabilities as a cash management product offered by the Firm. Therefore, commercial paper liabilities sourced from wholesale funding markets were
$7.7 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$6.2 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
; in addition, the average balance of commercial paper liabilities sourced from wholesale funding markets were
$7.4 billion
and
$7.9 billion
for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, respectively.
Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, generally mature between one day and three months, are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt, agency debt and agency MBS. The balances of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, which constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, was
$252.6 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$273.3 billion
63
as of
December 31, 2010
; the average balance was $277.4 billion and $274.3 billion for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, respectively. At
June 30, 2011
, the decline in the balance, compared with the balance at
December 31, 2010
, and the average balances for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, was driven by lower financing of the Firm's trading assets as well as lower client financing balances. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers investment and financing activities; the Firms demand for financing; the Firms matched book activity; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firms liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment and trading portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors. For additional information, see the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 4951, Note 12 on page 133 and Note 18 on page 164 of this Form 10-Q.
Total other borrowed funds was
$30.2 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$34.3 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
; the average balance of other borrowed funds was $36.9 billion and $35.2 billion for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, respectively. At
June 30, 2011
, the decline in the balance, compared with the balance at
December 31, 2010
, and the average balances for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, was predominantly driven by lower financing of the Firm's trading assets, and maturities of short-term unsecured bank notes and short-term FHLB advances.
Long-term funding and issuance
During the three months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm issued
$18.8 billion
of long-term debt, including
$12.9 billion
of senior notes issued in the U.S. market,
$1.4 billion
of senior notes issued in non-U.S. markets, and
$4.5 billion
of IB structured notes. In addition, in July 2011, the Firm issued $2.3 billion of senior notes in the U.S. market. During the three months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm issued
$7.1 billion
of long-term debt, including
$1.3 billion
of senior notes issued in U.S. markets,
$1.5 billion
of trust preferred capital debt securities, and
$4.3 billion
of IB structured notes. During the three months ended
June 30, 2011
,
$11.4 billion
of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, including
$4.5 billion
of IB structured notes. During the three months ended
June 30, 2010
,
$16.2 billion
of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, including
$5.4 billion
of IB structured notes.
During the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm issued
$31.8 billion
of long-term debt, including
$19.9 billion
of senior notes issued in the U.S. market,
$4.1 billion
of senior notes issued in non-U.S. markets, and
$7.8 billion
of IB structured notes. During the six months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm issued $18.0 billion of long-term debt, including $6.9 billion of senior notes issued in U.S. markets, $904 million of senior notes issued in non-U.S. markets, $1.5 billion of trust preferred capital debt securities and $8.7 billion of IB structured notes. During the six months ended
June 30, 2011
,
$29.5 billion
of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, including
$10.1 billion
of IB structured notes. During the six months ended
June 30, 2010
, $30.3 billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, including $12.8 billion of IB structured notes.
In addition to the unsecured long-term funding and issuances discussed above, the Firm securitizes consumer credit card loans, residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans for funding purposes. During the three months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm securitized $1.0 billion of credit card loans, and $3.2 billion of loan securitizations matured or were redeemed, including $3.0 billion of credit card loan securitizations, $39 million of residential mortgage loan securitizations and $77 million of student loan securitizations. During the three months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm did not securitize any loans through consolidated or nonconsolidated securitization trusts for funding purposes, and $6.8 billion of loan securitizations matured or were redeemed, including $6.6 billion of credit card loan securitizations, $47 million of residential mortgage loan securitizations, $72 million of student loan securitizations, and $36 million of auto loan securitizations.
During the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm securitized $1.0 billion of credit card loans, and $9.8 billion of loan securitizations matured or were redeemed, including $9.6 billion of credit card loan securitizations, $83 million of residential mortgage loan securitizations and $153 million of student loan securitizations. During the six months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm did not securitize any loans through consolidated or nonconsolidated securitization trusts for funding purposes, and $13.5 billion of loan securitizations matured or were redeemed, including $13.2 billion of credit card loan securitizations, $90 million of residential mortgage loan securitizations, $156 million of student loan securitizations, and $75 million of auto loan securitizations.
In addition, the Firms wholesale businesses securitize loans for client-driven transactions and those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm. For the three months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, $265 million and $352 million, respectively, of client-driven loan securitizations matured or were redeemed. For the six months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, $277 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, of client-driven loan securitizations matured or were redeemed. For further discussion of loan securitizations, see Note 16 on pages 159163 in this Form 10-Q.
During the three months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm did not borrow from FHLBs and there were $5 million of maturities. For the three months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm borrowed
$1.0 billion
from FHLBs, which were more than offset by
$5.0 billion
of maturities. During the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm borrowed
$4.0 billion
from FHLBs, which were partially offset by
$2.5 billion
of maturities. For the six months ended
June 30, 2010
, the Firm borrowed
$2.5 billion
from FHLBs, which were more than offset by
$13.5 billion
of maturities.
64
Cash flows
Cash and due from banks was
$30.5 billion
and
$32.8 billion
at
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. These balances increased by
$2.9 billion
from
December 31, 2010
and
$6.6 billion
from
December 31, 2009
, respectively. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected JPMorgan Chases cash flows for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and June 30,
2010
, respectively.
Cash flows from operating activities
JPMorgan Chases operating assets and liabilities support the Firms capital markets and lending activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities, and market conditions. Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and the Firms ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firms operating liquidity needs.
For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, net cash provided by operating activities was
$58.7 billion
. This resulted from a decrease in trading assets  debt and equity instruments, driven by client market-making activity in IB, primarily due to declines in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and equity securities, partially offset by an increase in non-U.S. government debt securities; a decrease in trading assets  derivative receivables largely due to a reduction in foreign exchange derivatives partially offset by an increase in equity derivatives from IBs market-making activity; and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities largely due to higher IB Prime Services customer balances. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds were a decrease in trading liabilities  derivatives payable largely due to the aforementioned reduction of the foreign exchange derivatives partially offset by the increase in equity derivatives; and an increase in accrued interest and accounts receivable largely reflecting higher receivables from securities transactions pending settlement. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income largely as a result of adjustments for noncash items such as the provision for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Additionally, cash provided by proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originated or purchased with an initial intent to sell was slightly higher than cash used to acquire such loans, and also reflected a higher level of activity over the prior-year period.
For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2010
, net cash provided by operating activities was
$45.7 billion
, primarily driven by an increase in trading liabilities, reflecting an increase in business activity in markets outside of the U.S., mainly Asia/Pacific, in the first quarter of 2010, partially offset by a decrease in trading assets driven by lower client flows as a result of unfavorable financial markets in the second quarter of 2010. Also, net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income, largely as a result of adjustments for non-cash items such as the provision for credit losses, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. Proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originated or purchased with an initial intent to sell were higher than cash used to acquire such loans.
Cash flows from investing activities
The Firms investing activities predominantly include loans originated to be held for investment, the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term interest-earning assets. For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, net cash of
$145.8 billion
was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting a higher level of deposit balances at Federal Reserve Banks predominantly the result of an overall growth in wholesale clients' cash management activities in the first six months of 2011, as well as an increase in inflows of short-term wholesale deposits from TSS clients toward the end of June 2011, and an increase in wholesale loans reflecting growth in client activity in all of the Firms wholesale businesses. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were a decline in securities purchased under resale agreements, predominantly in IB, reflecting lower client financing activity; a decrease in credit card loans in Card reflecting lower seasonal balances, higher repayment rates, continued runoff of the Washington Mutual portfolio and the sale of the Kohls portfolio; and a decrease in loans in RFS reflecting paydowns, portfolio runoff and repayments.
For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2010
, net cash of
$73.7 billion
was provided by investing activities. This resulted from a decrease in deposits with banks largely due to a decline in deposits placed with the Federal Reserve Bank and lower interbank lending as market stress had gradually eased since the end of 2009; a net decrease in the loan portfolio, driven by a decline in credit card loans due to the runoff of the Washington Mutual portfolio and a decrease in lower-yielding promotional loans; continued runoff of the residential real estate portfolios in RFS; and repayments and loan sales in IB and continued low client demand for wholesale loans; and proceeds from sales and maturities of AFS securities used in the Firms interest rate risk management activities being higher than cash used to acquire such securities.
Cash flows from financing activities
The Firms financing activities primarily reflect cash flows related to taking customer deposits, and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and common stock. For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, net cash provided by financing activities was
$89.3 billion
. This was largely driven by a significant increase in deposits predominantly as a result of an overall growth in wholesale clients' cash management activities during the first six months of 2011, an increase in inflows of short-term wholesale deposits from TSS clients toward the end of June 2011, and growth in the number of clients and higher balances in CB, AM and RFS (the RFS deposits were net of the attrition related to inactive and low-balance Washington Mutual accounts); an increase in commercial
65
paper and other borrowed funds due to growth in the volume of liability balances in sweep accounts related to TSSs cash management product; and a modest incremental increase in commercial paper issued in wholesale funding markets. Cash was used to reduce securities sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly in IB, due to lower financings of the Firms trading assets as well as lower client financing balances; for net repayments of long-term borrowings, including a decline in long-term beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs due to maturities of Firm-sponsored credit card securitization transactions; for repurchases of common stock and payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock.
In the first
six
months of
2010
, net cash used in financing activities was
$112.3 billion
. This resulted from a decline in deposits associated with wholesale funding activities reflecting the Firms lower funding needs; a decline in TSS deposits reflecting the normalization of deposit levels, offset partially by net inflows from existing customers and new business in AM, CB and RFS; net repayment of long-term borrowings, including a decline in long-term beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs due to maturities of Firm-sponsored credit card securitization transactions and a decline in long-term advances from FHLBs due to maturities; payments of cash dividends; and repurchases of common stock. Additionally, cash was used as a result of a decline in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements largely due to reduced funding requirements associated with lower AFS securities in Corporate and reduced short-term funding requirements in IB.
Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firms access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firms funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see Special-purpose entities on page 52, and Note 5 on pages 117124, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.
The credit ratings of the parent holding company and each of the Firms significant banking subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2011
, were as follows.
The senior unsecured ratings from Moodys, S&P and Fitch on JPMorgan Chase and its principal bank subsidiaries remained unchanged at June 30, 2011, from December 31, 2010. At June 30, 2011, Moodys outlook was negative, while S&Ps and Fitchs outlook was stable.
On July 18, 2011, Moodys placed the long-term debt ratings of the Firm and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade. The Firms current long-term debt ratings by Moodys reflect support uplift above the Firms stand-alone financial strength due to Moodys assessment of the likelihood of U.S. government support. Moodys action was directly related to Moodys placing the U.S. governments Aaa rating on review for possible downgrade on July 13, 2011. Moodys indicated that the action did not reflect a change to Moodys opinion of the Firms stand-alone financial strength. The short-term debt ratings of the Firm and its subsidiaries were affirmed and were not affected by the action. Subsequently, on August 3, 2011, Moodys confirmed the long-term debt ratings of the Firm and its subsidiaries at their current levels and assigned a negative outlook on the ratings. The rating confirmation was directly related to Moodys confirmation on August 2, 2011, of the Aaa rating assigned to the U.S. government.
If the Firms senior long-term debt ratings were downgraded by one notch or two notches, the Firm believes its cost of funds would increase; however, the Firms ability to fund itself would not be impacted. JPMorgan Chases unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firms credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.
Several rating agencies have announced that they will be evaluating the effects of the financial regulatory reform legislation in order to determine the extent, if any, to which financial institutions, including the Firm, may be negatively impacted. There is no assurance the Firms credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future as a result of any such reviews.
66
For a further discussion on the Firms credit risk management framework, see pages 116118 of JP Morgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
The following table presents JPMorgan Chases credit portfolio as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. Total credit exposure was
$1.8 trillion
at
June 30, 2011
, an increase of
$711 million
from
December 31, 2010
, reflecting increases in the wholesale portfolio of
$37.4 billion
offset by decreases in the consumer portfolio of
$36.7 billion
. During the first
six
months of
2011
, increases in lending-related commitments of
$7.3 billion
were offset by decreases in loans and derivative receivables of
$3.2 billion
and
$3.1 billion
, respectively.
The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of more than
$990 billion
for it's clients during the first
six
months of 2011. The Firm also originated mortgages to more than
360,000
people; provided credit cards to approximately
4.6 million
people; lent or increased credit to more than
16,800
small businesses; lent to more than
800
not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities; extended or increased loan limits to approximately
3,000
middle market companies; and lent to or raised capital for more than
5,000
other corporations. The Firm is the #1 Small Business Administration lender in the U.S. with more loans made than any other lender. In 2009 and 2010, the Firm lent more than $7 billion and $10 billion, respectively, to small businesses, and has committed to lend at least $12 billion in 2011. The Firm remains committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures. Since the beginning of 2009, the Firm has offered 1,177,000 trial modifications to struggling homeowners.
In the table below, reported loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale (which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with changes in value recorded in noninterest revenue); and loans accounted for at fair value. For additional information on the Firms loans and derivative receivables, including the Firms accounting policies, see Note 13 and Note 5 on pages 134148 and 117124, respectively, of this Form 10-Q, and Note 14 and Note 6 on pages 220238 and 191199, respectively, of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report. Average retained loan balances are used for net charge-off rate calculations.
67
single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. Because the Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing.
As of
June 30, 2011
, wholesale exposure (IB, CB, TSS and AM) increased by
$37.4 billion
from
December 31, 2010
. The overall increase was primarily driven by increases of
$21.2 billion
in loans and
$19.6 billion
in lending-related commitments, partly offset by a decrease of
$3.1 billion
in derivative receivables. The growth in wholesale credit exposure represented increased client activity across all businesses and all regions. Effective January 1, 2011, the commercial card credit portfolio (composed of approximately $5.3 billion of lending-related commitments and $1.2 billion of loans) that was previously in TSS was transferred to Card.
68
The following table presents summaries of the maturity and ratings profiles of the wholesale portfolio as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. The ratings scale is based on the Firms internal risk ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by S&P and Moodys. Also included in this table is the notional value of net credit derivative hedges; the counterparties to these hedges are predominantly investment-grade (IG) banks and finance companies.
Wholesale credit exposure  maturity and ratings profile
Receivables from customers of
$32.5 billion
at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, primarily representing margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients and are included in the previous tables. These margin loans are collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients brokerage accounts and are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements. In the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. If additional collateral is not provided by the client, the clients position may be liquidated by the Firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements.
69
Wholesale credit exposure  selected industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile similar to a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and lower, as defined by S&P and Moodys, respectively. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, decreased to
$18.3 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, from
$22.4 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease was primarily related to net repayments and loan sales.
Below are summaries of the top 25 industry exposures as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.

71
The following table presents the geographic distribution of wholesale credit exposure including nonperforming assets and past due loans as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. The geographic distribution of the wholesale portfolio is determined based predominantly on the domicile of the borrower.
Loans
In the normal course of business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of wholesale customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators, see Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q.
Retained wholesale loans were
$244.2 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$222.5 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The
$21.7 billion
increase was primarily related to
increased client activity.
The Firm actively manages wholesale credit exposure through sales of loans and lending-related commitments. During the first
six
months of
2011
, the Firm sold
$2.8 billion
of loans and commitments, recognizing net gains of
$16 million
. During the first
six
months of
2010
, the Firm sold
$4.9 billion
of loans and commitments, recognizing net gains of
$31 million
. These results included gains or losses on sales of nonaccrual loans, if any, as discussed below. These sale activities are not related to the Firms securitization activities. For further discussion of securitization activity, see Liquidity Risk Management and Note 15 on pages 6266 and 151159 respectively, of this Form 10-Q.
72
The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
.
Nonaccrual wholesale loans decreased by
$2.4 billion
from
December 31, 2010
, primarily reflecting net repayments and loan sales.
The following table presents net charge-offs, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans.
Derivative contracts
In the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activity. Derivatives enable customers and the Firm to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its credit exposure. For further discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 5 on page 117124 of this Form 10-Q.
The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables MTM for the periods presented.
Derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were
$77.4 billion
and
$80.5 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. These represent the fair value (i.e., MTM) of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements, cash collateral held by the Firm and the CVA. However, in managements view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also reflect additional liquid securities and other cash collateral held by the Firm of
$16.5 billion
at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, as shown in the table above. Derivative receivables decreased from December 31, 2010, largely due to a reduction in foreign exchange derivative balances, partially offset by an increase in equity derivatives, from IBs market-making activity.
73
The Firm also holds additional collateral delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Though this collateral does not reduce the balances noted in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the MTM of the clients derivative transactions move in the Firms favor. As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm held
$22.3 billion
and
$18.0 billion
, respectively, of this additional collateral. The derivative receivables MTM, net of all collateral, also do not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firms use of collateral agreements, see Note 5 on pages 117124 of this form 10-Q.
The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firms derivative receivables MTM, net of other liquid securities collateral, for the dates indicated.
Ratings profile of derivative receivables MTM
As noted above, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firms derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements  excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity  remained at
88%
as of
June 30, 2011
, unchanged compared with
December 31, 2010
. The Firm posted
$57.9 billion
and
$58.3 billion
of collateral at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
Credit derivatives
For a detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including types of derivatives, see Note 5, Credit derivatives, on pages 117124 of this Form 10-Q, and Credit derivatives on pages 126127 and Note 6, Credit derivatives, on pages 197199 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
The following table presents the Firms notional amounts of credit derivatives protection purchased and sold as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, distinguishing between dealer/client activity and credit portfolio activity.
Dealer/client business
Within the dealer/client business, the Firm actively manages credit derivatives by buying and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, according to client demand. For further information, see Note 5 on pages 117124 of this Form 10-Q.
At
June 30, 2011
, the total notional amount of protection purchased and sold increased by
$633 billion
from
December 31, 2010
, primarily due to increased activity, particularly in the EMEA region.
74
Credit portfolio activities
The credit derivatives used by JPMorgan Chase for credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firms view, of the true changes in value of the Firms overall credit exposure. The MTM value related to the Firms credit derivatives used for managing credit exposure, as well as the MTM value related to the CVA (which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure) are included in the gains and losses realized on credit derivatives disclosed in the table below. These results can vary from period to period due to market conditions that affect specific positions in the portfolio.
Lending-related commitments
JPMorgan Chase uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of these contracts.
Wholesale lending-related commitments were
$365.7 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$346.1 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, reflecting increased client activity.
In the Firms view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firms actual credit risk exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the Firm has established a loan-equivalent amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. The loan-equivalent amounts of the Firms lending-related commitments were
$194.7 billion
and
$178.9 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
Country exposure
The Firms wholesale portfolio includes country risk exposures to both developed and emerging markets. The Firm seeks to diversify its country exposures, including its credit-related lending, derivative, trading and investment activities, whether cross-border or locally funded.
Country exposure under the Firms internal risk management approach is reported based on the country where the assets of the obligor, counterparty or guarantor are located or where the majority of the revenue is derived, and includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Exposure amounts include the fair value of derivative receivables and consider credit derivative protection sold and bought, based on the country of the referenced obligation. Exposure amounts, including resale agreements, are adjusted for collateral received by the Firm, for credit enhancements (e.g., guarantees and letters of credit) provided by third parties and for credit derivative protection purchased (which can be either name-specific or sovereign-referenced).  Exposures supported by a guarantor located outside the country are generally assigned to the country of the enhancement provider.   For trading and investment activities, other short credit or equity trading positions are taken into consideration.
75
Several European countries, including Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland, have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations. The Firm is closely monitoring its exposures in these countries. As of
June 30, 2011
, aggregate net exposures to these five countries as measured under the Firms internal approach was approximately $
14 billion
.  Sovereign exposure in all five countries represented approximately
26%
of the aggregate net exposure, with the majority of the sovereign exposure in Spain. The Firms exposure to corporate clients in all five countries represented approximately
62%
of the aggregate net exposure. The Firms exposure to the banking sector represented approximately
12%
.
The Firm currently believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the Firms overall risk exposures and is manageable given the size and types of exposures to each of the countries and the diversification of the aggregate exposure. Net exposure is adjusted for liquid collateral held, of which approximately
90%
consists of cash and non-sovereign collateral. In addition, predominately all of the credit derivative protection is purchased from investment-grade counterparties domiciled outside of these countries. 
The Firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and, therefore, the Firms aggregate net exposures and sector distribution may vary over time. In addition, the net exposures may be affected by changes in market conditions, including the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations.
As part of its ongoing country risk management process, the Firm monitors exposure to emerging market countries, and utilizes country stress tests to measure and manage the risk of extreme loss associated with a sovereign crisis in one or more countries. There is no common definition of emerging markets, but the Firm generally includes in its definition those countries whose sovereign debt ratings are equivalent to A+ or lower. The table below presents the Firms exposure to its top 10 emerging markets countries based on its internal measurement approach. The selection of countries is based solely on the Firms largest total exposures by country and does not represent its view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.

JPMorgan Chases consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, auto loans, student loans and business banking loans. The Firms primary focus is on serving the prime consumer credit market. For further information on the consumer loans, see Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q.
A substantial portion of the consumer loans acquired in the September 2008 Washington Mutual transaction were identified as purchased credit-impaired based on an analysis of high-risk characteristics, including product type, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO scores and delinquency status. These PCI loans are accounted for on a pool basis, and the pools are considered to be performing. For further information on PCI loans see Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 220238 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
The credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire product spectrum has improved, particularly in credit card, but high unemployment and weak overall economic conditions continued to result in an elevated number of residential real estate loans that charge-off, while weak housing prices continued to negatively affect the severity of loss recognized on residential real estate loans that default. Both early-stage residential real estate delinquencies (3089 days delinquent) and late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) have declined in 2011 but remained elevated. The elevated level of the late-stage delinquent loans is due, in part, to loss-mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Losses related to these loans continued to be recognized in accordance with the Firms standard charge-off practices, but some delinquent loans that would otherwise have been foreclosed upon remain in the mortgage and home equity loan portfolios. Ongoing weak economic conditions, combined with elevated delinquencies and ongoing discussions regarding mortgage foreclosure-related matters with federal and state officials, continue to result in a high level of uncertainty in the residential real estate portfolio.
The Firm has taken actions since the onset of the economic downturn in 2007 to tighten underwriting and loan qualification standards and to eliminate certain products and loan origination channels, which have resulted in the reduction of credit risk and improved credit performance for recent loan vintages.
77
The following table presents managed consumer credit-related information (including RFS, Card and residential real estate loans reported in the Corporate/Private Equity segment) for the dates indicated. For further information about the Firms nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 220238 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
78
respectively, that are 90 or more days past due; and (2) student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP of
$558 million
and
$625 million
, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due. These amounts were excluded as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally. In addition, the Firms policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. Under guidance issued by the FFIEC, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier.
Consumer, excluding credit card
Loan balances declined during the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, due to paydowns, portfolio run-off and charge-offs. Credit performance has improved across most portfolios but remains under stress. The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-related categories. PCI loans are generally excluded from individual loan product discussions and are addressed separately below.
Home equity:
Home equity loans at
June 30, 2011
, were
$82.8 billion
, compared with
$88.4 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease in this portfolio primarily reflected loan paydowns and charge-offs. Senior lien nonaccrual loans remained relatively flat compared with December 31, 2010, while junior lien nonaccrual loans increased slightly. Early-stage delinquencies modestly improved from December 31, 2010, while net charge-offs improved from the same period of the prior year.
Approximately 20% of the Firm's owned home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (HELOANs) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 330 years. Approximately half of the HELOANs are senior liens and the remainder are junior liens. In general, HELOCs are open-ended, revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or where collateral does not support the loan amount. Because the majority of the HELOCs were funded in 2005 or later, a fully-amortizing payment is not required for the most significant portion of the HELOC portfolio until 2015 or after. The Firm regularly evaluates both the near-term and longer-term repricing risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses and account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio risk profile.
At June 30, 2011, the Firm estimates that its home equity portfolio contained approximately
$4 billion
of junior lien loans where the borrower has a first mortgage loan that is either delinquent or has been modified. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than that of junior lien loans for which the senior lien is neither delinquent nor modified. Of this estimated $4 billion balance, the Firm owns less than 5% and services approximately 30% of the related senior lien loans to these same borrowers; in these cases, the Firm knows whether the senior lien loan is either delinquent or modified. In the other cases where the Firm neither owns nor services the senior lien loan, the Firm estimates the amount of higher-risk junior lien loans. The performance of the Firm's junior lien loans is otherwise materially consistent regardless of whether the Firm owns, services or does not service the senior lien. The increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.
Mortgage:
Mortgage loans at
June 30, 2011
, including prime, subprime and loans held-for-sale, were
$84.9 billion
, compared with
$86.0 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns, portfolio run-off and charge-offs on delinquent loans, partially offset by prime mortgage originations. Net charge-offs decreased from the same period in the prior year but remained elevated.
Prime mortgages, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and loans held-for-sale at
June 30, 2011
, were
$74.5 billion
, compared with
$74.7 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. Such loans were relatively unchanged from December 31, 2010, as charge-offs on delinquent loans, paydowns, and portfolio run-off of option ARM loans were offset by prime mortgage originations. Excluding loans insured by U.S. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies showed modest improvement during the first half of the year but remained elevated. Nonaccrual loans showed improvement, but also remained elevated as a result of ongoing foreclosure processing delays. Net charge-offs declined year over year but remained high.
Option ARM loans, which are included in the prime mortgage portfolio, were
$7.9 billion
and
$8.1 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and December 31, 2010, respectively, and represented
11%
of the prime mortgage portfolio in both periods. The decrease in option ARM loans resulted from portfolio run-off, partially offset by the repurchase of loans previously securitized as the securitization entities were terminated. The Firms option ARM loans, other than those held in the PCI portfolio, are primarily loans with lower LTV ratios and higher borrower FICOs. Accordingly, the Firm expects substantially lower losses on this portfolio when compared with the PCI option ARM pool. As of
June 30, 2011
, approximately
6%
of option ARM borrowers were delinquent,
4%
were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments, and
90%
were making amortizing payments. Approximately
84%
of borrowers within the portfolio are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast, as a limited number of these loans have been modified. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance due to negative
79
amortization of option ARMs was not material at either
June 30, 2011
, or
December 31, 2010
. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM loans will experience a recast that results in a payment increase:
$29 million
in
2011
,
$297 million
in 2012 and
$981 million
in 2013. The Firm did not originate option ARMs and new originations of option ARMs were discontinued by Washington Mutual prior to the date of JPMorgan Chases acquisition of its banking operations.
Subprime mortgages at
June 30, 2011
, were
$10.4 billion
, compared with
$11.3 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease was due to portfolio run-off and charge-offs on delinquent loans. Both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies improved from December 2010. However, delinquencies and nonaccrual loans remained at elevated levels. Net charge-offs improved significantly from the same period in the prior year.
Auto:
Auto loans at
June 30, 2011
, were
$46.8 billion
, compared with
$48.4 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. Loan balances declined due to the impact of increased competition. Delinquent and nonaccrual loans have decreased. Net charge-offs declined from the prior year as a result of lower delinquencies and a decline in loss severity due to a strong used-car market nationwide. The auto loan portfolio reflected a high concentration of prime-quality credits.
Business banking:
Business banking loans at
June 30, 2011
, were
$17.1 billion
, compared with
$16.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The increase was due to growth in new loan origination volumes. These loans primarily include loans that are collateralized, often with personal loan guarantees, and may also include Small Business Administration guarantees. Delinquent loans and nonaccrual loans showed some improvement, but remain elevated. Net charge-offs declined from the prior year.
Student and other:
Student and other loans at
June 30, 2011
, were
$14.8 billion
, compared with
$15.3 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease was due to paydowns in student loans. Other loans primarily include other secured and unsecured consumer loans. Delinquencies and nonaccrual loans remained elevated, while charge-offs decreased from the prior-year quarter.
Purchased credit-impaired loans:
PCI loans at
June 30, 2011
, were
$69.0 billion
, compared with
$72.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. This portfolio represents loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition.
The Firm regularly updates the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected for these loans. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased principal credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, with any remaining increase in the expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans.
At both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firms allowance for loan losses for the home equity, prime mortgage, subprime mortgage and option ARM PCI pools was
$1.6 billion
,
$1.8 billion
,
$98 million
and
$1.5 billion
, respectively.
Approximately
36%
of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent,
4%
were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments, and
60%
were making amortizing payments. Approximately
34%
of current borrowers are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast; substantially all of the remaining loans have been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option ARM PCI pool was
$1.2 billion
and
$1.4 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM PCI loans will experience a recast that results in a payment increase:
$547 million
in
2011
,
$2.4 billion
in 2012 and
$501 million
in 2013.
The following table provides a summary of lifetime loss estimates included in both the nonaccretable difference and the allowance for loan losses. Principal charge-offs will not be recorded on these pools until the nonaccretable difference has been fully depleted.

Geographic composition and current LTVs of residential real estate loans
The consumer credit portfolio is geographically diverse. California has the greatest concentration of residential real estate loans with
24%
of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. Of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans,
$82.7 billion
, or
54%
, were concentrated in California, New York, Arizona, Florida and Michigan at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$86.4 billion
, or
54%
, at
December 31, 2010
.
The current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was
83%
at both
June 30, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
. Excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans,
24%
of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and
10%
of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 125% at both
June 30, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
. The decline in home prices since 2007 has had a significant impact on the collateral value underlying the Firms residential real estate loan portfolio. In general, the delinquency rate for loans with high LTV ratios is greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has equity in the collateral. While a large portion of the loans with current estimated LTV ratios greater than 100% continue to pay and are current, the continued willingness and ability of these borrowers to pay remains uncertain.
The following table presents the current estimated LTV ratio, as well as the ratio of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value, for PCI loans. Because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratio of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated LTV ratio, which is based on the unpaid principal balance. The estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
LTV ratios and ratios of carrying values to current estimated collateral values  PCI loans
PCI loans in the states of California and Florida represented
53%
and
10%
, respectively, of total PCI loans at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. The current estimated average LTV ratios were
118%
and
140%
for California and Florida loans, respectively, at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
118%
and
135%
, respectively, at
December 31, 2010
. Continued pressure on housing prices in California and Florida have contributed negatively to both the current estimated average LTV ratio and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the PCI portfolio. Of the PCI portfolio, at both
June 30, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
,
63%
had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and
31%
had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 125%.
While the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of PCI loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing. For further information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of residential real estate  non-PCI and PCI loans, see Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q.
81
Loan modification activities
For additional information about consumer loan modification activities, including consumer loan modifications accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), see Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 139140 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
Residential real estate loans:
For both the Firms onbalance sheet loans and loans serviced for others, more than
1,177,000
mortgage modifications have been offered to borrowers and approximately
375,000
have been approved since the beginning of
2009
. Of these, approximately
355,000
have achieved permanent modification as of
June 30, 2011
. Of the remaining
802,000
offered modifications,
27%
are in a trial period or still being reviewed for a modification, while
73%
have dropped out of the modification program or otherwise were not eligible for final modification.
The Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasurys Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs and is continuing to expand its other loss-mitigation efforts for financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the U.S. Treasurys programs. The MHA programs include the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP). The Firms other loss-mitigation programs for troubled borrowers who do not qualify for HAMP include the traditional modification programs offered by the GSEs and Ginnie Mae, as well as the Firms proprietary modification programs, which include concessions similar to those offered under HAMP but with expanded eligibility criteria. In addition, the Firm has offered modification programs targeted specifically to borrowers with higher-risk mortgage products.
MHA, as well as the Firms other loss-mitigation programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers, including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions, and deferral or forgiveness of principal payments that would have otherwise been required under the terms of the original agreement. For the
81,300
onbalance sheet loans modified under HAMP and the Firms other loss-mitigation programs since July 1, 2009,
53%
of permanent loan modifications have included interest rate reductions,
57%
have included term or payment extensions,
12%
have included principal deferment and
22%
have included principal forgiveness. Principal forgiveness has been limited to specific modification programs to higher-risk borrowers. The sum of the percentages of the types of loan modifications exceeds 100%, because in some cases, the modification of an individual loan includes more than one type of concession.
Generally, borrowers must make at least three payments under the new terms during a trial modification period and be successfully re-underwritten with income verification before a mortgage or home equity loan can be permanently modified. When the Firm modifies home equity lines of credit, future lending commitments related to the modified loans are canceled as part of the terms of the modification.
The ultimate success of these modification programs and their impact on reducing credit losses remains uncertain given the short period of time since modification. The primary indicator used by management to monitor the success of these programs is the rate at which the modified loans redefault. Modification redefault rates are affected by a number of factors, including the type of loan modified, the borrowers overall ability and willingness to repay the modified loan and other macroeconomic factors. Reduction in payment size for a borrower has shown to be the most significant driver in improving redefault rates. Modifications completed after July 1, 2009, whether under HAMP or under the Firms other modification programs, differ from modifications completed under prior programs in that they are generally fully underwritten after a successful trial payment period of at least three months. Performance metrics to date for modifications seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of
20%
and
28%
for HAMP and the Firms other modification programs, respectively. These redefault rates exclude certain recent modifications that were offered to borrowers who were current on their loans prior to modification, but who were subject to future payment recast risk. The weighted average default rate for such modifications that have seasoned more than six months was 5%. While the redefault rates for HAMP and the Firms other modification programs compare favorably to equivalent metrics for modifications completed under programs in effect prior to July 1, 2009, ultimate redefault rates remain uncertain until modified loans have seasoned.
The following table presents information as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, relating to restructured onbalance sheet residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of PCI loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the Firms quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. Modifications of consumer loans other than PCI loans are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs.

Restructured residential real estate loans
Foreclosure prevention:
Foreclosure is a last resort, and the Firm makes significant efforts to help borrowers stay in their homes. Since the
second
quarter of
2009
, the Firm has prevented two foreclosures (through loan modification, short sales, and other foreclosure prevention means) for every foreclosure completed.
The Firm has a well-defined foreclosure prevention process when a borrower fails to pay on his or her loan. Customer contacts are attempted multiple times in various ways to pursue options other than foreclosure. In addition, if the Firm is unable to contact a customer, various reviews are completed of a borrowers facts and circumstances before a foreclosure sale is completed. By the time of a foreclosure sale, borrowers have not made a payment on average for more than 14 months.
The foreclosure process is governed by laws and regulations established on a state-by-state basis. In some states, the foreclosure process involves a judicial process requiring filing documents with a court. In other states, the process is mostly non-judicial, involving various processes, some of which require filing documents with governmental agencies. During the third quarter of
2010
, the Firm became aware that certain documents executed by Firm personnel in connection with the foreclosure process may not have complied with all applicable procedural requirements. As a result, the Firm instructed its outside foreclosure counsel to temporarily suspend foreclosures, foreclosure sales and evictions in 43 states so that it could review its processes. These matters are the subject of investigation by federal and state officials. For further discussion, see Mortgage Foreclosure Investigations and Litigation in Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q.
As of
June 30, 2011
, the Firm has resumed initiation of new foreclosure proceedings in nearly all states in which it had previously suspended such proceedings.

Nonperforming assets
The following table presents information as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, about consumer, excluding credit card nonperforming assets.
Nonperforming assets
 
(a)
Nonaccrual loans:
Total consumer, excluding credit card nonaccrual loans, were
$8.4 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$8.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. Nonaccrual loans have stabilized, but remained at elevated levels. The increase in loan modification activities is expected to continue to result in elevated levels of nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolios as a result of both redefault of modified loans as well as the Firms policy that modified loans remain in nonaccrual status until repayment is reasonably assured and the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms or three payments subsequent to permanent modification if trial modification payments were made. Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled
$7.4 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, of which
71%
were greater than 150 days past due; this compared with nonaccrual residential real estate loans of
$7.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
, of which
71%
were greater than 150 days past due. Modified residential real estate loans of
$1.7 billion
and
$1.3 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, were classified as nonaccrual loans. Of these modified residential real estate loans,
$938 million
and
$580 million
had yet to make six payments under their modified terms at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, with the remaining nonaccrual modified loans having redefaulted. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately
48%
and
46%
to estimated collateral value at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
Real estate owned (REO):
REO assets, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, decreased by
$338 million
from
December 31, 2010
, to
$956 million
at
June 30, 2011
.
Enhancements to Mortgage Servicing
During the second quarter of 2011, the Firm entered into Consent Orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. In their Orders, the regulators have mandated significant changes to the Firms servicing and default business and outlined requirements to implement these changes. In accordance with the requirements of the Consent Orders, the Firm submitted a comprehensive action plan setting forth the steps necessary to ensure the Firms residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Orders. In addition, the Firm has undertaken remedial actions to ensure that it satisfies all requirements relating to mortgage servicing, foreclosures and loss-mitigation activities outlined in the Consent Orders. These corrective actions, which the Firm intends to implement over the course of this year, include:
84
loss-mitigation and loan modification.
In addition, pursuant to the Consent Orders, the Firm is required to enhance oversight of its mortgage servicing activities, including compliance, management and audit and, accordingly, is making changes in its organization structure, control oversight and customer service practices, which include:
Additionally, pursuant to the Consent Orders, the Firm has retained an independent consultant to conduct a review of its residential foreclosure actions during the period from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010 (including foreclosure actions brought in respect to loans being serviced), and to remediate any errors or deficiencies identified by the independent consultant, including, if required, by reimbursing borrowers for any identified financial injury they may have incurred. The identification of residential mortgage loans serviced by the Firm in which a foreclosure action was initiated is in process and will be provided to the Independent Consultant. The borrower outreach process is being developed. For additional information, see Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q.
Credit Card
Total credit card loans were
$125.5 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, a decrease of
$12.2 billion
from
December 31, 2010
, due to seasonality, higher repayment rates, runoff of the Washington Mutual portfolio and the Firm's sale of the $3.7 billion Kohl's portfolio on April 1, 2011.
For the retained credit card portfolio, the 30 plus day delinquency rate decreased to
2.98%
at
June 30, 2011
, from
4.14%
at
December 31, 2010
; and the net charge-off rate decreased to
5.82%
for the three months ended
June 30, 2011
, from
10.20%
for the three months ended June 30, 2010. For the six months ended
June 30, 2011
and 2010, the respective net charge-off rates were
6.40%
and
10.99%
. The delinquency trend is showing improvement, especially within early-stage delinquencies. Charge-offs have improved as a result of lower delinquent loans. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, largely rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. The greatest geographic concentration of credit card retained loans is in California, which represented
13%
of total retained loans at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. Loan concentration for the top five states of California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois consisted of
$50.5 billion
in receivables, or
40%
of the retained loan portfolio, at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$54.4 billion
, or
40%
, at
December 31, 2010
.
Total retained credit card loans, excluding the Washington Mutual portfolio, were
$113.8 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$121.8 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The 30 plus day delinquency rate was
2.71%
at
June 30, 2011
, down from
3.73%
at
December 31, 2010
, and the net charge-off rate decreased to
5.23%
for the
three
months ended
June 30, 2011
, from
9.02%
for the three months ended June 30, 2010. For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and 2010, the respective net charge-off rates were
5.77%
and
9.80%
.
85
Retained credit card loans in the Washington Mutual portfolio were
$11.8 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, compared with
$13.7 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The Washington Mutual portfolios 30 plus day delinquency rate was
5.53%
at
June 30, 2011
, down from
7.74%
at
December 31, 2010
. The respective net charge-off rates for the
three
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, were
11.28%
and
19.53%
, and for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, the respectively net charge-off rate was
12.16%
and
20.10%
.
Modifications of credit card loans
For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Modifications of credit card loans on pages 137138 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm had
$8.5 billion
and
$10.0 billion
, respectively, of onbalance sheet credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from
December 31, 2010
, to
June 30, 2011
, was primarily attributable to
a
reduction in new modifications, with ongoing payments or charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans also contributing to the decrease. The Firm expects that a significant portion of the borrowers whose loans have been modified will not ultimately comply with the modified payment terms. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average ultimate default rates for modified credit card loans were
37.40%
at June 30, 2011, and
36.45%
at December 31, 2010.
Consistent with the Firms policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status. However, the Firm establishes an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed and accrued interest and fee income on credit card loans, which is reflected as a charge to interest income.
The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. JPMorgan Chase is a national leader in community development by providing loans, investments and community development services in communities across the United States.
At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firms CRA loan portfolio was approximately
$15 billion
and
$16 billion
, respectively. At
June 30, 2011
, and December 31, 2010,
65%
, respectively, of the CRA portfolio were residential mortgage loans at both periods;
16%
and
15%
, respectively, were business banking loans;
13%
and
14%
, respectively, were commercial real estate loans; and
6%
, respectively, were other loans at both periods. CRA nonaccrual loans were
6%
of the Firms nonaccrual loans at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were
3%
and
2%
, respectively, of the Firms net charge-offs for the
three
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. For the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, the net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were
3%
and
2%
, respectively, of the Firm's net charge-offs.
JPMorgan Chases allowance for loan losses covers the wholesale (risk-rated), and consumer (primarily scored) portfolios. The allowance represents managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firms loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and consumer (excluding credit card) lending-related commitments using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loans.
For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 9295 and Note 14 on pages 149150 of this Form 10-Q.
At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of the Firm and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of
June 30, 2011
, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio).
The allowance for credit losses was
$29.1 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, a decrease of
$3.8 billion
from
$33.0 billion
at
December 31, 2010
.
The
credit card allowance for loan losses decreased by
$3.0 billion
from
December 31, 2010
, primarily as a result of lower estimated losses. The wholesale allowance for loan losses decreased by
$670 million
from
December 31, 2010
, primarily related to the impact of loan sales and net repayments.
The allowance for lending-related commitments for both the wholesale and consumer excluding, credit card, portfolios which is reported in other liabilities, totaled
$626 million
and
$717 million
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
86
The credit ratios in the table below are based on retained loan balances, which exclude loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for at fair value.
Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses
87
Provision for credit losses
For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, the provision for credit losses was
$1.8 billion
and $3.0 billion, respectively, down
46%
and 71%, respectively from the prior year periods. The consumer, excluding credit card, provision for credit losses was
$1.1 billion
and $2.4 billion, down
35%
and 55%, respectively, from the prior year periods, reflecting improving delinquency and charge-off trends in 2011 across most portfolios. The credit card provision for credit losses was
$810 million
and $1.0 billion, down
64%
and 82%, respectively, from the prior year periods, driven primarily by improved delinquency and net credit loss trends. The credit card three and six months provision also benefited from a reduction in the allowance for loan losses for both the prior and current year periods. The wholesale provision for credit losses had lower benefits of
$117 million
and $503 million, compared with benefits of
$572 million
and $808 million in the prior-year periods, primarily reflecting continued improvement in the credit environment from the year-ago period. The current-quarter benefit reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, primarily due to net repayments.

2010
Annual Report.
Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves. Each business day, as part of its risk management activities, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VaR calculation that includes the majority of its material market risks. VaR provides a consistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels of diversification and is used for comparing risks across businesses and monitoring limits. These VaR results are reported to senior management and regulators, and they are utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
The Firm calculates VaR to estimate possible economic outcomes for its current positions using historical simulation, which measures risk across instruments and portfolios in a consistent, comparable way. The simulation is based on data for the previous 12 months. This approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. VaR is calculated using a one day time horizon and an expected tail-loss methodology, and approximates a 95% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to incur losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates five times in every 100 trading days, or about 12 to 13 times a year. The Firms VaR calculation is highly granular and incorporates numerous risk factors, which are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio.
88
The table below shows the results of the Firms VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.
Total IB trading VaR by risk type, credit portfolio VaR and other VaR
VaR Measurement
IB trading VaR includes substantially all trading activities in IB, including the credit spread sensitivities of certain mortgage products and syndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these products since daily time series are largely not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. In addition, for certain products included in IB trading and credit portfolio VaR, particular risk parameters are not fully captured  for example, correlation risk.
Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and mark-to-market (MTM) hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. However, Credit portfolio VaR does not include the retained portfolio, which is not MTM.
Other VaR includes certain positions employed as part of the Firms risk management function within the Chief Investment Office (CIO) and in the
Mortgage Production and Servicing
business. CIO VaR includes positions, primarily in debt securities and credit products, used to manage structural and other risks including interest rate, credit and mortgage risks arising from the Firms ongoing business activities.
Mortgage Production and Servicing
VaR includes the Firms mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs and all related hedges.
As noted above, IB, Credit portfolio and other VaR does not include the retained credit portfolio, which is not marked to market; however, it does include hedges of those positions. It also does not include debit valuation adjustments (DVA) taken on derivative and structured liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the Firm, principal investments (mezzanine financing, tax-oriented investments, etc.), and certain securities and investments held by the Corporate/Private Equity line of business, including private equity investments, capital management positions and longer-term investments managed by CIO. These longer-term positions are managed through the Firms earnings at risk and other cash flow monitoring processes, rather than by using a VaR measure. Principal investing activities and Private Equity positions are managed using stress and scenario analyses. See the DVA Sensitivity table on page 91 of this Form 10-Q for further details. For a discussion of Corporate/Private Equity, see pages 4647 of this Form 10-Q.

2011
VaR results
As presented in the table, average total IB and other VaR increased slightly for the three months ended June 30, 2011, when compared with the respective 2010 period. This increase was driven by a reduction in the Firms average IB and other VaR diversification benefit. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, average total IB and other VaR decreased for the comparable 2010 period. This decrease was driven by reduced market volatility as well as position changes.
Average total IB trading and credit portfolio VaR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, decreased compared with the respective 2010 periods. These decreases were driven primarily by reduced market volatility as well as position changes.
CIO VaR and
Mortgage Production and Servicing VaR
for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2011, decreased for the comparable 2010 periods. The decreases in CIO and
Mortgage Production and Servicing VaR
also were driven by reduced market volatility as well as position changes.
The Firms average IB and other VaR diversification benefit was $44 million or 32% of the sum for the three months ended June 30, 2011, compared with $79 million or 46% of the sum for the three months ended June 30, 2010. The Firms average IB and other VaR diversification benefit was $51 million or 36% of the sum for the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared with $73 million or 43% of the sum for the six months ended June 30, 2010. In general, over the course of the year, VaR exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.
VaR back-testing
The Firm conducts daily back-testing of VaR against its market risk-related revenue, which is defined as the change in value of: principal transactions revenue for IB and CIO (less Private Equity gains/losses and revenue from longer-term CIO investments); trading-related net interest income for IB, CIO and
Mortgage Production and Servicing
; IB brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue; revenue from syndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute; and mortgage fees and related income for the Firms mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs, and all related hedges. Daily firmwide market risk-related revenue excludes gains and losses from DVA.
The following histogram illustrates the daily market risk-related gains and losses for IB, CIO and
Mortgage Production and Servicing
positions for the first six months of 2011. The chart shows that the Firm posted market risk-related gains on 127 of the 129 days in this period, with four days exceeding $200 million. The inset graph looks at those days on which the Firm experienced losses and depicts the amount by which the VaR exceeded the actual loss on each of those days. Losses were sustained on two days during the six months ended June 30, 2011, none of which exceeded the VaR measure.
90
The following table provides information about the gross sensitivity of DVA to a one-basis-point increase in JPMorgan Chases credit spreads. This sensitivity represents the impact from a one-basis-point parallel shift in JPMorgan Chases entire credit curve. As credit curves do not typically move in a parallel fashion, the sensitivity multiplied by the change in spreads at a single maturity point may not be representative of the actual revenue recognized.
Debit valuation adjustment sensitivity
Economic-value stress testing
While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing captures the Firms exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates or commodity prices. Scenarios are updated dynamically and may be redefined on an ongoing basis to reflect current market conditions. Along with VaR, stress testing is important in measuring and controlling risk; it enhances understanding of the Firms risk profile and loss potential, as stress losses are monitored against limits. Stress testing is also employed in cross-business risk management. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the Firms senior management and to the lines of business to allow them to better understand event risk-sensitive positions and manage risks with more transparency.
Nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk (i.e., earnings-at-risk)
Interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risk exposures. This risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The Firm manages this interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and related derivatives. The Firm evaluates its nontrading interest rate risk exposure through the stress testing of earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the Firm's net interest income and interest rate-sensitive fees (nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue). Earnings-at-risk excludes the impact of trading activities and MSRs as these sensitivities are captured under VaR. For further discussion on interest rate exposure, see Earnings-at-risk stress testing on pages 145146 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
The Firm conducts simulations of changes in nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in this revenue, and the corresponding impact to the Firm's pretax earnings, over the following 12 months. These tests highlight exposures to various interest rate-sensitive factors, such as the rates themselves (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The tests include forecasted balance sheet changes, such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience and forward market expectations. The balance and pricing assumptions of deposits that have no stated maturity are based on historical performance, the competitive environment, customer behavior, and product mix.
Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk, and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed. These scenarios include the implied forward curve, nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates. These scenarios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase's earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes.
JPMorgan Chases 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profiles.
(Excludes the impact of trading activities and MSRs)
91
The change in earnings at risk from
December 31, 2010
, resulted from investment portfolio repositioning and an assumed higher level of deposit balances. The Firms risk to rising rates was largely the result of widening deposit margins, which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates.
Additionally, under another interest rate scenario used by the Firm  involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels  results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of
$980 million
. The increase in earnings under this scenario is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.

Dividends
At
June 30, 2011
, JPMorgan Chases banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate,
$4.1 billion
in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.
JPMorgan Chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firms critical accounting estimates involving significant valuation judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
JPMorgan Chases allowance for credit losses covers the retained wholesale and consumer loan portfolios, as well as the Firms wholesale and consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the Firms loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable losses in the lending-related commitments portfolio. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firms allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 149150 and Note 15 on pages 239243 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report; for amounts recorded as of
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 8688 and Note 14 on pages 149150 of this Form 10-Q.
As noted in the discussion on page 149 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report, the Firms allowance for credit losses is sensitive to several factors, depending on the portfolio. The Firms consumer loan portfolio is sensitive to changes in the economic environment, delinquency status, the realizable value of collateral, FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors, while the Firms wholesale loan portfolio is sensitive to the estimated credit quality of individual loans, as expressed in the assigned risk ratings. Significant judgment is required to estimate the allowance for credit losses for each portfolio segment, considering all relevant factors. For example, the credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire consumer credit product spectrum has improved, particularly in credit card, but high unemployment and weak overall economic conditions continued to result in an elevated number of residential real estate loans that charge-off, and weak housing prices continued to negatively affect the severity of losses recognized on residential real estate loans that default. Significant judgment is required to estimate the duration and
92
severity of the recent economic downturn, as well as its potential impact on housing prices and the labor market. Ongoing weak economic conditions, combined with elevated delinquencies and ongoing discussions regarding mortgage foreclosure-related matters with federal and state officials, continue to result in a high level of uncertainty in the residential real estate portfolio.
Changes in economic conditions or in the Firms assumptions could affect the Firms estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For example, deterioration in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firms loss estimates as of
June 30, 2011
, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firms allowance for loan losses:
The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on credit loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply managements expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors.
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows in evaluating the risk factors related to its loans, including risk ratings, home price assumptions, and credit card loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit loss is appropriate.
Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventory
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including loans accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value that are only subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
93
Valuation
For instruments classified within level 3 of the hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value may be significant. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs  including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. In addition to market information, models also incorporate transaction details, such as maturity. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firms creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, where relevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For further discussion of changes in level 3 assets, see Note 3 on pages 102114 of this Form 10-Q.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of revenue or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 170187 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
Purchased credit-impaired loans
In connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and for which it was probable, at acquisition, that the Firm would be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable. These loans are considered to be PCI loans and are accounted for as described in Note 14 on pages 220238 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report. The application of the accounting guidance for PCI loans requires a number of significant estimates and judgments, such as determining: (i) which loans are within the scope of PCI accounting guidance, (ii) the fair value of the PCI loans at acquisition, (iii) how loans are aggregated to apply the guidance on accounting for pools of loans, and (iv) estimates of cash flows to be collected over the term of the loans. For additional information on PCI loans, including the significant assumptions, estimates and judgment involved, see PCI loans on pages 152153 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report and Note 14 on pages 149150 of this Form 10-Q.
As of
June 30, 2011
, the carrying value of the aggregate portfolio of PCI loans incorporates assumptions about home prices derived from a nationally recognized home price index; this index reflects a further 5% decline in housing prices based on the geographic distribution of the PCI portfolio. An adverse home price scenario (reflecting an additional 5% decline in housing prices beyond that already assumed) could imply an increase in credit loss estimates for these loans of approximately
$1.5 billion
.
Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment on page 153 of JPMorgan Chases
2010
Annual Report.
During the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuations of certain consumer lending businesses in RFS and
Card
, which continue to have elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of these businesses include (a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on portfolio outstanding balances, net interest margin, operating expense, credit losses and the amount of capital necessary given the risk of business activities to meet regulatory capital requirements), and (b) the cost of equity used to discount those cash flows to a present value. Each of these factors requires significant judgment and the assumptions used are based on management's best estimate and most current projections, including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, derived from the Firm's business forecasting process reviewed with senior management. These projections are consistent with the short-term assumptions discussed in the Business Outlook on pages 89 of this Form 10-Q, and, in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm's best estimates of long-term growth and returns of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.
94
In addition, for its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes) and prior projections of business performance. Based upon the updated valuations for its consumer lending businesses and reviews of its other businesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units was not impaired at 
June 30, 2011
. However, the fair value of the Firm's consumer lending businesses in RFS and
Card
each exceeded their carrying values by less than 15% and the associated goodwill of such lines of business remains at an elevated risk of impairment due to each businesses' exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes.
Deterioration in economic market conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected business performance beyond managements current expectations. For example, in RFS, such declines could result from increases in costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increased credit losses, including decreases in home prices beyond management's current expectations. In
Card
, declines in business performance could result from deterioration in economic conditions such as increased unemployment claims or bankruptcy filings that result in increased credit losses or changes in customer behavior that cause decreased account activity or receivable balances. Such declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
For additional information on goodwill, see Note 16 on pages 159163 of this Form 10-Q.

Fair value measurements and disclosures
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires new disclosures, and clarifies existing disclosure requirements, about fair value measurements. The clarifications and the requirement to separately disclose transfers of instruments between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are effective for interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009; the Firm adopted this guidance in the first quarter of
2010
. For additional information about the impact of the adoption of the new fair value measurements guidance, see Note 3 on pages 102114 of
this Form 10-Q
. In addition, a new requirement to provide purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the level 3 rollforward on a gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The Firm adopted the new guidance, effective January 1, 2011.
In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance that amends the requirements for fair value measurement and disclosure. The guidance changes and clarifies certain existing requirements related to portfolios of financial instruments and valuation adjustments and requires additional disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (including disclosure of the range of inputs used in certain valuations) and for financial instruments that are not carried at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2012. The Firm is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.
Disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses
In July 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures surrounding the credit characteristics of the Firms loan portfolio. Under the new guidance, the Firm is required to disclose its accounting policies; the methods it uses to determine the components of the allowance for credit losses; and qualitative and quantitative information about the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, including additional information on certain types of loan modifications. For the Firm, the new disclosures, other than those related to loan modifications, became effective for the
2010
Annual Report
. For additional information, see Notes 13 and 14 on pages 134148 and 149150 of
this Form 10-Q
. The adoption of this guidance only affected
JPMorgan Chase
s disclosures of financing receivables and not its Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. New disclosures regarding TDRs will become effective for the 2011 third quarter.
Determining whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring
In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance to clarify existing standards for determining whether a restructuring represents a TDR from the perspective of the creditor. The guidance is effective in the third quarter of
2011
and must be applied retrospectively to January 1, 2011. The Firm does not expect that the implementation of this new guidance will have a significant impact on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Accounting for repurchase and similar agreements
In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance that amends the criteria used to assess whether repurchase and similar agreements should be accounted for as financings or sales (purchases) with forward agreements to repurchase (resell). Specifically, the guidance eliminates circumstances in which the lack of adequate collateral maintenance requirements could result in a repurchase agreement being accounted for as a sale. The guidance is effective for new transactions or existing transactions that are modified beginning January 1, 2012. The Firm has accounted for its repurchase and similar agreements as secured financings, and therefore, the Firm does not expect the application of this guidance will have an impact on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Presentation of other comprehensive income
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the presentation of other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The guidance requires that items of net income, items of other comprehensive income, and total comprehensive income be presented in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. For public companies the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The application of this guidance will only affect the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and will have no impact on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
96
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chases current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chases disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Firms senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firms control. JPMorgan Chases actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements:
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (
JPMorgan Chase
 or the Firm), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (U.S.), with operations in more than
60
countries. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm's business-segment information, see Note 24 on pages 180182 of this Form 10Q.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorgan Chase
and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.
These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase
s
Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2010
, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as retrospectively revised by the Current Report on Form 8K filed with the SEC on November 4, 2011.
References to the 2010 Annual Report or 2010 Form 10-K in this Form 8K are to the Firms 2010 Form 10K, as retrospectively revised by the Form 8K filed on November 4, 2011.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
NOTE 2  BUSINESS CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS
Increase in common stock dividend
On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors raised the Firms quarterly common stock dividend from
$0.05
to
$0.25
per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2011, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2011.
Stock repurchases
On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a
$15.0 billion
common equity repurchase program, of which
$8.0 billion
is authorized for repurchase in 2011. The
$15.0 billion
repurchase program supersedes a
$10.0 billion
repurchase program approved in 2007. The
$15.0 billion
authorization includes shares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the Firms employee stock-based incentive plans.
The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.

NOTE 3  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
For a further discussion of the Firms valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 on pages 170187 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
During the first
six
months of
2011
, no changes were made to the Firms valuation models that had, or were expected to have, a material impact on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
The following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.
102
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

104
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firms risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

and
2010
, and were
$434 million
and
$(65) million
for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. Unrealized gains / (losses) reported on AFS securities in OCI were
$(8) million
and
$(42) million
for the three months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, and were
$148 million
and
$(107) million
for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the reporting period.
The method used to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate, nonfinancial assets) underlying the loan. Fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices, broker quotes or independent appraisals. For further information, see Note 14 on pages 149150 of this Form 10-Q.
Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three- and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, related to financial instruments held at those dates.
110
(a) Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Level 3 analysis
Level 3 assets at
June 30, 2011
, predominantly include derivative receivables, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) held within the AFS securities portfolio, loans and asset-backed securities in the trading portfolio and private equity investments.
Consolidated Balance Sheets changes
Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were
5%
of total Firm assets at
June 30, 2011
. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2010.
For the
three
months ended
June 30, 2011
Level 3 assets were

Credit adjustments
When determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuation adjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are not limited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firms own creditworthiness. The markets view of the Firms credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the credit default swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, see Note 3 on pages 170187
of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.
The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financial instruments not carried at fair value)
The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 on pages 170187

.
The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
113
The majority of the Firms lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firms wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.
The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law.

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.
At both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was
$3.8 billion
, with a corresponding fair value of
$(6) million

Annual Report
.
Notional amount of derivative contracts
The following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firms derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firms view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.
117
Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
The following tables summarize information on derivative fair values that are reflected on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.
Free-standing derivatives
 
(a)
Derivative receivables and payables fair value
The following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables, including those designated as hedges, by contract type and after netting adjustments as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
118
Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income
Fair value hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
119
Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and
six
months ended June 30,
2011
and
2010
, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
120
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that
$96 million
(after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at
June 30, 2011
, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
10
years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.
Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
.
Risk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)
The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated in hedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. These derivatives are risk management instruments used to mitigate or transform market risk exposures arising from banking activities other than trading activities, which are discussed separately below.
121
Trading derivative gains and losses
The following table presents trading derivatives gains and losses, by contract type, that are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. The Firm has elected to present derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with the cash instruments with which they are risk managed.
Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
The aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingent collateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was
$15.4 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, for which the Firm has posted collateral of
$11.2 billion
in the normal course of business. At
June 30, 2011
, the impact of a single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), would have required
$1.4 billion
and
$2.8 billion
, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted by the Firm. In addition, at
June 30, 2011
, the impact of single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts with termination triggers would have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of
$430 million
and
$930 million
, respectively.
The following tables show the carrying value of derivative receivables and payables after netting adjustments and adjustments for collateral held and transferred as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
122
Credit derivatives
For a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the different types used by the Firm, see Note 6 on pages 191199 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.
The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firms view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities
The following table presents a rollforward for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income, related to debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.
Gross unrealized losses
Gross unrealized losses have generally decreased since
December 31, 2010
, but those that have been in unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased slightly. As of
June 30, 2011
, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of
June 30, 2011
.
Following is a description of the Firms principal investment securities with the most significant unrealized losses that have been existing for 12 months or more as of
June 30, 2011
, and the key assumptions used in the Firms estimate of the present value of the cash flows most likely to be collected from these investments.
Mortgage-backed securities  Prime and Alt-A nonagency
As of
June 30, 2011
, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were
$180 million
, of which
$179 million
related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Approximately
58%
of the total portfolio (by amortized cost) are currently rated below investment-grade; the Firm has recorded OTTI losses on
66%
of the below investment-grade positions. The majority of OTTI has been attributed to securities that are primarily backed by mortgages with higher credit risk characteristics based on collateral type, vintage and geographic concentration. The remaining securities that are below investment-grade that have not experienced OTTI generally either do not possess all of these characteristics or have sufficient credit enhancements to protect the investment. The average credit enhancements associated with the below investment-grade and investment-grade positions are
8%
and
44%
, respectively. In analyzing prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses, the Firm uses a methodology that focuses on loan-level detail to estimate future cash flows, which are then allocated to the various tranches of the securities. The loan-level analysis primarily considers current home value, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, loan type and geographical location of the underlying property to forecast prepayment, home price, default rate and loss severity. The forecasted weighted average underlying default rate on the positions was
24%
, and the related weighted average loss severity was
47%
. Based on this analysis, an OTTI loss of
$13 million
and
$43 million
was recognized for the three months and six months ended
June 30, 2011
, respectively, on certain securities related to higher loss assumptions. Overall unrealized losses have decreased since
December 31, 2010
, with the recovery in security prices resulting from increased demand for higher-yielding asset classes and a deceleration in the pace of home price declines due in part to the U.S. government programs to facilitate financing and to spur home purchases. The unrealized loss of
$180 million
is considered temporary, based on managements assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firms investment.
130
Mortgage-backed securities  Non-U.S.
As of
June 30, 2011
, gross unrealized losses related to non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities were
$317 million
, of which
$230 million
related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Substantially all of these securities are rated AAA, AA or A and represent mortgage exposures to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The key assumptions used in analyzing non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses include credit enhancements, recovery rates, default rates, and constant prepayment rates. Credit enhancement is primarily in the form of subordination, which is a form of structural credit enhancement where realized losses associated with assets held in an issuing vehicle are allocated to the various tranches of securities issued by the vehicle considering their relative seniority. Credit enhancement in the form of subordination was approximately
10%
of the outstanding principal balance of securitized mortgage loans, compared with expected lifetime losses of
1.5%
of the outstanding principal. In determining potential credit losses, assumptions included recovery rates of
60%
, default rates of
0.25%
to
0.5%
and constant prepayment rates of
15%
to
20%
. The unrealized loss is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.
Asset-backed securities  Collateralized loan obligations
As of
June 30, 2011
, gross unrealized losses related to CLOs were
$117 million
, of which
$113 million
related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Overall losses have decreased since
December 31, 2010
, mainly as a result of lower default forecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securities are rated AAA, AA or A and have an average credit enhancement of
30%
. The key assumptions considered in analyzing potential credit losses were underlying loan and debt security defaults and loss severity. Based on current default trends for the collateral underlying the securities, the Firm assumed collateral default rates of
2%
for the
second
quarter of
2011
, and
4%
thereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be
48%
for loans and
82%
for debt securities. Losses on collateral were estimated to occur approximately
18
months after default. The unrealized loss is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.

this Form 10-Q
for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.
Loan portfolio
The Firms loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Wholesale; Consumer, excluding credit card; and Credit card. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:
and Corporate/Private Equity segments.
134
The following table summarizes the Firms loan balances by portfolio segment:
The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, retained loans sold and retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.
On an on-going basis, the Firm manages its exposure to credit risk. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.
The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.
135
Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers from large corporate and institutional clients to certain high-net worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned each loan. For further information on the risk ratings, see Notes 14 and 15 on pages 220243 of
JPMorgan Chase

Wholesale impaired loans and loan modifications
Wholesale impaired loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on pages 149150 of
this Form 10-Q
.
The table below set forth information about the Firms wholesale impaired loans.
The following table presents the Firms average impaired loans for the periods indicated.
The following table provides information about the Firms wholesale loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). These TDR loans are included as impaired loans in the above tables.
138
Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a primary focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens and mortgage loans with interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers, as well as certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.
Consumer loans, other than PCI loans and the risk-rated loans within the business banking and auto portfolios, are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) policy.
The table below provides information about consumer retained loans by class, excluding the credit card loan portfolio segment.
Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans, excluding credit card. Other indicators that are taken into consideration for consumer loans, excluding credit card, include:
For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 220238 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
Residential real estate  excluding PCI loans
The following tables provide information by class for residential real estate  excluding PCI retained loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment. The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firms residential real estate  excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, the borrower is either unable or unwilling to repay the loan, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at estimated collateral value that remain on the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets.
139
(a) Individual delinquency classifications included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current and less than 30 days past due includes
$3.0 billion
and
$2.5 billion
; 30149 days past due includes
$1.9 billion
and
$2.5 billion
; and 150 or more days past due includes
$8.2 billion
and
$7.9 billion
at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

Residential real estate impaired loans and loan modifications  excluding PCI loans
The Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasurys Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs and is continuing to expand its other loss-mitigation efforts for financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the MHA programs. For further information, see Note 14 on pages 220238 of
JPMorgan Chase
s

.
141
The tables below set forth information about the Firms residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on pages 149150 of
this Form 10-Q
.
The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.
(a) Generally, interest income on loans modified in a TDR is recognized on a cash basis until such time as the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms. As of
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, loans of
$938 million
and
$1.0 billion
, respectively, were TDRs for which the borrowers had not yet made six payments under their modified terms.
142
Other consumer loans
The tables below provide information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.
143
Other consumer impaired loans
The tables below set forth information about the Firms other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and any loan that has been modified in a TDR.
The following table presents average impaired loans.
(a) There were no student and other loans modified in TDRs at
June 30, 2011
and 2010.
(b) The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on cash basis, was not material for the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
.
The following table provides information about the Firms other consumer loans modified in TDRs. These TDR loans are included as impaired loans in the tables above.
144
Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans
For a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 220238 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
Residential real estate  PCI loans
The table below sets forth information about the Firms consumer, excluding credit card PCI loans.
145
The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firms PCI consumer loans for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, and represents the Firms estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. This table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.
The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.
Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expected cash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). Extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time.
146
Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm, including those acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.
The borrowers credit score is another general indicator of credit quality. Because the credit score tends to be a lagging indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not use credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality. For more information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 220238 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders refreshed FICO scores may change over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.
The table below sets forth information about the Firms Credit Card loans.

Annual Report
.
The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.
The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 154 of this Note and on page 253 of

Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities
Credit card securitizations
For a more detailed discussion of
JPMorgan Chase
s involvement with credit card securitizations, see pages 245246 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
As a result of the Firms continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firms primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. The Firm consolidated
$52.7 billion
and
$68.5 billion
of assets held by Firm-sponsored credit-card securitization trusts and
$35.7 billion
and
$44.3 billion
of beneficial interests issued to third parties at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firms other obligations or the claims of the Firms other creditors.
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
For a detailed description of the Firms involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment related to such trusts, see Note 16 on page 246 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement, including those that are consolidated or not consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firms only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. In the table below, the amount of beneficial interests held by
JPMorgan Chase
does not equal the assets held in nonconsolidated VIEs because of the existence of beneficial interests held by third parties, which are reflected at their current outstanding par amounts; and because a portion of the Firms retained interests (trading assets and AFS securities) are reflected at their fair values. See Securitization activity on pages 156158 of this Note for further information regarding the Firms cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs.
151
Re-securitizations
The Firm also engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur to both agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. The Firms consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firms role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
152
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients are seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its client(s), considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
In more limited circumstances, the Firm creates a re-securitization trust independently and not in conjunction with specific clients. In these circumstances, the Firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust because of the decisions made during the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the Firm consolidates the re-securitization VIE if the Firm holds an interest that could potentially be significant.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it wasnt involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, the Firm consolidated
$357 million
and
$477 million
of assets, and
$155 million
and
$230 million
of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, total assets of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations were
$4.5 billion
and
$3.6 billion
, respectively. During the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, respectively, the Firm transferred
$8.5 billion
and
$17.3 billion
of securities to agency VIEs, and
zero
and
$192 million
of securities to private-label VIEs. During the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2010
, respectively, the Firm transferred
$7.8 billion
and
$14.3 billion
of securities to agency VIEs, and
$663 million
and
$1.0 billion
of securities to private-label VIEs. At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, the Firm held approximately
$2.8 billion
and
$3.5 billion
of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and
$10 million
and
$46 million
of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See pages 158 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs.
Multi-seller conduits
For a more detailed description of
JPMorgan Chase
s principal involvement with Firm-administered, multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 249250 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
As a result of the Firms continuing involvement, the Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest. The Firm consolidated
$22.2 billion
and
$21.7 billion
of assets held by Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and
$22.2 billion
and
$21.6 billion
of beneficial interests in commercial paper issued to third parties at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
The Firm provides deal-specific liquidity as well as program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement to the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm-administered multi-seller conduits then provide certain of their clients with lending-related commitments. The unfunded portion of these commitments was
$11.3 billion
and
$10.0 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, and are included as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 167171 of

December 31, 2010
, respectively. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. The Firm consolidated these vehicles because in its role as secondary market-maker, it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control of certain vehicles.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 253 of

Investment in a third-party credit card securitization trust
The Firm holds two interests in a third-party-sponsored VIE, which is a credit card securitization trust that owns credit card receivables issued by a national retailer. The Firm is not the primary beneficiary of the trust as the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. The Firms interests in the VIEs include investments classified as AFS securities that had a fair value of
$2.9 billion
and
$3.1 billion
, at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, and other interests which are classified as loans and have a fair value of approximately
$1.0 billion
at both
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. For more information on AFS securities and loans, see Notes 11 and 13 on pages 128132 and 134148, respectively, of

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities
The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
Supplemental information on loan securitizations
The Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.
155
Securitization activity
The following tables provide information related to the Firms securitization activities for the
three
and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, related to assets held in
JPMorgan Chase
-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, as sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. For the three- and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, there were no mortgage loans that were securitized, except for commercial and other, and there were no cash flows from the Firm to the SPEs related to recourse or guarantee arrangements.
156
Loans sold to agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entities
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Agencies). These loans are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. In connection with these loan sales, the Firm makes certain representations and warranties. For additional information about the Firms loan sale- and securitization-related indemnifications, see Note 21 on pages 167171 of
this Form 10-Q
.
For a more detailed description of
JPMorgan Chase
s principal involvement with loans sold to government sponsored agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entities, see Note 16 on page 257 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. government sponsored agencies and third-party sponsored securitization entities.
Repurchased loans and loans subject to an option to repurchase
When the Firm services loans for Ginnie Mae, it typically has the option to repurchase certain delinquent loans. The Firm also has similar rights in certain arrangements with other U.S. government agencies. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firms repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the balance sheet as a loan with an offsetting liability. As of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets
$13.2 billion
and
$13.0 billion
, respectively, of loans that either have been repurchased or for which the Firm has an option to repurchase from the Agencies. Predominately all of the amounts presented above relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans sold to the Agencies was
$2.4 billion
and
$1.9 billion
as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and where applicable, reimbursement is proceeding normally. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 134148 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
157
JPMorgan Chase
s interest in securitized assets held at fair value
The following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, of certain of the Firms retained interests in nonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that are valued using modeling techniques. The table also outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
10%
and
20%
adverse changes in assumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 159163 of
this Form 10-Q
.
The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a
10%
or
20%
variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivities also do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.
158
Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses
The table below includes information about delinquencies, liquidation losses and components of off-balance sheet securitized financial assets as of

NOTE 16  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
For a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 17 on pages 260263 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.
Goodwill
The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.
159
The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.
Goodwill was not impaired at
June 30, 2011
, or
December 31, 2010
, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the
six
month periods ended
June 30, 2011
or
2010
. During the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, the Firm reviewed current conditions and prior projections for all of its reporting units. In addition, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuations of its consumer lending businesses in RFS and
Card Services & Auto
(
Card
), as these businesses continue to have elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. As a result of these reviews, the Firm concluded that goodwill for these businesses and the Firms other reporting units was not impaired at
June 30, 2011
.
The Firms consumer lending businesses in RFS and
Card
remain at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of these businesses is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities, and those that may affect consumer credit card use), and the amount of equity capital required. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models were determined using managements best estimates. The cost of equity reflected the related risks and uncertainties, and was evaluated in comparison to relevant market peers. Deterioration in these assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
Mortgage servicing rights
Mortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future fees and ancillary revenues, offset by estimated costs to service the loans. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights naturally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual and ancillary fee income. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Notes 17 on pages 260263, respectively of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
and Note 3 on pages 102114 of
this Form 10-Q
.
In the first half of 2011, the fair value of the MSR declined, primarily due to changes to inputs and assumptions in the MSR valuation model. During the first quarter of 2011, the Firm revised its cost to service assumption to reflect the estimated impact of higher servicing costs to enhance servicing processes, particularly loan modification and foreclosure procedures, including costs to comply with Consent Orders entered into with banking regulators, which resulted in a
$1.1 billion
decrease in the fair value of the MSR asset. The increase in the cost to service assumption contemplates significant and prolonged increases in staffing levels in the core and default servicing functions, and specifically considers the higher cost to service certain high-risk vintages. In addition, the MSR decreased in value due to a decline in interest rates (which tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset). Other than the increased cost to service assumption and the decrease in interest rates, predominantly all of the changes in the fair value of the MSR asset resulted from the largely offsetting impacts of new capitalization and amortization.
The decrease in the fair value of the MSR results in a lower asset value that will amortize in future periods against contractual and ancillary fee income received in future periods. While there is expected to be higher levels of noninterest expense associated with higher servicing costs in those future periods, there will also be less MSR amortization, which will have the effect of increasing mortgage fees and related income. The amortization of the MSR is reflected in the tables below in the row Other changes in fair value.
160
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
.
The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011

.
161
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firms MSRs at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
; and it outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.
CPR: Constant prepayment rate.
The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Other intangible assets
The
$360 million
decrease in other intangible assets during the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
, was predominantly due to
$429 million
in amortization.
The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.
Intangible assets of approximately
$600 million
consisting primarily of asset management advisory contracts, were determined to have an indefinite life and are not amortized.

NOTE 21  OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
JPMorgan Chase
provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firms view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a discussion of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and the Firms related accounting policies, see Note 30 on pages 275280 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale and consumer (excluding credit card) contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on pages 149150 of
this Form 10-Q
for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Offbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
168
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, as well as extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors.
Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were
$7.1 billion
and
$5.9 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 102114 and 114116 respectively, of
this Form 10-Q
.
Guarantees
The Firm considers the following offbalance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the offbalance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 30 on pages 275280
of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
. The recorded amounts of the related to guarantees and indemnifications at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments are discussed on pages 170171 of this Note.
Standby letters of credit
Standby letters of credit (SBLC) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were
$688 million
and
$707 million
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included
$316 million
and
$347 million
, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and
$372 million
and
$360 million
, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.
The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firms customers, as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
In addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 30 on pages 275-280 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was
$84.1 billion
and
$87.8 billion
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firms maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was
$26.2 billion
and
$25.9 billion
and the maximum exposure to loss was
$2.8 billion
and
$2.7 billion
, at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. The fair values of the contracts reflects the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of
$420 million
and
$390 million
and derivative receivables of
$99 million
and
$96 million
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.
169
In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5 on pages 117124 of
this Form 10-Q
, and Note 6 on pages 191199 of
JPMorgan Chase

Annual Report

Loan sale- and securitization-related indemnifications
Indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties
In connection with the Firms loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs and other loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, as described in Notes 13 and 15 on pages 134148 and 151159, respectively, of
this Form 10-Q
, and Notes 14 and 16 on pages 220238 and 244259, respectively of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties; however, predominantly all of the repurchase demands received by the Firm and the Firms losses realized to date are related to loans sold to the GSEs.
The Firm has recognized a repurchase liability of
$3.6 billion
and
$3.3 billion
, as of
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, which is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities net of probable recoveries from third parties.
Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firms established methodology for computing its recorded repurchase liability  including factors such as the amount of probable future demands from purchasers, the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, and recoveries from third parties - require application of a significant level of management judgment. Estimating the repurchase liability is further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors, including: (i) macro-economic factors and (ii) the level of future demands, which is dependent, in part, on actions taken by third parties such as the GSEs and mortgage insurers.
While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of
June 30, 2011
, are reasonably possible. The Firm believes the estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of its established repurchase liability, is from
$0
to approximately
$2.2 billion
at
June 30, 2011
. This estimated range of reasonably possible loss considers the Firm's GSE-related exposure based on an assumed peak to trough decline in home prices of
45%
, which is an additional
11
percentage point decline in home prices beyond the Firms current assumptions, which were derived from a nationally recognized home price index. Although the Firm does not consider such further decline in home prices to be likely to occur, such a decline could increase the level of loan delinquencies, thereby potentially increasing the repurchase demand rate from the GSEs and increasing loss severity on repurchased loans, each of which could affect the Firms repurchase liability. Claims related to private-label securitizations have, thus far, generally manifested themselves through securities-related litigation, which the Firm has considered with other litigation matters as discussed in Note 23 on pages 172179 of this Form 10-Q. Actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the Firms recorded repurchase liability or this estimate of reasonably possible additional losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those considered above.
The following table summarizes the change in the repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.
Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability
170
Loans sold with recourse
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firms securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled
$10.6 billion
and
$11.0 billion
, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firms view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations was
$141 million
and
$153 million
at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, respectively.
NOTE 22  PLEDGED ASSETS AND COLLATERAL
For a discussion of the Firms pledged assets and collateral, see Note 31 on pages 280281 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
Pledged assets
At
June 30, 2011
, assets were pledged to collateralize repurchase agreements, other securities financing agreements, derivative transactions and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, at
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm had pledged
$281.4 billion
and
$288.7 billion
, respectively, of financial instruments it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 on pages 151159 of
this Form 10-Q

Collateral
At
June 30, 2011
, and
December 31, 2010
, the Firm had accepted assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately
$705.2 billion
and
$655.0 billion
, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately
$509.3 billion
and
$521.3 billion
, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. For further information regarding collateral, see Note 31 on page 281 of

NOTE 23  LITIGATION
Contingencies
As of
June 30, 2011
, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in more than 10,000 legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firms lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from
$0
to approximately
$5.1 billion
at
June 30, 2011
. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firms best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firms estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants (including the Firm) in many of such proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims), and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firms estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firms material legal proceedings.
Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation.
Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities. The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008.
The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the New York Attorney Generals Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain auction-rate securities purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMorgan Securities; formerly J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.), Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities and small- to medium-sized businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm has finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney Generals Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totaling
$25 million
to all states. The Firm is currently in the process of finalizing consent agreements with NASAAs member states; more than 45 of these consent agreements have been finalized to date.
The Firm also faces a number of civil actions relating to the Firms sales of auction-rate securities, including a putative securities class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that seeks unspecified damages, and individual arbitrations and lawsuits in various forums brought by institutional and individual investors that, together, seek damages totaling more than
$200 million
relating to the Firms sales of auction-rate securities. One action is brought by an issuer of auction-rate securities. The actions generally allege that the Firm and other firms manipulated the market for auction-rate securities by placing bids at auctions that affected these securities clearing rates or otherwise supported the auctions without properly disclosing these activities. Some actions also allege that the Firm misrepresented that auction-rate securities were short-term instruments. The Firm has filed motions to dismiss each of the actions pending in federal court, which are being coordinated before the federal District Court in New York. These motions are currently pending.
Additionally, the Firm was named in two putative antitrust class actions also pending in the federal District Court in New York. The actions allege that the Firm, along with numerous other financial institution defendants, colluded to maintain and stabilize the auction-rate securities market and then to withdraw their support for the auction-rate securities market. In January 2010, the District Court dismissed both actions. An appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters.
Bear Stearns, certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Management, Inc. (BSAM) and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and certain individuals formerly employed by Bear Stearns are named defendants (collectively the Bear Stearns defendants) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to alleged losses resulting from the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the High Grade Fund) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the Enhanced Leverage Fund) (collectively, the Funds). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands feeder funds that invested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation.
172
There are currently four civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. Two of these actions involve derivative lawsuits brought on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the two U.S. feeder funds, alleging that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds and made material misrepresentations to and/or withheld information from investors in the feeder funds. These actions seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages based on alleged investor losses. The third action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, makes allegations similar to those asserted in the derivative lawsuits related to the U.S. feeder funds, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Motions to dismiss in these three cases have been granted in part and denied in part. An agreement in principle has been reached, pursuant to which BSAM would pay a maximum of approximately
$19 million
to settle the one derivative action relating to the feeder fund to the High Grade Fund. BSAM has reserved the right not to proceed with this settlement if plaintiff is unable to secure the participation of investors whose net contributions meet a prescribed percentage of the aggregate net contributions to the High Grade Fund. The agreement in principle remains subject to documentation and approval by the Court. In the other two actions, the parties are engaging in Court-ordered settlement discussions. Discovery has been limited for the duration of that process. Total alleged losses in these three actions exceed
$1 billion
.
The fourth action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LLC (together BofA) alleging breach of contract and fraud in connection with a May 2007
$4 billion
securitization, known as a CDO-squared, for which BSAM served as collateral manager. This securitization was composed of certain collateralized debt obligation holdings that were purchased by BofA from the Funds. Bank of America seeks in excess of
$3 billion
in damages. Defendants motion to dismiss in this action was largely denied, an amended complaint was filed and discovery is ongoing.
Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters.
Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006, and March 14, 2008 (the Class Period). During the Class Period, Bear Stearns had between
115 million
and
120 million
common shares outstanding, and the price per share of those securities declined from a high of
$172.61
to a low of
$30
at the end of the period. The actions, originally commenced in several federal courts, allege that the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding Bear Stearns business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. Separately, several individual shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced or threatened to commence arbitration proceedings and lawsuits asserting claims similar to those in the putative class actions. Certain of these matters have been dismissed or settled. In addition, Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors have also been named as defendants in a number of purported class actions commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to represent the interests of participants in the Bear Stearns Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) during the time period of December 2006 to March 2008. These actions, brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and to the other participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP by (a) failing to manage prudently the ESOPs investment in Bear Stearns securities; (b) failing to communicate fully and accurately about the risks of the ESOPs investment in Bear Stearns stock; (c) failing to avoid or address alleged conflicts of interest; and (d) failing to monitor those who managed and administered the ESOP.
Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns former executive officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative and class action suit which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount.
All of the above-described actions filed in federal courts were ordered transferred and joined for pre-trial purposes before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants moved to dismiss the purported securities class action, the shareholders derivative action and the ERISA action. In January 2011, the District Court granted the motions to dismiss the derivative and ERISA actions, and denied the motion as to the securities action. Plaintiffs in the derivative action have filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal as well as an appeal. Plaintiffs in the ESOP action have filed a motion to alter the judgment and for leave to amend their amended consolidated complaint. Discovery is ongoing in the securities action.
City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation.
In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the City) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (together, JPMorgan Chase) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the Bond), and (b) an associated swap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the Swap). The City seeks damages and/or other remedies against JPMorgan Chase (among others) on the grounds of alleged fraudulent and deceitful acts and alleged breach of advisory obligations in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The judge has directed four current and former JPMorgan Chase personnel and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
173
N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) to go forward to a full trial that started in May 2010. Although the Firm is not charged with any crime and does not face criminal liability, if one or more of its employees were found guilty, the Firm could be subject to administrative sanctions, including restrictions on its ability to conduct business in Italy and monetary penalties. Hearings have continued on a weekly basis since May 2010.
Enron Litigation.
JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in several lawsuits seeking damages arising out of the Firms banking relationships with Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (Enron). A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm previously were resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enrons bankruptcy estate. The remaining Enron-related actions include individual actions by Enron investors, an action by an Enron counterparty, and a purported class action filed on behalf of JPMorgan Chase employees who participated in the Firms 401(k) plan asserting claims under the ERISA for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by JPMorgan Chase, its directors and named officers. That action has been dismissed, and is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Interchange Litigation.
A group of merchants has filed a series of putative class action complaints in several federal courts. The complaints allege that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks and their respective bank holding companies, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective association rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on the theory that interchange would be lower or eliminated but for the challenged conduct. Based on publicly available estimates, Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards generated approximately
$40 billion
of interchange fees industry-wide in 2009. All cases have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings. The Court has dismissed all claims relating to periods prior to January 2004. The Court has not yet ruled on motions relating to the remainder of the case or plaintiffs class certification motion. Fact and expert discovery have closed.
In addition to the consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints challenging the initial public offerings (IPOs) of MasterCard and Visa (the IPO Complaints). With respect to the MasterCard IPO, plaintiffs allege that the offering violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act and that the offering was a fraudulent conveyance. With respect to the Visa IPO, plaintiffs are challenging the Visa IPO on antitrust theories parallel to those articulated in the MasterCard IPO pleading. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss the IPO Complaints. The Court has not yet ruled on those motions.
The parties also have filed motions seeking summary judgment as to various claims in the complaints.
Investment Management Litigation.
Four cases have been filed claiming that investment portfolios managed by JPMorgan Investment Management Inc. (JPMorgan Investment Management) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by subprime residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMorgan Investment Management and related defendants are liable for losses of more than
$1 billion
in market value of these securities. The first case was filed by NM Homes One, Inc. in federal District Court in New York. Following rulings on motions addressed to the pleadings, plaintiffs claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and gross negligence survive, and discovery is proceeding. In the second case, which was filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) in New York state court, the New York State Appellate Division allowed plaintiff to proceed with its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence, and for breach of contract based on alleged violations of the Delaware Insurance Code. JPMorgan Investment Managements appeal is pending in the New York State Court of Appeals. Discovery is also proceeding. In the third case, filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court, the lower court granted JPMorgan Investment Managements motion to dismiss. The New York State Appellate Division reversed the lower courts decision and is allowing plaintiff to proceed with its claims. The fourth case was filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court. The amended complaint asserts claims under New York law for breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The lower court denied in part defendants motion to dismiss and discovery is proceeding.
Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings.
In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover
$8.6 billion
in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHIs bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s collateral requests hastened LBHIs demise. The Firm has moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint in its entirety. That motion has not yet been decided. The Firm also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than
$25 billion
in claims against the estate of Lehmans broker-dealer, which could be unpaid if the Firm is required to return any collateral to Lehman. Discovery is underway with a trial scheduled for 2012. In addition, in April 2011 the Firm and the SIPA Trustee for LBHIs U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI) announced that they had reached an agreement to return more than
$800 million
in alleged LBI customer assets to the LBI Estate for distribution to its customer claimants. In late June 2011, the Bankruptcy Court approved the agreement. The Firm has also responded to various regulatory inquiries regarding the Lehman matter.
174
Madoff Litigation.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Securities LLC, and JPMorgan Securities Ltd. have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (the Trustee). The Trustee recently served an amended complaint in which he has asserted 28 causes of action against JPMorgan Chase, 20 of which seek to avoid certain transfers (direct or indirect) made to JPMorgan Chase that are alleged to have been preferential or fraudulent under the federal Bankruptcy Code and the New York Debtor and Creditor Law. The remaining causes of action are for, among other things, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The complaint generally alleges that JPMorgan Chase, as Madoffs long-time bank, facilitated the maintenance of Madoffs Ponzi scheme and overlooked signs of wrongdoing in order to obtain profits and fees. The complaint purports to seek approximately
$19 billion
in damages from JPMorgan Chase, and to recover approximately
$425 million
in transfers that JPMorgan Chase allegedly received directly or indirectly from Bernard Madoffs brokerage firm. JPMorgan Chases motion to return the case from the Bankruptcy Court to the District Court was granted in May 2011 and JPMorgan Chase has moved to dismiss most of the Trustees claims.
Separately, J.P. Morgan Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, JPMorgan (Suisse) SA, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., and Bear Stearns Alternative Assets International Ltd. have been named as defendants in several suits in Bankruptcy Court and state and federal courts in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, Fairfield), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions advanced theories of mistake and restitution and sought to recover payments previously made to defendants by the funds totaling approximately
$140 million
. Fairfield and the Madoff Trustee reached an agreement pursuant to which the complaints against Cayman, Suisse, and JP Morgan Securities Ltd. will be dismissed and that agreement has been approved by the court.
In addition, a purported class action is pending against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as is a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. to an already-pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The JPMorgan Chase entities have moved to dismiss these actions.
Finally, JPMorgan Chase is a defendant in five actions pending in the New York state court and one individual action in federal court in New York. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. In the federal action, the Firm prevailed on its motion to dismiss before the District Court, and that decision was recently affirmed on appeal. In the state court actions, the Firms motion to dismiss has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting the courts decision. The Firm is also responding to various governmental inquiries concerning the Madoff matter.
Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation and Regulatory Investigations.
JPMorgan Chase and affiliates, Bear Stearns and affiliates and Washington Mutual affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles as issuer or underwriter in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offerings. These cases include purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities, actions by insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches and an action by a trustee. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for more than
$160 billion
of securities issued by dozens of securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including statements regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination.
In the actions against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter of its own MBS offerings), three purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and/or certain of their affiliates and current and former employees, in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Defendants moved to dismiss these actions. One of those motions has been granted in part to dismiss claims relating to all but one of the offerings. The other two motions remain pending. In addition, Washington Mutual affiliates, WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. and WaMu Capital Corp., along with certain former officers or directors of WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp., have been named as defendants in three now-consolidated purported class action cases pending in the Western District of Washington. Defendants motion to dismiss was granted in part to dismiss all claims relating to MBS offerings in which a named plaintiff was not a purchaser. Defendants have since moved for judgment on the pleadings as to all claims relating to all MBS Certificates of which a named plaintiff was not a purchaser. Plaintiffs have sought leave to amend their complaint to add JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a defendant on the theory that it is a successor to Washington Mutual Bank. The Firm has opposed this request. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification, which defendants have opposed. Discovery is ongoing.
In other actions brought against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter) certain JPMorgan Chase entities, several Bear Stearns entities, and certain Washington Mutual affiliates are defendants in ten separate individual actions commenced by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Indianapolis, Atlanta and Boston in various state courts around the country; and certain JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual entities are also among the defendants named in separate individual actions commenced by various institutional investors in federal and state courts.
175
EMC Mortgage Corporation (EMC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and certain other JPMorgan Chase entities are defendants in six pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payments of principal and interest on approximately
$3.6 billion
of certain classes of seven different MBS offerings sponsored by EMC. Two of those actions, commenced by Assured Guaranty Corp. and Syncora Guarantee, Inc., respectively, are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Syncora has also filed an action in New York state court alleging tort claims against arising out of the same transaction as its original federal complaint. The fourth action, filed by Ambac Assurance Corporation, was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds by the United States District for the Southern District of New York. The dismissal is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ambac has also filed a nearly identical complaint in New York state court. The sixth action, commenced by CIFG Assurance North America, Inc., is pending in state court in Texas, but Defendants have filed a motion arguing that New York is the superior forum. In most of the actions, the plaintiff claims that the underlying mortgage loans had origination defects that purportedly violate certain representations and warranties given by EMC to plaintiffs, and that EMC has breached the relevant agreements between the parties by failing to repurchase allegedly defective mortgage loans. In addition, the Ambac, CIFG and Syncora complaints allege fraudulent inducement and tortious interference, though tortious interference was dismissed from the Ambac federal action immediately before the jurisdictional dismissal. Each action seeks unspecified damages and, except in the Syncora state complaint, an order compelling EMC to repurchase those loans. The CIFG complaint also seeks punitive damages.
In the actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers, but those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now defunct, such as affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp (IndyMac Trusts) and Thornburg Mortgage (Thornburg). With respect to the IndyMac Trusts, JPMorgan Securities, along with numerous other underwriters and individuals, is named as a defendant, both in its own capacity and as successor to Bear Stearns in a purported class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of purchasers of securities in various IndyMac Trust MBS offerings. The court in that action has dismissed claims as to certain such securitizations, including all offerings in which no named plaintiff purchased securities, and allowed claims as to other offerings to proceed. Plaintiffs motion to certify a class of investors in certain offerings is pending, and discovery is ongoing. In addition, JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Chase are named as defendants in an individual action filed by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in connection with a single offering by an affiliate of IndyMac Bancorp. Discovery in that action is ongoing. Separately, JPMorgan Securities, as successor to Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., along with other underwriters and certain individuals, are defendants in an action pending in state court in California brought by MBIA Insurance Corp. (MBIA). The action relates to certain securities issued by IndyMac trusts in offerings in which Bear Stearns was an underwriter, and as to which MBIA provided guaranty insurance policies. MBIA purports to be subrogated to the rights of the MBS holders, and seeks recovery of sums it has paid and will pay pursuant to those policies. Discovery is ongoing. With respect to Thornburg, a Bear Stearns subsidiary is also a named defendant in a purported class action pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico along with a number of other financial institutions that served as depositors and/or underwriters for three Thornburg MBS offerings. Defendants have moved to dismiss this action.
A shareholder complaint has been filed in New York state court against the Firm and two affiliates, members of the boards of directors thereof and certain employees asserting claims based on alleged wrongful actions and inactions relating to residential mortgage originations and securitizations. The action seeks an accounting and damages.
In addition to the above-described litigation, the Firm has also received, and responded to, a number of subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning mortgage-related matters, including inquiries concerning a number of transactions involving the Firms origination and purchase of whole loans, underwriting and issuance of MBS, treatment of early payment defaults and potential breaches of securitization representations and warranties, due diligence in connection with securitizations and the Firms participation in offerings of certain collateralized debt obligations.
JPMorgan Securities has resolved the investigation by the SECs Division of Enforcement regarding certain collateralized debt obligations.
In addition to the above mortgage-related matters, the Firm is a defendant in an action commenced by Deutsche Bank, described in more detail below with respect to the Washington Mutual Litigations.
Mortgage Foreclosure Investigations and Litigation.
Multiple state and federal officials have announced investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates, relating to servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation processes. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations, and these investigations could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, as well as significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve have issued Consent Orders as to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase & Co., respectively. In their Orders, the regulators have mandated significant changes to the Firms servicing and default business and outlined requirements to implement these changes. Included in these requirements is the retention of an independent consultant to conduct an independent review of (and reimbursement of borrowers who sustained economic harm from) residential foreclosure actions or proceedings for loans serviced by the Firm that have been pending at any time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, as well as residential foreclosure sales that occurred during this time period. These
176
regulators have reserved the right to impose civil monetary penalties at a later date. Investigations by other state and federal authorities remain pending. Though the Firm has been in discussions with state and federal authorities about a potential global settlement of claims, there can be no assurance that any resolution will be reached.
Four purported class action lawsuits have also been filed against the Firm relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Additionally, the Firm is defending a purported class action brought against Bank of America involving an EMC loan. One of the cases has been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by the plaintiff. The Firm has moved to dismiss two of the remaining cases. In the fourth case, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Firm will move to dismiss.
A shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York state court against the Firms board of directors alleging that the board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. The action seeks a declaratory judgment and damages.
As of January 2011, the Firm had resumed initiation of new foreclosure proceedings in nearly all states in which it had previously suspended such proceedings, utilizing revised procedures in connection with the execution of affidavits and other documents used by Firm employees in the foreclosure process. The Firm is also in the process of reviewing pending foreclosure matters to determine whether remediation of specific documentation is necessary, and is resuming pending foreclosures as the review, and if necessary, remediation, of each pending matter is completed.
Municipal Derivatives Investigations and Litigation.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) (in conjunction with the Internal Revenue Service), the Securities and Exchange Commission, a group of state attorneys general, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York investigated the Firm for possible antitrust, securities and tax-related violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteed investment contracts and derivatives to municipal issuers. In July 2011, the Firm reached settlements with all of the government agencies to resolve these investigations. The settlements cover conduct in or prior to 2006. Under the terms of the settlements, the Firm entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and will pay a net amount of
$211 million
to the other government agencies. The Firm also agreed to implement measures to strengthen board oversight and compliance risk management programs relating to certain types of transactions.
Purported class action lawsuits and individual actions (the Municipal Derivatives Actions) have been filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the reportedly
$100 billion
to
$300 billion
annual market for financial instruments related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as municipal derivatives. The Municipal Derivatives Actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court denied in part and granted in part defendants motions to dismiss the purported class and individual actions, permitting certain claims to proceed against the Firm and others under federal and California state antitrust laws and under the California false claims act. Subsequently, a number of additional individual actions asserting substantially similar claims, including claims under New York and West Virginia state antitrust statutes, were filed against JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and numerous other defendants. All of these cases have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Discovery is ongoing.
Following J.P. Morgan Securities November 4, 2009, settlement with the SEC in connection with certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the County) warrant underwritings and swap transactions, various parties have brought civil litigation against the Firm. The County and a putative class of sewer rate payers have filed complaints against the Firm and several other defendants in Alabama state court. The suits allege that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than
$3 billion
in warrants issued by the County and chosen as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The complaints also allege that the Firm concealed these third-party payments and that, but for this concealment, the County would not have entered into the transactions. The Court denied the Firms motions to dismiss the complaints in both proceedings. The Firm filed a mandamus petition with the Alabama Supreme Court, seeking immediate appellate review of this decision. The mandamus petition in the Countys lawsuit was denied in April 2011. The mandamus petition in the lawsuit brought by sewer ratepayers remains pending
.
Separately, two insurance companies that guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on warrants issued by Jefferson County have filed separate actions against the Firm in New York state court. Their complaints assert that the Firm fraudulently misled them into issuing insurance based upon substantially the same alleged conduct described above and other alleged non-disclosures. One insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of nearly
$1.2 billion
and seeks unspecified damages in excess of
$400 million
, as well as unspecified punitive damages. The other insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of more than
$378 million
and seeks recovery of
$4 million
allegedly paid under the policies to date as well as any future payments and unspecified punitive damages. In December 2010, the court denied the Firms motions to dismiss each of the complaints. Discovery is proceeding.
Overdraft Fee/Debit Posting Order Litigation.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been named as a defendant in several purported class actions relating to its practices in posting debit card transactions to customers deposit accounts. Plaintiffs allege that the Firm improperly re-ordered debit card transactions from the highest amount to lowest amount before processing these transactions in order to generate unwarranted overdraft fees. Plaintiffs contend that the Firm should have processed such transactions in the
177
chronological order they were authorized. Plaintiffs seek the disgorgement of all overdraft fees paid to the Firm by plaintiffs since approximately 2003 as a result of the re-ordering of debit card transactions. The claims against the Firm have been consolidated with numerous complaints against other national banks in Multi-District Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Firms motion to compel arbitration of certain plaintiffs claims was denied by the District Court. That ruling is currently on appeal. Discovery is proceeding in the District Court.
Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters.
JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (OEP), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain entities affiliated with Petters (collectively, Petters) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by the court appointed receiver in the civil action filed by the federal government against Petters and the trustees in the bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities, and generally seek to avoid, on fraudulent transfer and preference grounds, certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition of Polaroid by Petters, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately
$450 million
. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees and have also sought to transfer those actions to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, where the receivers action is pending.
Securities Lending Litigation.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been named as a defendant in four putative class actions asserting ERISA and other claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by participants in the Firms securities lending business. A fifth lawsuit was filed in New York state court by an individual participant in the program. Three of the purported class actions, which have been consolidated, relate to investments of approximately
$500 million
in medium-term notes of Sigma Finance Inc. (Sigma). In August 2010, the Court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all securities lending participants that held Sigma medium-term notes on September 30, 2008, including those that held the notes by virtue of participation in the investment of cash collateral through a collective fund, as well as those that held the notes by virtue of the investment of cash collateral through individual accounts. All discovery has been completed. JPMorgan Chase has moved for partial summary judgment as to plaintiffs duty of loyalty claim, in which it is alleged that the Firm created an impermissible conflict of interest by providing repurchase financing to Sigma while also holding Sigma medium-term notes in securities lending accounts.
The fourth putative class action concerns investments of approximately
$500 million
in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Firm has moved to dismiss the amended complaint and is awaiting a decision. Discovery is proceeding while the motion is pending. The New York state court action, which is not a class action, concerns the plaintiffs alleged loss of money in both Sigma and Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Firm has answered the complaint. Discovery is proceeding.
Service Members Civil Relief Act and Housing and Economic Recovery Act Investigations and Litigation.
Multiple government officials have announced inquiries into the Firms procedures related to the Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). These inquiries have been prompted by the Firms public statements about its SCRA and HERA compliance and actions to remedy certain instances in which the Firm mistakenly charged active or recently-active military personnel mortgage interest and fees in excess of that permitted by SCRA and HERA, and in a number of instances, foreclosed on borrowers protected by SCRA and HERA. The Firm has implemented a number of procedural enhancements and controls to strengthen its SCRA and HERA compliance. In addition, an individual borrower filed a nationwide class action in United States District Court for South Carolina against the Firm alleging violations of the SCRA related to home loans. The Firm agreed to pay
$27 million
plus attorneys fees, in addition to reimbursements previously paid by the Firm, to settle the class action. The settlement has received preliminary approval by the court and is subject to final court approval.
Washington Mutual Litigations.
Subsequent to JPMorgan Chases acquisition from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank (Washington Mutual Bank) in September 2008, Washington Mutual Banks parent holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc. (WMI) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp. (together, the Debtors), both commenced voluntary cases under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Case). In the Bankruptcy Case, the Debtors have asserted rights and interests in certain assets. The assets in dispute include principally the following: (a) approximately
$4 billion
in trust securities contributed by WMI to Washington Mutual Bank (the Trust Securities); (b) the right to tax refunds arising from overpayments attributable to operations of Washington Mutual Bank and its subsidiaries; (c) ownership of and other rights in approximately
$4 billion
that WMI contends are deposit accounts at Washington Mutual Bank and one of its subsidiaries; and (d) ownership of and rights in various other contracts and other assets (collectively, the Disputed Assets).
WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC have since been involved in litigations over these and other claims pending in the Bankruptcy Court and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
178
In May 2010, WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC announced a global settlement agreement among themselves and significant creditor groups (the Global Settlement Agreement). The Global Settlement Agreement is incorporated into WMIs proposed Chapter 11 plan (the Plan) that has been submitted to the Bankruptcy Court. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Global Settlement would resolve numerous disputes among WMI, JPMorgan Chase, the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank and the FDIC in its corporate capacity, as well as those of significant creditor groups, including disputes relating to the Disputed Assets.
The Bankruptcy Court considered confirmation of the Plan, including the Global Settlement Agreement, in hearings in early December 2010. In early January 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that the Global Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable, but that the Plan cannot be confirmed until the parties correct certain deficiencies, which include the scope of releases. None of these deficiencies relates to the Disputed Assets. The Equity Committee, which represents shareholders of WMI, has filed a petition seeking a direct appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from so much of the Bankruptcy Courts ruling that found the settlement to be fair and reasonable. A revised Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court in February 2011. The Bankruptcy Court concluded the evidentiary portion of the confirmation hearings for the revised Plan in July 2011. Oral argument is scheduled for August 24, 2011. If the Court ultimately confirms the Plan and the Global Settlement becomes effective, then the Firm currently estimates it will not incur net additional liabilities beyond those already reflected in its balance sheet for the numerous disputes covered by the Global Settlement.
Other proceedings related to Washington Mutuals failure are also pending before the Bankruptcy Court. Among other actions, in July 2010, certain holders of the Trust Securities commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase, WMI, and other entities seeking, among other relief, a declaratory judgment that WMI and JPMorgan Chase do not have any right, title or interest in the Trust Securities. In early January 2011, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment to JPMorgan Chase and denied summary judgment to the plaintiffs in the Trust Securities adversary proceeding.
Other proceedings related to Washington Mutuals failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated
$6 billion
to
$10 billion
in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain WMI subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities relating to the mortgage securitization agreements. In April 2011, the District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Banks claims. Discovery is underway.
In addition, JPMorgan Chase was sued in an action originally filed in State Court in Texas (the Texas Action) by certain holders of WMI common stock and debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who seek unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at an allegedly too-low price. The Texas Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ultimately granted JPMorgan Chases and the FDICs motions to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed this dismissal and on June 24, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the trial courts dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.
* * *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm incurred litigation expense of
$1.9 billion
and
$792 million
, respectively, during the
three
months ended
June 30, 2011
, and
2010
, and
$3.0 billion
and
$3.7 billion
, respectively, during the
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
. There is no assurance that the Firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firms consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chases income for that period.
179
NOTE 24  BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are six major reportable business segments - Investment Bank, Retail Financial Services,
Card Services & Auto
, Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management, as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see the footnotes to the table below. For a further discussion concerning
JPMorgan Chase
s business segments, see Business Segment Results on pages 1718 of
this Form 10-Q
, and pages 6768 and Note 34 on pages 290293 of
JPMorgan Chase
s
2010
Annual Report
.
Subsequent business segment changes
Commencing July 1, 2011, the Firms business segments have been reorganized as follows:
Auto and Student Lending transferred from the RFS segment and are reported with
Card
in a single segment. RFS continues as a segment, organized in two components: Consumer & Business Banking (formerly Retail Banking) and Mortgage Banking (including Mortgage Production and Servicing, and Real Estate Portfolios).
The business segment information associated with RFS and Card that is included in the following Segment results section has been revised to reflect the business reorganization retroactive to January 1, 2010.
Segment results
The following tables provide a summary of the Firms segment results for the three and
six
months ended
June 30, 2011
and
2010
, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This approach allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).
Effective January 1, 2011, capital allocated to
Card
was reduced, largely reflecting portfolio runoff and the improving risk profile of the business; capital allocated to TSS was increased, reflecting growth in the underlying business. The Firm continues to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the Firm) as of
June 30, 2011
, and the related consolidated statements of income for the three-month and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2011
and
June 30, 2010
, and the consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income for the six-month periods ended
June 30, 2011
and
June 30, 2010
, included in the Firms Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
June 30, 2011
. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firms management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements, for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2010
, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 28, 2011, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2010
, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Contractual credit card charge-off
: In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specific event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier.
Corporate/Private Equity:
Includes Private Equity, Treasury and Chief Investment Office, and Corporate Other, which includes other centrally managed expense and discontinued operations.
Credit derivatives:
Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency or failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event.
CUSIP number:
A CUSIP (i.e. Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number identifies most securities, including: stocks of all registered U.S. and Canadian companies, and U.S. government and municipal bonds. The CUSIP system  owned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poors  facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities.

186
LLC:
Limited Liability Company.
Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio:
For
residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the MSA level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all lien positions related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.
Managed basis:
A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.
Mark-to-market exposure
: A measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the MTM value is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates credit risk for the Firm. When the MTM value is negative, JPMorgan Chase owes the counterparty; in this situation, the Firm has liquidity risk.
Master netting agreement:
An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.
Mortgage product types:
Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined-loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. Perhaps the most important characteristic is limited documentation. A substantial proportion of traditional Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans generally have low default risk and are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are designed for customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrowers primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.
 
187
MSR risk management revenue:
Includes changes in the fair value of the MSR asset due to market-based inputs, such as interest rates and volatility, as well as updates to assumptions used in the MSR valuation model; and derivative valuation adjustments and other, which represents changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to offset the impact of changes in the market-based inputs to the MSR valuation model.
Multi-asset:
Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class (e.g., long-term fixed income, equity, cash, real assets, private equity or hedge funds).
NA:
Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.
Net charge-off rate:
Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.
Net yield on interest-earning assets:
The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.
NM:
Not meaningful.
OPEB:
Other postretirement employee benefits.
Overhead ratio:
Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.
Participating securities:
Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, dividends), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.
Personal bankers:
Retail branch office personnel who acquire, retain and expand new and existing customer relationships by assessing customer needs and recommending and selling appropriate banking products and services.
Portfolio activity:
Describes changes to the risk profile of existing lending-related exposures and their impact on the allowance for credit losses from changes in customer profiles and inputs used to estimate the allowances.
Pre-provision profit:
Pre-provision profit is total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
Pretax margin:
Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in managements view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors.
Principal transactions:
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodities inventories that are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value) and changes in fair value associated with financial instruments held predominantly by IB for which the fair value option was elected. Principal transactions revenue also includes private equity gains and losses.
Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans:
Acquired loans deemed to be credit-impaired under the FASB guidance for PCI loans. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., FICO score, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Wholesale loans are determined to be credit-impaired if they meet the definition of an impaired loan under U.S. GAAP at the acquisition date. Consumer loans are determined to be credit-impaired based on specific risk characteristics of the loan, including product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, and past due status.
Receivables from customers:
Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the wholesale lines of business.
Reported basis:
Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.
Retained loans:
Loans that are held-for-investment excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.
Risk-weighted assets (RWA)
: Risk-weighted assets consist of on-and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-
188
balance sheet assets. RWA also incorporate a measure for the market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total RWA.
Sales specialists:
Retail branch office personnel who specialize in the marketing of a single product, including mortgages, investments and business banking, by partnering with the personal bankers.
Stress testing:
A scenario that measures market risk under unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets.
Taxable-equivalent basis:
Total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to fully taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
Troubled debt restructuring (TDR):
Occurs when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.
Unaudited:
Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.
U.S. GAAP:
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:
Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
U.S. Treasury:
U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Value-at-risk (VaR):
A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.
Washington Mutual transaction:
On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (Washington Mutual) from the FDIC. For additional information, see Note 2 on pages 166170 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report.
