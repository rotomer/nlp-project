Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firms results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. 2. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit-impaired portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion at March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2011, respectively. 3. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firms capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as Basel III. The Firms estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firms current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firms estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firms businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firms capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firms capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. The Firms understanding of the Basel III rules is based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies. 4. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firms earnings as a percentage of TCE. In managements view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firms use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with competitors 5. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information is provided for Card Services, to provide more meaningful measures that ensure comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 6. In addition to reviewing JPMorgan Chase's net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews core net interest income to assess the performance of its core lending, investing (including asset /liability management), and deposit-raising activities, excluding the impact of IB's market-based activities. The chart presents an analysis of managed core net interest income and core net interest margin. These are non-GAAP financial measures due to the exclusion of IB's market-based net interest income and the related assets. Management believes the exclusion of IB's market-based activities provides investors and analysts a more meaningful measure to analyze non-market related business trends of the Firm and can be used as a comparable measure to other financial institutions primarily focused on core lending, investing and deposit-raising activities. Additional notes on financial measures 7. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in managements view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. 8. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in managements view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. 9. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.
