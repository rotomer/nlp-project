Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firms results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. 2. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firms capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as Basel III. The Firms estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firms current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firms estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firms businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firms capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firms capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. The Firms understanding of the Basel III rules is based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies. Financial restatement 3. On July 13, 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported that it will be restating its previously-filed interim financial statements for the first quarter 2012. The restatement will have the effect of reducing the Firms reported net income for 2012 first quarter by $459 million (after-tax). The first quarter 2012 amounts in this presentation reflect the effects of such restatement. For further information, see the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 13, 2012, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on the Companys website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase) and on the Securities and Exchange Commissions website (www.sec.gov).

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firms results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. 2. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion at June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012, and June 30, 2011, respectively. 3. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firms earnings as a percentage of TCE. In managements view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firms use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with peers. 4. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firms capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as Basel III. The Firms estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firms current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firms estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firms businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firms capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firms capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. The Firms understanding of the Basel III rules is based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies. 5. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information is provided for Card Services, to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The change in net income is presented excluding the change in the allowance. The net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. Additional notes on financial measures 6. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. 7. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in managements view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. 8. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in managements view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective peers. 9. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of 1Q12. 10. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services & Auto and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Investment Bank. Financial restatement 11. On July 13, 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported that it will be restating its previously-filed interim financial statements for the first quarter 2012. The restatement will have the effect of reducing the Firms reported net income for 2012 first quarter by $459 million. The first quarter 2012 amounts in this supplement reflect the effects of such restatement. For further information, see the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 13, 2012, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on the Companys website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase) and on the Securities and Exchange Commissions website (www.sec.gov).

Task force scope  Management review and assessment of circumstances surrounding CIO losses  Assisted by outside counsel  Comprehensive fact-gathering effort  Conducted numerous interviews with JPMC personnel, including Firm Management, CIO Management, other CIO personnel, Risk and other corporate functions  Reviewed emails and other documentary materials  Analyzed trade history, valuation of portfolio positions and risk measures (e.g., VaR, stress)  Regular progress reviews with Board Review Committee and its advisors in conjunction with their and our ongoing work 1 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
Summary observations  CIO judgment, execution and escalation in 1Q12 were poor  Level of scrutiny did not evolve commensurate with increasing complexity of CIO activities  CIO Risk Management was ineffective in dealing with Synthetic Credit Portfolio  Risk limits for CIO were not sufficiently granular  Approval and implementation of CIO Synthetic Credit VaR model were inadequate 4 3 2 1 5 2 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
 Principal objective of Synthetic Credit Portfolio was to provide benefit in a stressed credit environment  Intended to provide a partial hedge to credit exposures  Included long positions to reduce costs of credit protection  Adjusted over time to reflect changes in macro views  Synthetic Credit Portfolio performed as expected between 2007-2011  Portfolio generated approximately $2B in P&L during 2007-2011  P&L was positive in each year Historical context Facts 3 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
 In late 2011, Firm Management instructed CIO to reduce Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) as part of annual budgeting process  1Q12: CIO intended to reduce short credit position and lower RWA, while maintaining benefit from individual corporate defaults and optimizing P&L  Increased net long position on Investment Grade (IG) indices  Increased short positions in some junior tranches for further default protection  Continued to increase size in attempt to balance portfolio and deal with market and P&L pressures, including perceived vulnerability to other market participants  By end of March, result was dramatically increased size, complexity and exposure to various risks, including:  Exposure to relationship of Investment Grade to High Yield indices  Default correlation across capital structure (e.g., Super Senior vs. Mezzanine)  Basis between off-the-run indices and on-the-run indices  Despite change in size, complexity and risk, insufficient escalation to Firm Management Transformation of the portfolio Facts 4 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E

 Certain CIO-level risk limits exceeded during 1Q12  Related to credit spread widening  Addressed within CIO  New Synthetic Credit VaR model approved by independent Model Review Group in late January  In response to VaR limit excessions, Firm Management approved temporary increase of firmwide VaR limit in anticipation of lower VaR from new CIO Synthetic Credit model  February CIO Business Review with Firm Management  Limited discussion of Synthetic Credit Portfolio  CIO indicated that portfolio was well-positioned and RWA reduction was on track Key events through the build-up of positions Facts Vast majority of positions accumulated by March 23 CIO Management directed curtailment of trading on March 23 6 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
 Losses increased in late March  Heightened external market visibility of CIO positions including news reports in early April  Firm Management requested review of Synthetic Credit Portfolio  Head of CIO conducted review with regular updates to CFO and CRO  CIO estimated 2Q12 probable P&L range of -$250mm to +$350mm (with bias to the positive end) and potential for greater gains or losses in extreme scenarios  CIO Management expressed firm belief that market visibility had significantly affected pricing and that P&L would revert  CEO and CFO given multiple assurances that position was manageable  April 13: Earnings release and Synthetic Credit Portfolio related commentary Key events between position build-up and 1Q12 earnings release Facts 7 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
 Late April: Increase in losses prompts detailed review by Corporate Risk Management  Senior Corporate Risk Management team began on site, bottom-up engagement on April 27 and provides daily updates to Firm Management  Corporate Risk Management assumes control of Synthetic Credit Portfolio on April 30  Early May:  VaR model analyzed and implementation errors detected; previous model reinstated  10Q filed on May 10 with disclosure pertaining to CIO trading losses; Synthetic Credit Portfolio update provided on May 10 conference call  New CIO leadership appointed and Management Review of CIO launched Key events leading up to new CIO leadership and Management Review Facts 8 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
Facts leading to observations Observations  CIO judgment, execution and escalation in 1Q12 were poor  Level of scrutiny did not evolve commensurate with increasing complexity of CIO activities  CIO Risk Management was ineffective in dealing with Synthetic Credit Portfolio  Risk limits for CIO were not sufficiently granular  Approval and implementation of Synthetic Credit VaR model were inadequate 4 3 2 1 Facts  CIO intended to reduce short credit position and RWA in 1Q12  Executed strategy resulted in increased position size, complexity and risk  CIO-level risk limits exceeded in 1Q12 and trading curtailed in late March  CIO review in early April resulted in multiple assurances to Firm Management that position was manageable  As losses increased in late April, Corporate Risk Management assumed control  New CIO leadership appointed and Management Review launched in mid-May 5 9 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
CIO judgment, execution and escalation in 1Q12 were poor Observations  Trading approach was poorly designed, vetted and executed  Poor trading judgment in 1Q12  CIO Management did not set clear objectives, properly vet the trading strategy or sufficiently examine underlying positions and correlations  Traders and managers of Synthetic Credit Portfolio did not adequately highlight issues or seek support from broader CIO or Firm Management  CIO-led review and analysis of Synthetic Credit Portfolio in advance of earnings release was too optimistic in hindsight  Gave assurances that magnitude of potential losses was manageable; and that the portfolio was balanced and would recover 1 10 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
Level of scrutiny did not evolve commensurate with increasing complexity of CIO activities Observations  CIOs mandate and historical performance may have contributed to less rigorous scrutiny of CIO  Perception that CIO risks were primarily related to managing Firms investment portfolio  Track record of CIO unit  Synthetic Credit Portfolio produced positive results from 2007 to 2011  This resulted in a level of scrutiny inconsistent with that for client- facing businesses 2 11 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
CIO Risk Management was ineffective in dealing with Synthetic Credit Portfolio Observations  CIO Risk Management group faced challenges  Transitions in key roles and lack of adequate resources  Lack of robust Risk Committee structure  Nonetheless, CIO Risk Management failed to meet expectations  Inadequacy of risk limits should have been addressed in a timely manner  Insufficient engagement in VaR model implementation  Not forceful in challenging front office  Insufficient escalation to Firm Management 3 12 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
Risk limits in CIO were not sufficiently granular Observations  No specific risk limits for Synthetic Credit Portfolio  Portfolio was subsumed within more aggregated CIO limits  No limits by size, asset type or risk factor for Synthetic Credit Portfolio  Credit derivatives desk in IB operated under more granular risk limits 4 13 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
Approval and implementation of Synthetic Credit VaR model were inadequate Facts and observations  Between August and November 2011, CIO developed a new Synthetic Credit VaR model to prepare for implementation of Basel 2.5  Independent Model Review Group (MRG) review between November 2011 and January 2012 focused primarily on methodology and CIO-submitted test results  Model review policy and process presumed robust operational and risk infrastructure that exists in client-facing businesses  Relied on CIO to conduct parallel testing and ensure operational stability  CIO Risk Management played passive role in model development, approval, implementation and monitoring  Relied on testing by front office prior to implementation  Insufficient challenge of VaR results generated by the front office prior to approval  Insufficient ownership, oversight, and post-implementation monitoring of VaR operational environment  Implementation of model by CIO front office suffered from operational challenges  Although a correctly implemented model was expected to result in lower VaR, errors in model implementation contributed to a further lowering of VaR 5 14 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E

Q & A  CIO valuation matters  Compensation 20 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E
 
CIO valuation matters  CIO valuation processes related to quarter-end  CIO traders marked their positions at end of Q1  CIOs Valuation Control Group (VCG), which is part of Finance, verified that trader marks were within pre-established thresholds that considered market bid/offer spreads; marks outside those thresholds were adjusted  Management review has recently identified concerns around the integrity of traders marks  Emails, voice tapes and other documents, supplemented by interviews, suggestive of trader intent not to mark positions where they believed they could execute  Traders may have been seeking to avoid showing full amount of losses  As a result, the Firm decided to utilize external mid-market benchmarks, adjusted for liquidity considerations 21 C I O T A S K F O R C E U P D A T E  Management has concluded that a material weakness in the CIO valuation controls over the Synthetic Credit Portfolio existed in Q1 2012  We believe the material weakness has been substantially remediated in Q2 2012 and does not exist elsewhere in the Firm Q1 2012 Earnings restatement1 Q1 2012 Material weakness1 1 For further detail, please refer to the Form 8-K
