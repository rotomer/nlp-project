When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series O Preferred Stock, all dividends declared and paid upon shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series O Preferred Stock shall be declared and paid pro rata.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation, or any increase or decrease in the number of shares
 
of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of stock of the Corporation, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares of Series O Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to adversely affect such powers, preferences or special rights.
(c) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 5 or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by the Corporation, each share of Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote (the holders of shares of any other class or series of Voting Parity Stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such stock held as may be granted to them).
(d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required or upon which the holders of Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust to effect such redemption.
6. .
Redemption
(a) The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, the Series O Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date on or after September 1, 2017, in whole, or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series O Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. Dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares on the redemption date, without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
(b) At any time within 90 days after a Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), the Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may provide notice of its intent to redeem in accordance with the procedures described below, and the Corporation may subsequently redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, the Series O Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series O Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. Dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares on the redemption date, without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
"" shall mean the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of any:
Capital Treatment Event
(i) amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock;
(ii) proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock; or
 
(iii) official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock,
there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation shall not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full liquidation amount of all shares of Series O Preferred Stock then outstanding as "Tier 1 capital" (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Series O Preferred Stock is outstanding.
(c) Notice of every redemption of shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(c) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series O Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series O Preferred Stock. Each notice of redemption shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series O Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series O Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by The Depository Trust Company.
(d) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series O Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series O Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of Series O Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series O Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.
(e) If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the "Depositary Company") in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that
 
any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall be cancelled and shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all other rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except for the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
(f) Shares of Series O Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of preferred stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of preferred stock.
7. . The Board of Directors reserves the right from time to time to increase or decrease the number of shares that constitute the Series O Preferred Stock (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) and in other respects to amend this Certificate of Designation within the limitations provided by law, this resolution and the Certificate of Incorporation.
Amendment of Resolution
8. . Any capital stock of any class or classes or series of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank:
Rank
(a) senior to shares of the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, if the holders of capital stock of such class or classes or series shall be entitled by the terms thereof to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of the Series O Preferred Stock (and as used herein, the term and like terms refer to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that ranks senior to the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the context may require);

respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without preference or priority of one over the other as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of Series O Preferred Stock (and as used herein, the term and like terms refer to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that ranks on a parity with the shares of Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the context may require); and

Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.
Form and Transferability of Receipts
 
Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary; provided, that if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed then such Receipts shall also be countersigned by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Registrar. No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption or voting rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
provided
however
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by one or more receipts (the ""),
DTC Receipts
 
which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipts as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipts shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipts, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
If issued, the DTC Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipts shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipts, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipts definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipts shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal or redemption of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.
SECTION 2.02 . Concurrently with the execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Company is delivering to the Depositary a certificate or certificates, registered in the name of the Depositary and evidencing 125,750 shares of Preferred Stock, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together with (i) all such certifications as may be required by the Depositary in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and (ii) a written order of the Company directing the Depositary to execute and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated in such order a Receipt or Receipts for the Depositary Shares representing such deposited Preferred Stock registered in such names specified in such written order. The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 125,750 shares of Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints Computershare Shareowner Services LLC as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and Computershare Shareowner Services LLC hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
Deposit of Preferred Stock; Execution and Delivery of Receipts in Respect Thereof
 
Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof (which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
SECTION 2.03 . Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 40 nor more than 70 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the ""), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class, notice of the redemption of Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
Optional Redemption of Preferred Stock for Cash
redemption price
The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price (including any declared and unpaid dividends); (iii) the number of shares of deposited Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
 
In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price (including any declared and unpaid dividends)) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depositary at a redemption price per Depositary Share equal to 1/400th of the redemption price per share paid in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock, plus declared and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
If less than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption; provided, however, that such replacement Receipt shall be issued only in denominations of whole Depositary Shares and cash will be payable in respect of fractional interests.
If less than all of the Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
SECTION 2.04 . The Company hereby appoints Computershare Shareowner Services LLC as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and Computershare Shareowner Services LLC hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law. Upon such surrender, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts and deliver the same to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered.
Registration of Transfers of Receipts
SECTION 2.05 . Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of Receipts, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute and deliver a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denominations requested evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered.
Combinations and Split-ups of Receipts
 
SECTION 2.06 Any holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw any number of whole shares of deposited Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt or Receipts and all money and other property, if any, represented by such Depositary Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; provided, that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption. If such holder's Depositary Shares are being held by DTC or its nominee, DTC shall be deemed the holder hereunder for all purposes. It shall be the duty of the DTC participant or the beneficial owner to request DTC to withdraw from the book-entry system the number of Depositary Shares specified above. Upon such surrender, upon payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of Receipts to the extent provided in Section 5.06 and payment of all taxes and governmental charges in connection with such surrender and withdrawal of Preferred Stock, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of such Preferred Stock and all such money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive Depositary Shares therefor. If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares. Delivery of such Preferred Stock and such money and other property being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.
Surrender of Receipts and Withdrawal of Preferred Stock.
If the deposited Preferred Stock and the money and other property being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Preferred Stock, such holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement in blank.
The Depositary shall deliver the deposited Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such holder.
 
SECTION 2.07 . As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Company may require any or all of the following: (i) payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Company shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any tax or other governmental charge and stock transfer or registration fee with respect thereto (including any such tax or charge with respect to the Preferred Stock being deposited or withdrawn); (ii) the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature (or the authority of any signature); and (iii) compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Company may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by any securities exchange on which the deposited Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts may be included for quotation or listed or any applicable self-regulatory body.
Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Split-up, Combination, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts
The deposit of Preferred Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Preferred Stock may be suspended, the transfer of Receipts may be refused, and the transfer, split-up, combination, surrender, exchange or redemption of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Company is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed reasonably necessary or advisable by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Company at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission, or under any other provision of this Deposit Agreement.
SECTION 2.08 In case any Receipt shall be mutilated and surrendered to the Depositary or destroyed or lost or stolen, the Depositary shall execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt; provided, that the holder thereof shall have (a) filed with the Depositary (i) a request for such execution and delivery before the Depositary has notice that the Receipt has been acquired by a protected purchaser and (ii) an indemnity bond and (b) satisfied any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Depositary.
Lost Receipts, etc.
SECTION 2.09 . All Receipts surrendered to the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary. Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depositary is authorized, but not required, to destroy such Receipts so cancelled.

Any person presenting Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary.

Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.06, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid.

Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
Payment of Fees and Expenses
SECTION 3.03 . In the case of the initial deposit of the Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.04 . The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/400 fractional interest in a share of deposited Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share.

Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares
SECTION 4.01 . Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Preferred Stock, including any cash
Cash Distributions
 
received upon redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.01 and 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
provided
however
SECTION 4.02 . Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.01 and 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such record holders, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Company or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Company, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the property thus received, or any part thereof, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be, subject to Sections 3.01 and 3.02, distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to record holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
Distributions Other Than Cash

Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges
 
Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.01 and 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement, that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
SECTION 4.04 . Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts
 
distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof; to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
SECTION 4.05 . Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/400th of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Preferred Stock or cause such Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will not vote Depositary Shares held by it. In the absence of authorization from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will abstain from voting (but, at its discretion, not from appearing at any meeting with respect to the Preferred Stock unless directed to the contrary by the record holders of all the related Receipts) to the extent of the shares of Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) represented by the applicable Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
Voting Rights
SECTION 4.06 . Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price of a share of Preferred Stock, as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the
Changes Affecting Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events
 
effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger, amalgamation or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property and cash into which the Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Preferred Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
SECTION 4.07 . The Depositary shall make available for inspection by record holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 7.04.
Inspection of Reports
SECTION 4.08 . Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
Lists of Receipt Holders
SECTION 5.01 .

(d) So long as any shares of the Series O Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other stock ranking junior to the Series O Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the common stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to the Series O Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, nor shall any common stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series O Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series O Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), unless, in each case, full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series O Preferred Stock shall have been declared and paid or set aside for payment in respect of the most recently completed Dividend Period.
3.
Liquidation Preference.
(a) Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the common stock or on any other class of stock ranking junior to the Series O Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $10,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends on each such share without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
(b) After the payment to the holders of the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 3, the holders of the Series O Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
 
(c) If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the amounts payable with respect to the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and any other shares of stock of the Corporation ranking as to any such distribution on a parity with the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and of such other shares shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are entitled.
(d) Neither the sale of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other entity or the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 3.
4. . The holders of Series O Preferred Stock shall not have any preemptive or conversion rights with respect to the Series O Preferred Stock.

5.
Voting Rights.
(a) The Series O Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights, except as provided below or as otherwise specifically required by law. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on the shares of Series O Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six or more quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of the Series O Preferred Stock shall have the right, with holders of shares of any one or more other classes or series of Parity Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 8) outstanding at the time upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (""), voting together as a class, to elect two directors (hereinafter the and each a ) to fill such newly created directorships at the Corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends have been paid on the Series O Preferred Stock for at least four quarterly consecutive Dividend Periods at which time such right shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of shares of Series O Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate immediately and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the number of Preferred Directors elected pursuant hereto. Any Preferred Director may be removed or replaced at any time, with or without cause, and any vacancy created thereby may be filled only by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Series O Preferred Stock voting separately as a class together with the holders of shares of Voting Parity Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal from office as aforesaid, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

"Preferred Director"
(b) So long as any shares of any Series O Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the Series O Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock, voting together as a class, (i) authorize, create or issue any capital stock of the Corporation ranking, as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, senior to such Series O Preferred Stock, or reclassify any authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock, or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the certificate of designation for the Series O Preferred Stock, or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series O Preferred Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation, or any increase or decrease in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of stock of the Corporation, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares of Series O Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to adversely affect such powers, preferences or special rights.
 
(c) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 5 or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by the Corporation, each share of Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote (the holders of shares of any other class or series of Voting Parity Stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such stock held as may be granted to them).
(d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required or upon which the holders of Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust to effect such redemption.
6.
Redemption.
(a) The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, the Series O Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date on or after September 1, 2017, in whole, or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series O Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. Dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares on the redemption date, without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
(b) At any time within 90 days after a Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), the Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may provide notice of its intent to redeem in accordance with the procedures described below, and the Corporation may subsequently redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, the Series O Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series O Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date. Dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares on the redemption date, without accumulation of undeclared dividends.
"" shall mean the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of any:
Capital Treatment Event
(i) amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock;
(ii) proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock; or
(iii) official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of Series O Preferred Stock,
 
there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation shall not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full liquidation amount of all shares of Series O Preferred Stock then outstanding as "Tier 1 capital" (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Series O Preferred Stock is outstanding.
(c) Notice of every redemption of shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(c) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series O Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series O Preferred Stock. Each notice of redemption shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series O Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series O Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by The Depository Trust Company.
(d) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series O Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series O Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of Series O Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series O Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.
(e) If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the "Depositary Company") in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall be cancelled and shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares
 
shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all other rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except for the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
(f) Shares of Series O Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of preferred stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of preferred stock.
7. . The Board of Directors reserves the right from time to time to increase or decrease the number of shares that constitute the Series O Preferred Stock (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) and in other respects to amend this Certificate of Designation within the limitations provided by law, this resolution and the Certificate of Incorporation.
Amendment of Resolution
8. . Any capital stock of any class or classes or series of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank:
Rank
(a) senior to shares of the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, if the holders of capital stock of such class or classes or series shall be entitled by the terms thereof to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of the Series O Preferred Stock (and as used herein, the term and like terms refer to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that ranks senior to the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the context may require);
"senior to the Series O Preferred Stock"
(b) on a parity with shares of the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series O Preferred Stock, if the holders of capital stock of such class or classes or series shall be entitled by the terms thereof to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributed upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in proportion to or otherwise based on their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without preference or priority of one over the other as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of Series O Preferred Stock (and as used herein, the term and like terms refer to any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that ranks on a parity with the shares of Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the context may require); and
"Parity Preferred Stock"
 
(c) junior to shares of the Series O Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, if such class or classes or series shall be common stock or if the holders of the Series O Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of capital stock of such class or classes or series (and as used herein, the term and like terms refer to common stock of the Corporation and any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation over which the Series O Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the context may require).
"junior to the Series O Preferred Stock"
The Series O Preferred Stock shall rank as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up on a parity with the Corporation's Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I and 8.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J.

We have acted as counsel to JPMorgan Chase & Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-169900) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the offering by the Company of an aggregate of 50,300,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each Depositary Share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of the Company's 5.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series O, $1 par value per share and liquidation preference $10,000 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), and in aggregate representing 125,750 shares (the "Shares") of the Preferred Stock, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated August 20, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and J.P.
