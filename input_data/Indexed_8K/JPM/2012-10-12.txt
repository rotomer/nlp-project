Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firms results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. 2. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion at September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011, respectively. 3. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firms earnings as a percentage of TCE. In managements view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firms use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with peers. 4. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firms capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as Basel III. In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules on Basel 2.5 that will go into effect on January 1, 2013 and result in additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the NPR) for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The Firms estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firms current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firms estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firms businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firms capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firms capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. 5. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information is provided for Card Services, to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The change in net income is presented excluding the change in the allowance, which assumes a tax rate of 38%. The net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 6. In the Investment Bank, the following metrics are provided excluding the impact of debit valuation adjustments (DVA): net revenue, net income, compensation ratio and return on equity. These measures are used by management, investors and analysts to assess the underlying performance of the business. Additional notes on financial measures 7. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. 8. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in managements view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. 9. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in managements view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective peers. 10. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of 2Q12. 11. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services & Auto and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Investment Bank.
