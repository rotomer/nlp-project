NORDSTROM For Immediate Release INVESTOR CONTACT: February 20, 2002 Stephanie Allen Nordstrom, Inc. (206)303-3262 MEDIA CONTACT: Shasha Richardson Nordstrom, Inc. (206)373-3038 NORDSTROM REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE - --------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - February 20, 2002 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $60.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2002, which ended January 31, 2003. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $50.7 million and $0.38, respectively. The 18 percent improvement in fourth quarter earnings was primarily driven by increased sales and lower selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 7.3 percent, to $1.8 billion, compared to sales of $1.6 billion in the same period last year. On a calendar basis, fourth quarter 2002 same-store sales increased 1.9 percent. For fiscal 2002, which consists of the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2003, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $90.2 million and $0.66, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per diluted share of $124.7 million and $0.93 for the same period last year, a 28 percent decline. Excluding $71.0 million (net of tax) in non-recurring and impairment charges related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change, the purchase of a minority interest in Nordstrom.com and associated reintegration costs, and the write-down of an information technology investment(3), fiscal 2002 net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $161.3 million and $1.19, respectively. Higher-than-planned increases in same-store sales coupled with planned improvements in gross profit and selling, general and administrative expense, drove the 29 percent increase in earnings, excluding non-recurring and impairment charges. Fiscal 2002 net sales of $6.0 billion increased 6.1 percent, compared to sales of $5.6 billion in the same period in 2001. On a calendar basis, fiscal 2002 same-store sales increased 1.4 percent. The company said it made progress executing its 2002 key initiatives, which included driving sales increases, continuing to improve operational disciplines related to gross margin and selling, general and administrative expense, and completing the implementation of perpetual inventory. Progress towards these objectives included same-store sales increases for eight of the last nine months and modest improvements in both gross margin and expense levels, on a percentage of sales basis. In addition, all major elements of the perpetual inventory implementation were completed according to plan and under budget. "We are proud of our people and the job that they did this past year," said President Blake Nordstrom. "We are also encouraged by the opportunities we see to continue to improve both performance and service to our customers." During fiscal 2002 Nordstrom opened eight full-line stores, four Nordstrom Rack stores and one U.S. Faconnable boutique. Gross square footage for the year increased approximately 8.0 percent, from 17,048,000 to 18,428,000.
2003 Performance Outlook: The Company is providing the following 2003 forecasts: Nordstrom, Inc. is one of the nation's leading fashion specialty retailers, with 142 US stores located in 27 states. Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle, Nordstrom today operates 88 full-line stores, 47 Nordstrom Racks, five U.S. Faconnable boutiques, one freestanding shoe store, and one clearance store. Nordstrom also operates 23 international Faconnable boutiques, primarily in Europe.
