As CAO, Stinson has been responsible for Nordstrom real estate, store planning, business information and technology, supply chain and operations. Most recently, he was responsible for supporting the rollout of the company's perpetual inventory system.

"Joel has consistently performed to the highest levels and exceeded expectations in every assignment he has undertaken," said Blake Nordstrom, president, Nordstrom, Inc. "He has been instrumental in helping the company move forward with technology and embrace perpetual inventory. As a key member of the executive team, much of the progress the company has made in the last two and a half years is attributable to his leadership." Replacing Joel Stinson as CAO will be Dan Little. Little joined Nordstrom in July 2002 as vice president of supply chain strategy. He has more than 19 years experience in operations and supply chain management. Prior to joining Nordstrom, Little spent nine years at Colgate-Palmolive, most recently as the manufacturing general manager for personal care products in Europe.

Little received his master's in business administration from Harvard in 1991. He also holds a bachelor's of science, cum laude, in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington in 1984. Dan is a Northwest native and grew up in Longview, Washington. "Joel and Dan have been working closely together for the past year and we welcome him to the team," said Nordstrom.
