Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 7, 2003 NORDSTROM REPORTS JULY SAME-STORE SALES INCREASE OF 6.1% -------------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - August 7, 2003 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $690.2 million for the four-week period ending August 2, 2003, an increase of 9.0 percent compared to sales of $633.4 million for the four-week period ending August 3, 2002. Same-store sales increased 6.1 percent. July same-store sales in full-line stores increased in all geographic regions and in all major merchandise divisions. Preliminary second quarter sales of $1.8 billion increased 7.9 percent compared to 2002 second quarter sales of $1.7 billion. Second quarter same- store sales increased 3.9 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $3.1 billion increased 6.0 percent compared to year-to-date 2002 sales of $2.9 billion. Year-to-date same-store sales increased 1.6 percent. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's newly issued Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. This change in the fiscal calendar has resulted in differences in the number of days included in the current period versus the same period in the prior year. Sales performance numbers included in this sales release have been calculated on a comparative 4-5-4 basis. The Company believes that adjusting for these differences provides a more comparable basis (4-5-4 vs. 4-5-4) from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges 2002 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
