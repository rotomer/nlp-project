Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- November 6, 2003 NORDSTROM REPORTS OCTOBER SAME-STORE SALES INCREASE OF 3.5% ----------------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - November 6, 2003 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $454.4 million for the four-week period ending November 1, 2003, an increase of 6.7 percent compared to sales of $425.8 million for the four-week period ending November 2, 2002.

By merchandise category, same store sales increased in Cosmetics, Accessories, Shoes, Men's Wear and Women's Designer Apparel. Preliminary third quarter sales of $1,420.6 million increased 9.8 percent compared to third quarter 2002 sales of $1,293.5 million. Third quarter same- store sales increased 5.0 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $4.5 billion increased 7.2 percent compared to year-to-date 2002 sales of $4.2 billion. Year-to-date same-store sales increased 2.6 percent. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded October sales message, please dial (402) 220- 6036. This recording will be available for one week. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. This change in the fiscal calendar has resulted in differences in the number of days included in the current period versus the same period in the prior year. Sales performance numbers included in this sales release have been calculated on a comparative 4-5-4 basis. The Company believes that adjusting for these differences provides a more comparable basis (4-5-4 vs. 4-5-4) from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges 2002 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
