Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - ---------------------- November 20, 2003 NORDSTROM THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 147 PERCENT ----------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - November 20, 2003 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $45.5 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2003, which ended November 1, 2003. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $18.4 million and $0.14, respectively. On a comparable 4-5-4 basis, net sales for the third quarter of 2003 increased 9.8 percent, to $1.4 billion, compared to sales of $1.3 billion in the same period last year. Third quarter 2003 same-store sales increased 5.0 percent. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Earnings increased 147 percent in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, as the company continues to focus on improving merchandising assortments, inventory productivity and expense management. The better-than-expected performance reflected continued operating improvements consistent with the company's key strategic initiatives. - Same-store sales increased 5.0 percent, better than the company's plan of a low single digit increase. - Gross profit improved due to a combination of strong sales and lower- than-plan markdowns. - Selling, general and administrative expense dollars were as expected for the quarter; sales leverage resulted in significant expense rate improvement. YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings and earnings per share for the period ended November 1, 2003, were $138.5 million and $1.01, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of $30.2 million and $0.22 for the same period in 2002. Excluding $71.0 million (net of tax) in non-recurring and impairment charges(1), year-to-date 2002 net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $101.2 million and $0.75, respectively. On a comparable 4-5-4 basis, year-to-date net sales of $4.5 billion increased 7.2 percent from the same period in 2002. Year-to-date same store sales increased 2.6 percent. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. This change in the fiscal calendar has resulted in differences in the number of
days included in the current period versus the same period in the prior year. Sales performance numbers included in this release have been calculated on a comparative 4-5-4 basis. The Company believes that adjusting for these differences provides a more comparable basis (4-5-4 vs. 4-5-4) from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges 2002 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales. EXPANSION UPDATE During the third quarter of 2003 Nordstrom opened four stores: two full- line stores, one in Austin, Texas, and the other in Richmond, Va. and two Rack stores in Chicago, Ill. and Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. The final new store planned for this year was opened November 14th in Wellington Green, Fla. Gross square footage for the year is expected to increase approximately 4.0 percent, from 18,428,000 to 19,131,000. 2003 OUTLOOK The Company is providing the following 2003 forecasts:
