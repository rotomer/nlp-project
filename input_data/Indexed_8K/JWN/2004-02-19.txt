Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- February 19, 2004 NORDSTROM FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 74 PERCENT ----------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - February 19, 2004 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $104.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, which ended January 31, 2004. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $60.0 million and $0.44, respectively. On a comparable 4-5-4 basis, total sales for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 12.0 percent, to $1.9 billion, compared to sales of $1.7 billion in the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2003 same-store sales increased 8.5 percent. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS The company's key strategic initiatives continue to generate operating improvements, resulting in a 74 percent increase in fourth quarter earnings compared to the prior year. - Same-store sales increased 8.5 percent; better than the company's plan of a two to four percent increase. - Gross profit improved 350 basis points, driven by strong sell through and significant improvement in markdowns. - Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points as a result of higher than expected performance based incentive compensation expense. All other expense components continue to trend favorably, collectively improving 100 basis points. FULL YEAR RESULTS Fiscal 2003 net earnings and earnings per share for the period ended January 31,2004, were $242.8 million and $1.76, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of $90.2 million and $0.66 for the same period in fiscal 2002. Excluding $71.0 million (net of tax) in non-recurring and impairment charges (1),fiscal 2002 net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $161.3 million and $1.19, respectively. 2003 earnings increased 51 percent over 2002, excluding non-recurring and impairment charges, reflecting continuing improvement in all key areas of the business. Ongoing refinement of the merchandise assortments, coupled with better disciplines in inventory planning and control, have resulted in stores having more of the right merchandise. The company saw the strongest comp-store sales and gross margin performance in ten years, and expenses improved on a percent to sales basis for the third consecutive year.
On a comparable 4-5-4 basis, 2003 total sales of $6.5 billion increased 8.6 percent from the same period in 2002. Full year same-store sales increased 4.3 percent. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. This change in the fiscal calendar has resulted in differences in the number of days included in the current period versus the same period in the prior year. Sales performance numbers included in this sales release have been calculated on a comparative 4-5-4 basis. The Company believes that adjusting for these differences provides a more comparable basis (4-5-4 vs. 4-5-4) from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges 2002 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales. EXPANSION UPDATE During fiscal 2003 Nordstrom opened four full-line stores and two Rack stores. Gross square footage for the year increased approximately 4.0 percent, from 18,428,000 to 19,138,000. 2004 OUTLOOK The company is providing the following 2004 forecasts: Note: First quarter projections include a $16 to $18 million increase in Interest expense related to the previously announced debt retirement scheduled to take place during the first quarter. This additional expense will lower first quarter earnings per share approximately $0.08. This debt retirement will lower future interest expense resulting in approximately $0.02 of earnings benefit in each subsequent quarter.
