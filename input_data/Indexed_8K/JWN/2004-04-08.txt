Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- April 8, 2004 NORDSTROM MARCH SAME-STORE SALES INCREASE 15.9 PERCENT ------------------------------------------------------ SEATTLE - April 8, 2004 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $620.8 million for the five-week period ending April 3, 2004, an increase of 19.8 percent compared to sales of $518.2 million for the five-week period ending April 5, 2003. Same-store sales increased 15.9 percent. March same-store sales in full-line stores increased in all geographic regions and all merchandise categories. Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.1 billion increased 18.8 percent compared to sales of $0.9 billion in 2003. Quarter-to-date same-store sales increased 14.9 percent. FIRST QUARTER GUIDANCE Based on quarter-to-date sales and gross profit performance, the Company is now expecting first quarter earnings per share to exceed prior guidance of $0.23 to $0.28. As a percent to sales, quarter to date gross profit is trending over 200 basis points higher than the prior year. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded March sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. The first quarter of 2003 includes one more day than the first quarter of 2004. The Company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the quarter-to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales. FUTURE REPORTING DATES Nordstrom's financial release calendar for the next several months is provided in the table below.
