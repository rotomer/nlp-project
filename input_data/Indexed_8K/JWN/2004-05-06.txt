Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- May 6, 2004 NORDSTROM APRIL SAME-STORE SALES INCREASE 10.0% PERCENT ------------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - May 6, 2004 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $491.7 million for the four-week period ending May 1, 2004, an increase of 12.4 percent compared to sales of $437.5 million for the four-week period ending May 3, 2003. Same-store sales increased 10.0 percent. April same-store sales in full-line stores increased in all geographic regions and all major merchandise categories. Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.5 billion increased 16.6 percent compared to sales of $1.3 billion in 2003. Quarter-to-date same-store sales increased 13.2 percent. FIRST QUARTER GUIDANCE Nordstrom is raising its first quarter earnings expectations to reflect strong sales and gross profit performance. The company now expects earnings to exceed $0.40 per diluted share for the quarter compared to $0.20 last year. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded April sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. The first quarter of 2003 includes one more day than the first quarter of 2004. The Company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the quarter-to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales. FUTURE REPORTING DATES Nordstrom's financial release calendar for the next several months is provided in the table below.
