Same-store sales increased 9.4 percent. During the month of May, same-store sales in full-line stores increased in all geographic regions and all major merchandise categories.

SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded May sales message, please dial (402) 220- 6036. This recording will be available for one week. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. The year-to-date for 2003 includes one more day than the year-to-date for 2004. The Company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the year- to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
