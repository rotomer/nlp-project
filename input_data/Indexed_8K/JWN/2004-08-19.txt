Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 19, 2004 NORDSTROM SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 62 PERCENT ----------------------------------------------------- Board Approves Quarterly Dividend Increase of 18 Percent SEATTLE - August 19, 2004 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $106.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, ahead of company guidance of $0.70 to $0.74. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $65.9 million and $0.48, respectively. Total sales for the second quarter of 2004 increased 9.4 percent, to $2.0 billion, compared to sales of $1.8 billion in the same period last year. Second quarter same-store sales increased 6.8 percent. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Second quarter earnings increased 62 percent, reflecting ongoing improvement in merchandise execution, inventory management and expense control. Results can also be attributed to a successful Anniversary Sale, as this event has a significant impact on overall quarterly performance. The company is committed to delivering superior fundamental performance in all aspects of its business. - Same-store sales were better than plan increasing 6.8 percent for the quarter. Color, newness and fashion drove strong regular price selling across all categories and price points. - As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 180 basis points due to strong sell-through resulting in lower markdowns compared to the prior year. - Selling, general and administrative expenses improved 20 basis points compared to last year due to leverage on core operating expenses. FULL YEAR RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings increased 89 percent to $175.6 million for the period ended July 31, 2004, compared to net earnings of $93.0 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the same periods were $1.23 and $0.68, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 11.8 percent to $3.5 billion compared to prior year sales of $3.1 billion. Same-store sales increased 9.5 percent. EXPANSION UPDATE During the second quarter Nordstrom did not open any stores. The company plans to open one additional store this year; a full-line store at Dadeland Mall in Miami scheduled to open in November. Gross square footage for the year is expected to increase approximately 2 percent, from 19,138,000 to 19,439,000.
QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, an increase of 18 percent or $0.02 per share from prior quarters, payable on September 15, 2004, to shareholders of record on August 31, 2004. 2004 OUTLOOK The company is providing the following third quarter forecast as well as raising full-year expectations from previously stated guidance of $2.42 - $2.46: CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION: Company management will be hosting a conference call and webcast to discuss second quarter results at 4:15p.m. (EDT) today. Access to the conference call is open to the press and general public in a listen only mode. To participate, please dial, 517-319-9282 ten minutes prior to the call (passcode: NORD). A telephone replay will be available for 48 hours beginning approximately one hour after the conclusion of the call by dialing 866-499- 4574. Interested parties may also access the call over the Internet by visiting the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at http://about.nordstrom.com/aboutus/investor/webcasts.asp. An archived version of the webcast will be available at this location for 30 days. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. Year-to-date results for 2003 includes one more day than the year-to-date for 2004. The company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the year- to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
