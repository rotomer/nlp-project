Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- November 16, 2004 NORDSTROM THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 71 PERCENT ---------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - November 16, 2004 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $77.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, which was ahead of expectations. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $45.5 million and $0.33, respectively. Total sales for the third quarter of 2004 increased 9.4 percent, to $1.5 billion, compared to sales of $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Third quarter same-store sales increased 8.1 percent. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Earnings increased 71 percent in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, as the company continues to focus on merchandising improvements, inventory productivity and expense management. The better-than- expected performance reflects ongoing operating improvements consistent with the company's key strategic initiatives. - Same-store sales increased 8.1 percent, better than the company's plan of a low single digit increase. The company continues to see strong customer response to fashion, color and newness across all categories and price points. - As a percent to sales, gross profit improved 80 basis points primarily as a result of sales leverage on buying and occupancy expenses. - Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 90 basis points compared to last year due to leverage on core operating expenses. During the quarter, the company completed a review of its current and deferred tax liabilities, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate. This change increased net income per diluted share approximately $0.02 for the quarter. FULL YEAR RESULTS Through October 30, 2004, year-to-date net earnings increased 83 percent to $253.5 million compared to net earnings of $138.5 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for these periods were $1.77 and $1.01, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 11.1 percent to $5.0 billion compared to prior year sales of $4.5 billion. Same-store sales increased 9.1 percent.
SHARE REPURCHASE As part of its recently announced share repurchase program, Nordstrom repurchased 2 million shares of common stock during the third quarter for a total of $75 million. This did not materially impact earnings per share for the quarter, as the impact on weighted average shares outstanding was insignificant. EXPANSION UPDATE During the third quarter Nordstrom did not open any stores. The final new store planned for this year opened November 12th at Dadeland Mall in Miami, increasing gross square footage for the year approximately 2 percent to 19,439,000. 2004 OUTLOOK The company is providing the following fourth quarter forecast as well as raising full-year expectations to $2.68 - $2.73 from the previously stated forecast of $2.46 -$2.50: CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION: Company management will be hosting a conference call and webcast to discuss third quarter results at 4:30p.m. (EST) today.

GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. Year-to-date results for 2003 include one more day than the year-to-date for 2004. The company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the year- to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
