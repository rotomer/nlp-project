(NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $667.6 million for the four-week period ending November 27, 2004, an increase of 6.2 percent compared to sales of $628.4 million for the four-week period ending November 29, 2003.

Year-to-date same-store sales increased 8.4 percent. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded November sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week. GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The Company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. Year-to-date results for 2003 include one more day than the year-to-date for 2004. The Company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges the year- to-date 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5-4 comparable sales.
