You will also be eligible for these additional leadership benefits: Leadership level benefits program, which is an enhancement of the basic disability and life insurance coverage.

Paul Favaro November 22, 2004 Page Three It is important to note that Nordstrom is an at-will employer. Nothing in this letter constitutes an employment contract. If there is a discrepancy between information in this letter and any official plan documents for contract, the official document will determine how the plans work and benefits are paid. Ideally we would agree to these terms in the course of the next 30 days to implement a smooth and proper transition into this new role for 2005. We also understand that you would be relocating to Seattle as soon as possible, which would be at the end of the school year. In the interim we agree that you will utilize our Michigan Avenue store as home base and will continue to spend the appropriate time here in Seattle. Paul, we are excited about you joining Nordstrom!
