Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- February 15, 2005 NORDSTROM FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 34 PERCENT ----------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - February 15, 2005 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $140.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. Fourth quarter 2004 net earnings were reduced $4.7 million or $0.03 per share due to a non-cash expense adjustment related to a correction in the company's lease accounting policy(1). Excluding this adjustment, 2004 fourth quarter net earnings were $144.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $104.3 million and $0.74, respectively. Total sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 9.4 percent, to a record $2.1 billion, compared to sales of $1.9 billion in the same period last year. Fourth quarter same-store sales increased 7.2 percent. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Continued focus on offering customers compelling fashion merchandise and improving operating efficiency resulted in a 34 percent increase in fourth quarter earnings compared to the prior year. The company remains committed to providing an exceptional shopping experience and delivering superior financial performance. - Same-store sales increased 7.2 percent for the quarter, which was better than the company's plan. All geographic regions and merchandise categories achieved same-store sales increases. - As a percent to sales, gross profit improved 40 basis points. Excluding the $7.8 million lease adjustment(1), gross profit increased 80 basis points, primarily as a result of sales leverage on buying and occupancy expenses. - Continued focus on expense management, combined with higher than plan sales resulted in a 160 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. FULL YEAR RESULTS For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, net earnings increased 62 percent to $393.5 million compared to net earnings of $242.8 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for these periods were $2.77 and $1.76, respectively. For the year total sales increased 10.6 percent to $7.1 billion compared to prior year sales of $6.4 billion. Same-store sales increased 8.5 percent. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom completed its $300 million share repurchase authorization during the quarter, repurchasing 5.0 million shares of common stock for a total of $225 million. The resulting reduction of weighted average shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.04 for the quarter and $0.03 for the full- year. EXPANSION UPDATE During fiscal 2004 Nordstrom opened two full-line stores, one in Charlotte, N.C. and the other in Miami, Fla. Gross square footage for the year increased approximately 1.4 percent to 19,397,000. During the first quarter of 2005, Nordstrom plans to open one store at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, Ga., and relocate a Rack store in Portland, Ore.
QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share payable on March 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2005. 2005 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006, the company anticipates diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.25 to $3.35, a 16 to 20 percent increase over the prior year, excluding the lease adjustment from 2004 earnings per share. This would reflect low single-digit same-store sales growth and improvement in both gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. For the first quarter, the company expects low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 - $0.67.

GAAP SALES PERFORMANCE The additional information provided in this section is to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The company converted to a 4-5-4 Retail Calendar at the beginning of 2003. Full-year results for 2003 include one more day than 2004. The company believes that adjusting for this difference provides a more comparable basis from which to evaluate sales performance. The following reconciliation bridges 2003 GAAP sales to the 4-5- 4 comparable sales.
