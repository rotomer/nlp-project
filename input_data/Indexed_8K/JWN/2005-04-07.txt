This recording will be available for one week. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Restatements Tomorrow, April 8, 2005, Nordstrom is planning to file an amended Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2004, along with an accompanying Form 8-K report, in order to correct two errors in previously issued balance sheet and cash flow statements. The corrections relate to an evaluation of Nordstrom's lease accounting policy, which was first announced along with fourth quarter earnings in February. Previously reported net earnings, earnings per share, shareholders' equity and long-term debt are not impacted by these corrections. (1) Effective February 2005, Nordstrom Direct sales, which include catalog and Internet, are included in Total Retail same-store sales. To serve as a basis for comparison, as this was not the case last year, a presentation of 2004 monthly, quarterly and full-year same-store sales that includes Nordstrom Direct is available on the Investor Relations homepage of our website under Recent Reports.
