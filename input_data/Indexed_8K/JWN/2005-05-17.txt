Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- May 17, 2005 NORDSTROM REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE ------------------------------------------------- Board Approves Quarterly Dividend Increase of 31 Percent SEATTLE - May 17, 2005 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $104.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended April 30, 2005, ahead of expectations. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $68.7 million and $0.48, respectively. 2004 first quarter results include $20.8 million or $0.08 per share of interest expense related to retirement of debt during the quarter. Total sales for the first quarter of 2005 increased 7.7 percent, to $1.7 billion, compared to sales of $1.5 billion in the same period last year. First quarter same-store sales increased 6.2 percent. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS First quarter earnings per share increased 56 percent, reflecting ongoing improvement in merchandise execution, inventory productivity and expense management. These key areas of focus support the Company's goals of providing a differentiated shopping experience and delivering superior long-term financial performance. - Same-store sales were strong throughout the quarter, increasing 6.2 percent on top of a 14 percent increase the prior year. Underlying sales trends remain strong as demonstrated by same-store sales increases across regions and categories. - Gross profit, as a percent to sales, increased 20 basis points. Better than plan sales resulted in incremental leverage on buying and occupancy expenses, offsetting slightly lower merchandise margin. - Selling general and administrative expenses improved 130 basis points as a percent to sales. The company continues to demonstrate good progress improving its operating performance. For the quarter, fixed expenses were maintained at or below budgeted levels. EXPANSION UPDATE During the first quarter Nordstrom opened one full-line store at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, Ga. and relocated a Rack store in Portland, Ore. The company plans to open three additional full-line stores this year. A store in San Antonio, Texas at the La Cantera Shopping Center and a store in Irvine, Calif. at The Irvine Spectrum will open in September. The final opening of the year will be in November in Dallas, Texas at NorthPark Center. Gross square footage for the year is expected to increase approximately 2 percent, from 19,550,000 to 20,019,000. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, an increase of 31 percent or $0.04 per share from prior quarters, payable on June 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on May 31, 2005.
SHARE REPURCHASE As part of its recently announced share repurchase program, Nordstrom repurchased approximately 887,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter for a total of $47.7 million. This did not materially impact earnings per share for the quarter, as the impact on weighted average shares outstanding was insignificant. 2005 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006, the company is raising its prior earnings per share outlook of $3.25-$3.35 to $3.40-$3.50. This represents a 20 to 25 percent increase over the prior year, excluding the lease adjustment from 2004 earnings per share. For the second quarter, the company expects low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.85-$0.90.
