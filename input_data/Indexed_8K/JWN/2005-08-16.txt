Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 16, 2005 NORDSTROM SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 39 PERCENT ----------------------------------------------------- SEATTLE - August 16, 2005 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $148.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $106.9 million and $0.37, respectively. Total sales for the second quarter of 2005 increased 7.8 percent, to $2.1 billion, compared to sales of $2.0 billion in the same period last year. Second quarter same-store sales increased 6.2 percent. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Earnings increased 39 percent in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year, ahead of company expectations. Results reflect ongoing merchandise execution, inventory productivity and expense management improvements. The company continues to focus on providing a differentiated shopping experience and delivering superior long-term financial performance. - Same-store sales were better than the company's plan, increasing 6.2 percent for the quarter. Regular price selling was strong throughout the quarter and the initial response to fall merchandise was favorable. - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points due to strong sell through and a lower markdown rate compared to the prior year. - Disciplined expense management, combined with higher than plan sales, resulted in a 120 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. FULL YEAR RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings increased 44 percent to $253.5 million for the period ended July 30, 2005, compared to net earnings of $175.6 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the same periods were $0.91 and $0.62, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 7.8 percent to $3.8 billion compared to prior year sales of $3.5 billion. Same-store sales increased 6.2 percent. EXPANSION UPDATE No new stores were opened during the second quarter. Throughout the remainder of the year, the company plans to open three full-line stores. Stores will open in San Antonio, Texas at The Shops at La Cantera on September 16th and in Irvine, Calif. at The Irvine Spectrum on September 30th. The final opening of the year will be on November 11th in Dallas, Texas at NorthPark Center. Gross square footage for the year is expected to increase approximately 3.4 percent, from 19,397,000 to 20,048,000. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share, payable on September 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on August 31, 2005. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 917,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter for a total of $26 million. This did not materially impact earnings per share for the quarter, as the impact on weighted average shares outstanding was insignificant.
2005 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006, the company is raising its prior earnings per share outlook of $1.70-$1.75 to $1.80-$1.90. This represents a 30 to 38 percent increase over the prior year. For the third quarter, the company expects three to five percent same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.30-$0.35.
