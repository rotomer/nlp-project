Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- November 17, 2005 NORDSTROM REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 39 CENTS SEATTLE - November 17, 2005 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $107.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $77.8 million and $0.27, respectively. Total sales for the third quarter of 2005 increased 8.0 percent, to $1.7 billion, compared to sales of $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Third quarter same-store sales increased 5.9 percent. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net earnings increased 38 percent in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting strong sales momentum and ongoing operating improvements. The company remains committed to providing a differentiated shopping experience and delivering superior long-term financial performance. - Same-store sales increased 5.9 percent for the quarter, higher than the company's 3 to 5 percent same-store sales guidance. - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 34 basis points, primarily as a result of sales leverage on buying and occupancy expenses. - Disciplined expense management, combined with higher than plan sales, resulted in a 130 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. - Income tax expense was reduced $6.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, due to the final determination of the company's fiscal 2004 tax expense and the completion of tax return audits for earlier years. YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings increased 42 percent to $360.9 million for the period ended October 29, 2005, compared to net earnings of $253.5 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the same periods were $1.30 and $0.89, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 7.9 percent to $5.4 billion compared to prior year sales of $5.0 billion. Same-store sales increased 6.1 percent. EXPANSION UPDATE During the third quarter Nordstrom opened two full-line stores: one in San Antonio, Texas at The Shops at La Cantera, and the other in Irvine, Calif. at The Irvine Spectrum. The final new store planned for this year was opened November 11th in Dallas, Texas at the NorthPark Center. Gross square footage for the year has increased approximately 3.4 percent, from 19,397,000 to 20,058,000. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share, payable on December 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on November 30, 2005. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 4,703,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter for a total of $172.4 million. The resulting reduction in weighted average shares outstanding increased diluted earnings per share approximately $0.01 for the quarter.
2005 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006, the company is raising its prior earnings per share outlook of $1.80-$1.90 to $1.90-$1.95. This would represent a 38 to 41 percent increase over the prior year. For the fourth quarter, the company expects low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.65.
