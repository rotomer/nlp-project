Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- February 23, 2006 NORDSTROM REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 69 CENTS SEATTLE - February 23, 2006 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $190.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $140.0 million and $0.50, respectively. Total sales for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 9.3 percent, to $2.3 billion, compared to sales of $2.1 billion in the same period last year. Fourth quarter same-store sales increased 5.8 percent. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net earnings increased 36 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting strong sales momentum and ongoing operating improvements. The company remains committed to providing a differentiated shopping experience and delivering superior long-term financial performance. - - Same-store sales increased 5.8 percent for the quarter, higher than the company's one to three percent same-store sales guidance. Continued improvement in regular price sales throughout the quarter and a successful Men's Half-Yearly clearance event drove the sales increase. - - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 81 basis points. This improvement was a result of sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs. - - The same-store sales increase combined with expense control resulted in a 70 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. FULL YEAR RESULTS For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, net earnings increased 40 percent to $551.3 million compared to net earnings of $393.5 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the same periods were $1.98 and $1.38, respectively. Total sales for the year increased 8.3 percent to $7.7 billion compared to prior year sales of $7.1 billion. Same-store sales increased 6.0 percent. EXPANSION UPDATE During the fourth quarter Nordstrom opened one full-line store in Dallas, Texas at The North Park Center. Gross square footage for the year has increased approximately 3.5 percent, from 19,397,000 to 20,070,000. On March 10, 2006, the company plans to open one store at The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach, Fla. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter for $40.8 million. This reduction in weighted average shares outstanding had no effect on diluted earnings per share for the quarter.
2006 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2007, the company anticipates diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15 to $2.23, which includes an estimated expense of $0.06 per diluted share from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) regarding expensing of stock options. For the first quarter, the company expects low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.39 to $0.44.
