For Immediate Release - --------------------- May 18, 2006 NORDSTROM REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 48 CENTS SEATTLE - May 18, 2006 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $131.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended April 29, 2006. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $104.5 million and $0.38, respectively. Total sales for the first quarter of 2006 increased 8.0 percent to $1.8 billion, compared to sales of $1.7 billion in the same period last year. First quarter same-store sales increased 5.4 percent. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net earnings increased 25.5 percent in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting continued progress in merchandise execution, inventory management and expense control. The company remains committed to providing a superior shopping experience and achieving long-term profitable growth. - Same-store sales increased 5.4 percent for the quarter, higher than the company's one to three percent same-store sales guidance. Merchandise divisions with performance above the company's average were accessories, cosmetics and men's apparel. - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 40 basis points. Better than plan sales resulted in incremental leverage on buying and occupancy expenses, while overall merchandise margin remained flat versus last year. - The same-store sales increase combined with expense control resulted in a 48 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. For the quarter, fixed expenses were maintained at or below budgeted levels. - We adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," and as a result we recorded compensation expense of $2.7 million in buying and occupancy costs and $4.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. EXPANSION UPDATE During the first quarter Nordstrom opened one full-line store in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida at the Gardens Mall on March 10th. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter for $212.9 million. This reduction in weighted- average shares outstanding had no material impact on diluted earnings per share for the quarter. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The company's board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.105 per share, payable on June 15, 2006, to shareholders of record on May 31, 2006. 2006 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2007, the company anticipates diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.24 to $2.32, which includes an estimated expense of $0.06 per diluted share from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) regarding expensing of stock options. For the second quarter, the company expects low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.59 to $0.64.
