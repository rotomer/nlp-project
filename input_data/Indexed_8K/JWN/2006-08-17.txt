Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 17, 2006 NORDSTROM REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 67 CENTS SEATTLE - August 17, 2006 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $178.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended July 29, 2006. For the same period last year, net earnings were $148.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. Total sales for the second quarter of 2006 increased 7.8 percent to $2.3 billion, compared to sales of $2.1 billion in the same period last year. Second quarter same-store sales increased 5.7 percent. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net earnings increased 20.0 percent in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting steady improvement in merchandise execution, inventory productivity, and expense leverage, as well as a one-time Visa/Master card settlement gain. The company continues to focus on providing a differentiated shopping experience and achieving long-term profitable growth. - Same-store sales increased 5.7 percent for the quarter, higher than the company's one to three percent same-store sales plan. Regular price selling was strong during the quarter and the initial response to fall merchandise was favorable. The following full-line store merchandise divisions performed above the company's average: intimate apparel, accessories, designer apparel, and cosmetics. Also notable, same-store sales in the Rack division increased 11.6 percent. - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 26 basis points. Overall merchandise margin improved versus the prior year. Better than planned sales results drove incremental leverage on buying and occupancy expenses. - The same-store sales increase combined with overall on-plan expenses resulted in a 64 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a percent to sales basis. - As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," we recorded compensation expense of $2.6 million in buying and occupancy costs and $4.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. - The company received a one-time payment of $5.6 million related to the Visa/MasterCard settlement gain, which was recorded in other income. FULL YEAR RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings increased 22.3 percent to $310.0 million for the period ended July 29, 2006, compared to net earnings of $253.5 million for the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share for the same periods were $1.15 and $0.91, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 7.9 percent to $4.1 billion compared to prior year sales of $3.8 billion. Same-store sales increased 5.6 percent. EXPANSION UPDATE No new stores were opened during the second quarter. The company will open a new relocated store at the Westfield Topanga mall in Woodland Hills, Calif., on October 6th.
SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter for $350.0 million. This reduction in weighted- average shares outstanding had a $0.01 impact on diluted earnings per share for the quarter. 2006 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2007, the company now anticipates diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.31 to $2.39, which includes an estimated expense of $0.06 per diluted share from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) regarding expensing of stock options. For the third quarter, the company is planning low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.40 to $0.45.
