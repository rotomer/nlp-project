Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- November 20, 2006 NORDSTROM REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 33 PERCENT SEATTLE - November 20, 2006 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $135.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the third quarter ended October 28, 2006. For the same period last year, net earnings were $107.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. Total sales for the third quarter of 2006 increased 12.4 percent to $1.9 billion, compared to sales of $1.7 billion in the same period last year. Third quarter same-store sales increased 10.7 percent. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net earnings increased 26.3 percent in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the company's improved execution of its merchandising strategy. The company continues to focus on providing customers with compelling merchandise and superior service. - Same-store sales increased 10.7 percent for the quarter. All major merchandise categories performed above the company's low single digit growth plan. Results in intimate apparel, accessories, women's better and designer apparel exceeded the company's overall percentage increase. The company's Direct and Rack channels achieved double digit same-store sales increases. - Gross profit as a percent of sales increased 156 basis points versus the prior year. Merchandise margin improved versus the prior year driven primarily by lower markdowns, particularly in women's apparel. Above plan sales results created incremental leverage on buying and occupancy expenses. - Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent to sales decreased 17 basis points versus the prior year. Total sales growth outpaced an increase in general and administrative expenses. Further rate improvement was held back by a rise in compensation costs linked to the price of the company's stock, which appreciated 38.4 percent in the quarter. This cost increase impacted the total SG&A expense rate by 64 basis points, and diluted earnings per share by $0.03 for the quarter. - As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," the company recorded $6.5 million in compensation expense, which resulted in a $0.01 impact on diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Of the total expense, $2.9 million was recorded in buying and occupancy and $3.6 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS Year-to-date net earnings increased 23.5 percent to $445.7 million for the three quarters ended October 28, 2006, compared to net earnings of $360.9 million for the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share for the same periods were $1.67 and $1.30, respectively. Year-to-date total sales increased 9.3 percent to $5.9 billion compared to prior year sales of $5.4 billion. Same-store sales increased 7.2 percent. EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT UPDATE Nordstrom opened its newly relocated store at Westfield Topanga Mall in Canoga Park, Calif., on October 6, 2006. The 213,000 square foot, three-level store features the company's most comprehensive designer offering in the country along with new design concepts, amenities and services. The company opened a new 35,000 square foot Nordstrom Rack store at Grand Plaza in San Marcos, Calif., on November 16, 2006.
Nordstrom announced plans today to open three new stores and for one store relocation. - In the spring of 2009, Nordstrom will open a newly relocated 140,000 square foot store at the Fashion Place, in Murray, Utah. - In the fall of 2009, Nordstrom will open a new 140,000 square foot store at the Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, Ohio. - In the spring of 2010, Nordstrom will open a new 140,000 square foot store at the St. Louis Galleria in St. Louis, Missouri. - In the spring of 2011, Nordstrom will open a new 140,000 square foot store at the Christiana Mall in Wilmington, Delaware. Nordstrom's board of directors recently approved the company's budget for capital expenditures for the 2007 through 2011 fiscal years. The total amount planned is for $2.8 billion over the five years, with approximately 80% of the capital allocated to new stores, store relocations and store remodels. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 896,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter for $32.6 million. This reduction in weighted- average shares outstanding had no material impact on diluted earnings per share for the quarter. 2006 OUTLOOK For the 53 week fiscal year ending February 3, 2007, the company now anticipates diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.46 to $2.51, including an estimated expense of $0.06 per diluted share for stock option compensation following the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) at the beginning of this fiscal year. For the 14 week fourth quarter, the company is planning low single digit same-store sales growth and earnings per share in the range of $0.79 to $0.84. Under the 4-5-4 retail calendar, the 2006 fourth quarter and fiscal year include an additional week.
