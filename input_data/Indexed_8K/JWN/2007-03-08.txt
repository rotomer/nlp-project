Koppel Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Dated: March 8, 2007 EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom February 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated March 8, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- March 8, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR FEBRUARY INCREASE 9.1 PERCENT SEATTLE - March 8, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $546.6 million for the four-week period ending March 3, 2007, an increase of 9.5 percent compared to sales of $499.1 million for the four-week period ending February 25, 2006. Same-store sales increased 9.1 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 creates a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007. The month of February in fiscal 2007 began and ended one week later than in fiscal 2006. This timing shift positively impacted reported sales results for February 2007. Throughout the remainder of the 2007 fiscal year, this timing shift is anticipated to impact the cadence of monthly same-store sales results, because normal sales trends, events and holiday periods are aligned differently than last year. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded February sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week.
