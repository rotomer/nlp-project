EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom March 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated April 12, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- April 12, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR MARCH INCREASE 15.0 PERCENT SEATTLE - April 12, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $803.2 million for the five-week period ending April 7, 2007, an increase of 14.2 percent compared to sales of $703.2 million for the five-week period ending April 1, 2006. Same-store sales increased 15.0 percent. Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.35 billion increased 12.3 percent compared to sales of $1.20 billion in 2006. Quarter-to-date same-store sales increased 12.6 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 created a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007. The month of March in fiscal 2007 began and ended one week later than in fiscal 2006. This timing shift positively impacted reported sales results for March 2007, and is expected to have a negative impact on April 2007 sales results. We expect the same-store sales rate for April 2007 to be below the first quarter 2007 planned mid-single digit growth rate. Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2007, the timing shift caused by the 53rd week in fiscal 2006 is anticipated to impact the cadence of monthly same-store sales results, because normal sales trends, events and holiday periods are aligned differently than last year. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded March sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week. (1) Same-store sales results exclude the impact of the January 2007 closure of the Crossroads Plaza Mall full-line store in Salt Lake City, Utah, in preparation for its planned relocation in 2011. Total sales results include the impact of this store closure. FUTURE REPORTING DATES Nordstrom's financial release calendar for the next three months is currently planned as follows: April Sales Release Thurs., May 10, 2007 First Quarter Earnings Thurs., May 17, 2007 May Sales Release Thurs., June 7, 2007 June Sales Release Thurs., July 12, 2007
