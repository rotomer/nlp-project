(viii) under Section 3805(b) of the Statutory Trust Act, no creditor of the holder of the Trust Certificate shall have any right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the Issuer except in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement;
(ix) under Section 3808(a) and (b) of the Statutory Trust Act, the Issuer may not be terminated or revoked by the Beneficiary (as defined in the Trust Agreement), and the dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of any holder of the Trust Certificate shall not result in the termination or dissolution of the Issuer, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement;

(xiii) the corpus of the Issuer is not subject to any personal property or similar ad valorem tax imposed by the State of Delaware;
 
(xiv) the characterization of the Issuer for federal income tax purposes, whether as a trust, partnership or association taxable as a corporation, is determinative of the character of the Issuer for State of Delaware income tax purposes, and, if the Issuer is characterized as a partnership for State of Delaware income tax purposes, no State of Delaware income tax is imposed upon the Issuer. For State of Delaware income tax purposes, taxable income would be derived from "federal taxable income," and for the purpose of ascertaining such taxable income for State of Delaware income tax purposes, the amount of federal taxable income as determined for federal income tax purposes would be determinative, whether such amount of federal taxable income is determined upon a characterization of the transaction as a sale or as a loan;
(xv) there is no stamp, documentary or other excise tax imposed by the State of Delaware upon the Notes;
(xvi) there is no income tax imposed by New Castle County, Delaware, upon the Issuer and New Castle County, Delaware, is prohibited by Delaware State law from imposing a personal property tax upon or measured by the corpus of the Issuer; and

(p) the Representatives shall have received a signed agreed-upon procedures letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP regarding the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives.
Any opinion requirement set forth above may be modified in a manner reasonably agreed to by the addressee thereof. The Bank, the Seller and the Transferor will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request.
 
10. 
Indemnification.
(a) Each of the Bank, the Seller and the Transferor, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and the respective officers, directors and employees of each such person, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Initial Purchaser or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Circular (it being understood that such indemnification with respect to the Preliminary Offering Circular does not include the omission of information regarding the final amount of the Offered Notes (as reflected in the Final Offering Circular) or pricing and price-dependent information, which information shall of necessity appear only in the Final Offering Circular), the Other Materials, the Final Offering Circular or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Initial Purchaser and each such officer, director, employee or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser and each such officer, director, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that none of the Bank, the Seller nor the Transferor will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with the Initial Purchasers Information. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor may otherwise have.
provided, however,
(b) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Bank, the Seller and the Transferor, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and the respective officers, directors and employees of each such person against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Bank , the Seller or the Transferor or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Other Materials or the Final Offering Circular or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Other Materials or the Final Offering Circular in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor by such Initial Purchaser expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel reasonably incurred by the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor in any action or proceeding between the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor and such Initial Purchaser or between the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor and any third party or otherwise) or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that such Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission and/or delay so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party hereunder to the extent such omission and/or delay did not cause actual material prejudice to the indemnifying party and in any event shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notified the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel, if any, retained by the indemnified party pursuant to the following sentence. If (i) the defendants in any action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (ii) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel (based upon such counsel's determination) with a conflict of interest, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the institution of such action, or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party in writing to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to appoint separate counsel (at the expense of the indemnifying party) to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties; that in no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in connection with any one action or separate but similar related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment in, any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) does not include a statement as to fault, culpability or a failure to act by such indemnified party and (ii) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its consent.
provided, however,
 
(d) If recovery is not available to an indemnified party under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section for any reason other than as specified therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provisions incurred by such indemnified party (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Bank, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Offered Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Bank on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Bank on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the sale of the Offered Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Bank and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Notes. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Bank and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total purchase price of the Offered Notes purchased by such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to the amount of Offered Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, and not joint.
11.  If any Class A Initial Purchaser or Class A Initial Purchasers purchasing Class A Notes, or any Class B Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchasers purchasing Class B Notes, default in their obligations to purchase such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, under this Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed, but failed, to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, as applicable, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the purchase of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, by other persons, including any of the Initial Purchasers, but if no such arrangements are made within a period of 36 hours after the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Class A Initial Purchasers or Class B Initial Purchasers, as applicable, shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective total commitments under this Agreement, to purchase such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, which such defaulting Initial Purchaser Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Class A Initial
Default of Initial Purchasers.
 
or Class A Initial Purchasers, or any Class B Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchasers, so default and the aggregate principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than 10% of the total principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Bank for the purchase of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Class A Initial Purchasers or Class B Initial Purchasers, as applicable, or the Bank, except as provided in Section 13. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes any person substituted for a Class A Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchaser, as applicable, under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability for its default.
12.  The obligation of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Offered Notes on the Closing Date shall be terminable by such Initial Purchasers by written notice delivered to the Bank if at any time on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, or there shall have been any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York or Arizona shall have been declared by any of Federal, New York or Arizona authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, impracticable to market the Offered Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Offering Circular or (iv) any change or any development involving a prospective change occurs, materially and adversely affecting (A) the Collateral taken as a whole or (B) the business or properties of the Bank, the Transferor or the Issuer, which, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, in the case of either (A) or (B), makes it impracticable to market the Offered Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Offering Circular.
Termination of the Obligations of the Initial Purchasers.
13.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements by the Bank or its officers and of the several Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, the Bank or any of their respective officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive the issuance of and payment for any Offered Notes.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 or Section 12 or if for any reason the purchase of any Offered Notes by the Initial Purchasers is not consummated, the Bank shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 8(g), and the obligations of the Bank and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 10 shall remain in effect.

Any review by the Initial Purchasers of the Bank, the Seller, the Transferor, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Initial Purchasers and shall not be on behalf of any of the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor.

Indemnification.
(a) Each of the Bank, the Seller and the Transferor, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and the respective officers, directors and employees of each such person, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Initial Purchaser or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Circular (it being understood that such indemnification with respect to the Preliminary Offering Circular does not include the omission of information regarding the final amount of the Offered Notes (as reflected in the Final Offering Circular) or pricing and price-dependent information, which information shall of necessity appear only in the Final Offering Circular), the Other Materials, the Final Offering Circular or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Initial Purchaser and each such officer, director, employee or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser and each such officer, director, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that none of the Bank, the Seller nor the Transferor will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with the Initial Purchasers Information. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor may otherwise have.
provided, however,
(b) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Bank, the Seller and the Transferor, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and the respective officers, directors and employees of each such person against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Bank , the Seller or the Transferor or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Other Materials or the Final Offering Circular or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the
 
extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Other Materials or the Final Offering Circular in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor by such Initial Purchaser expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel reasonably incurred by the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor in any action or proceeding between the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor and such Initial Purchaser or between the Bank, the Seller or the Transferor and any third party or otherwise) or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that such Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission and/or delay so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party hereunder to the extent such omission and/or delay did not cause actual material prejudice to the indemnifying party and in any event shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notified the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel, if any, retained by the indemnified party pursuant to the following sentence. If (i) the defendants in any action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (ii) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel (based upon such counsel's determination) with a conflict of interest, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the institution of such action, or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party in writing to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to appoint separate counsel (at the expense of the indemnifying party) to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties; that in no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than
provided, however,
 
one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in connection with any one action or separate but similar related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment in, any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) does not include a statement as to fault, culpability or a failure to act by such indemnified party and (ii) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its consent.
(d) If recovery is not available to an indemnified party under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section for any reason other than as specified therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provisions incurred by such indemnified party (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Bank, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Offered Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Bank on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Bank on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the sale of the Offered Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Bank and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Notes. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Bank and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total purchase price of the Offered Notes purchased by such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to the amount of Offered Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, and not joint.
 
11.  If any Class A Initial Purchaser or Class A Initial Purchasers purchasing Class A Notes, or any Class B Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchasers purchasing Class B Notes, default in their obligations to purchase such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, under this Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed, but failed, to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, as applicable, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the purchase of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, by other persons, including any of the Initial Purchasers, but if no such arrangements are made within a period of 36 hours after the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Class A Initial Purchasers or Class B Initial Purchasers, as applicable, shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective total commitments under this Agreement, to purchase such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, which such defaulting Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Class A Initial Purchaser or Class A Initial Purchasers, or any Class B Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchasers, so default and the aggregate principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than 10% of the total principal amount of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Bank for the purchase of such Class A Notes or Class B Notes, as applicable, by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Class A Initial Purchasers or Class B Initial Purchasers, as applicable, or the Bank, except as provided in Section 13. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes any person substituted for a Class A Initial Purchaser or Class B Initial Purchaser, as applicable, under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability for its default.
Default of Initial Purchasers.
12.  The obligation of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Offered Notes on the Closing Date shall be terminable by such Initial Purchasers by written notice delivered to the Bank if at any time on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, or there shall have been any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York or Arizona shall have been declared by any of Federal, New York or Arizona authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, impracticable to market the Offered Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Offering Circular or (iv) any change or any development involving a prospective change occurs, materially and adversely affecting (A) the Collateral taken as a whole or (B) the business or properties of the Bank, the Transferor or the Issuer, which, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, in the case of either (A) or (B), makes it impracticable to market the Offered Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Offering Circular.
Termination of the Obligations of the Initial Purchasers.
 
13.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements by the Bank or its officers and of the several Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, the Bank or any of their respective officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive the issuance of and payment for any Offered Notes.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 or Section 12 or if for any reason the purchase of any Offered Notes by the Initial Purchasers is not consummated, the Bank shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 8(g), and the obligations of the Bank and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 10 shall remain in effect.
