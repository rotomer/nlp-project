EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom April 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated May 10, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- May 10, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR APRIL INCREASE 3.1 PERCENT SEATTLE - May 10, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $604.0 million for the four-week period ending May 5, 2007, an increase of 3.3 percent compared to sales of $584.9 million for the four-week period ending April 29, 2006. Same-store sales increased 3.1 percent. Preliminary first quarter sales of $1.95 billion increased 9.3 percent compared to sales of $1.79 billion during the same period in fiscal 2006. First quarter same-store sales increased 9.5 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 created a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007. The month of April in fiscal 2007 began and ended one week later than in fiscal 2006. This timing shift negatively impacted sales results for April 2007, but positively impacted results for the first quarter of 2007. For the period of March and April 2007 combined, same-store sales increased 9.6 percent. Combining March and April sales takes into account the shift of the Easter holiday selling period from April into March, and provides a more comparable view of results this year versus last year. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded April sales message, please dial (402) 220-6036. This recording will be available for one week. (1) Same-store sales results exclude the impact of the January 2007 closure of the Crossroads Plaza Mall full-line store in Salt Lake City, Utah, in preparation for its planned relocation in 2011. Total sales results include the impact of this store closure. 2007 ANNUAL SALES OUTLOOK Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2007, the timing shift caused by the 53rd week in fiscal 2006 is anticipated to impact the cadence of monthly same- store sales results because normal sales trends, events and holiday periods are aligned differently than last year. Outlined below is the company's same- store sales plan by quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2007, and the anticipated impact on each reporting period from the 53rd week timing shift: Period Same-store sales plan FY2006 53rd week timing shift impact 2nd Quarter 2007 1 to 2 percent Negative 3rd Quarter 2007 4 to 5 percent Positive 4th Quarter 2007 2 to 3 percent Negative 2007 Fiscal Year 3 to 4 percent Not material Historically, the second and fourth quarters are larger sales volume periods than the first and third quarters of the year.
2007 SECOND QUARTER SALES OUTLOOK The timing shift from the fiscal 2006 53rd week is expected to have a negative impact on second quarter 2007 sales results. In addition, the company's Anniversary sale event will take place one week later than in the previous year. As a result, the second quarter will have an extra non-event week between the company's Half Yearly clearance sales events and its Anniversary sale event versus last year. The months of May and June are anticipated to be negatively impacted by the timing shift of the fiscal 2006 53rd week. When compared to the planned same-store sales rate of one to two percent for the 2007 second quarter, the monthly same-store sales rate in May is expected be in-line, in June is expected to be below, and in July is expected to be above the anticipated quarterly rate.
