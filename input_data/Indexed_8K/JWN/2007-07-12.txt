Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- July 12, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR JUNE INCREASE 2.0 PERCENT SEATTLE - June 12, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $851.1 million for the five-week period ending July 7, 2007, an increase of 2.9 percent compared to sales of $827.0 million for the five-week period ending July 1, 2006. Same-store sales increased 2.0 percent. Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.49 billion increased 4.3 percent compared to sales of $1.43 billion during the same period in 2006. Quarter- to-date same-store sales increased 3.8 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $3.44 billion increased 7.1 percent compared to sales of $3.22 billion during the same period in 2006. Year-to- date same-store sales increased 6.9 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 created a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007. The month of June in fiscal 2007 began one week later than in fiscal 2006. This timing shift negatively impacted reported sales for June 2007. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded June sales message, please dial (402) 220- 6036. This recording will be available for one week. (1) Same-store sales results exclude the impact of the January 2007 closure of the Crossroads Plaza Mall full-line store in Salt Lake City, Utah, in preparation for its planned relocation in 2011. Total sales results include the impact of this store closure. SECOND QUARTER 2007 SALES OUTLOOK Our updated outlook for the 2007 second quarter same-store sales rate is for an estimated two to three percent increase. This range reflects a combination of the actual rate for May and June with the planned same-store sales rates for July. For the month of July, we expect the same-store sales rate to be in line with the anticipated quarterly rate. FUTURE REPORTING DATES Nordstrom's financial release calendar for the next three months is currently planned as follows: July Sales Release Thurs., August 9, 2007 Second Quarter Earnings Thurs., August 16, 2007 August Sales Release Thurs., Sept. 6, 2007
