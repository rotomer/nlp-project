EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom July 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated August 9, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 9, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR JULY INCREASE 9.4 PERCENT SEATTLE - August 9, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $900.5 million for the four-week period ending August 4, 2007, an increase of 6.9 percent compared to sales of $842.6 million for the four-week period ending July 29, 2006. Same-store sales increased 9.4 percent. Preliminary second quarter sales of $2.39 billion increased 5.2 percent compared to sales of $2.27 billion during the same period in 2006. Second quarter same-store sales increased 5.9 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $4.34 billion increased 7.0 percent compared to sales of $4.06 billion during the same period in 2006. Year-to- date same-store sales increased 7.5 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 created a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007. The month of July in fiscal 2007 began and ended one week later than in fiscal 2006. This timing shift positively impacted sales results for the month of July and negatively impacted sales for the second quarter of 2007. SALES RECORDING To hear Nordstrom's prerecorded July sales message, please dial (402) 220- 6036. This recording will be available for one week. (1) Same-store sales results exclude the impact of the January 2007 closure of the Crossroads Plaza Mall full-line store in Salt Lake City, Utah, in preparation for its planned relocation in 2011. Total sales results include the impact of this store closure. (2) Total sales results include the impact of the sales return reserve. Same- store sales results exclude the reserve in calculations. 2007 ANNUAL SALES OUTLOOK Throughout the remainder of 2007, the timing shift caused by the 53rd week in fiscal 2006 is anticipated to impact the cadence of monthly same-store sales results because normal sales trends, events and holiday periods are aligned differently than last year. Outlined below is the company's same-store sales plan by quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2007, and the anticipated impact on each reporting period from the 53rd week timing shift:
Historically, the second and fourth quarters are larger sales volume periods than the first and third quarters of the year. 2007 THIRD QUARTER SALES OUTLOOK The timing shift from the fiscal 2006 53rd week is expected to have a positive impact on our third quarter 2007 sales results. When compared to the planned same-store sales rate of four to five percent for the 2007 third quarter, the monthly same-store sales rates in August and September are expected to be above the anticipated quarterly rate. In October, the planned same-store sales rate is expected to be below the anticipated quarterly rate.
