Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- August 16, 2007 NORDSTROM REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 71 CENTS SEATTLE - August 16, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $180.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended August 4, 2007. For the same period last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $178.8 million and $0.67, respectively. Earnings per diluted share in the second quarter increased 6.0 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Total sales in the second quarter were $2.39 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent compared to sales of $2.27 billion during the same period in fiscal 2006. Second quarter same-store sales increased 5.9 percent. The 53rd week in fiscal 2006 created a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2007, which has 52 weeks. The second quarter in fiscal 2007 began and ended one week later than fiscal 2006. With the first week in May having higher sales than the first week in August, this timing shift negatively impacted sales results for the second quarter of 2007. SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Sales growth and gross profit rate expansion resulted from continued improvement in the company's execution of its merchandising strategy. More than offsetting our enhanced sales and gross profit during the quarter were on-plan increases in operating expenses on a percent to sales basis versus the prior year. - Same-store sales increased 5.9 percent for the quarter, exceeding the company's low-single digit same-store sales plan. In July, the company's annual Anniversary sale event that brings in new fall season merchandise before the season begins posted a same-store sales increase of 7.9 percent in our full-line stores, the seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales for the event, and the highest result over that time span. Half-yearly clearance events for women's, men's and kids' merchandise in June delivered on-plan low-single-digit same-store sales results. Merchandise categories with performance above the full-line store average for the quarter were designer apparel, accessories, and men's apparel. Same-store sales results in our online store exceeded our mid-teen planned growth rate. - Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased 36 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Improved sales and merchandise margin in women's, kids' and designer apparel contributed to gross profit rate expansion. - Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent to sales increased 110 basis points versus the same period of the prior year. Fixed expenses during the second quarter generally performed as intended. Planned cross-company projects supporting our multi-channel integration effort resulted in higher expenses on a percent to sales basis than our more typical historical rates. In our credit business, provisions for bad debt increased approximately $22 million versus last year. Approximately $14 million of the bad debt reserve is non-comparable due to the new accounting treatment for co- branded Visa receivables. The remaining $8 million of the incremental provision resulted from growth in both the Visa and proprietary card receivables ahead of plan, and from changes to assumed repayment rates versus last year. - In other income, the company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million for the disposal of an asset, which had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share of $0.01.
EXPANSION UPDATE In the third quarter of 2007, Nordstrom plans to open three new full-line stores: - On September 7, 2007, a 144,000-square-foot store at the Natick Collection in Natick, Mass.; - On September 28, 2007, a 165,000-square-foot store at the Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Mich.; - On October 19, 2007, a 138,000-square foot-store in the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver, Colo. SHARE REPURCHASE Nordstrom repurchased approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter for $590 million. This reduction in weighted- average shares outstanding had a $0.01 positive impact on earnings per diluted share for the quarter. 2007 OUTLOOK For the fiscal year ending February 2, 2008, the company anticipates earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.91 to $2.97, increased from the previous range of $2.81 to $2.90. Our outlook includes consideration for the effects of the timing shift in the 2007 4-5-4 calendar, the company's securitization transaction backed by the co-branded Visa and private label receivables, share repurchases, and other non-comparable items. Outlined in the table below are the anticipated relative effects on earnings per diluted share from non-comparable operating items expected for the remaining quarters of the 2007 fiscal year. (1) Notes on the $850 million securitization transaction: - With the completion of the securitization transaction, the company began a new accounting treatment for the co-branded Visa receivables and securitized debt, which is secured by both the co-branded Visa and private label receivables. In the first quarter, pre-existing co-branded Visa receivables totaling $943 million were recorded on the balance sheet initially at fair value with no allowance for credit losses. Normal write-offs for uncollectible Visa receivables and other costs net, estimated at $20 million, will be recorded in Other Income and Expenses over the eight month period following the transaction. This period is equal to the average repayment life of the acquired receivables. This expense activity is expected to reduce annual earnings per diluted share by $0.05 and will be non-recurring in future periods beyond the 2007 fiscal year. - Income and expenses from our co-branded Visa receivables that were previously reported net in Other Income and Expenses (under securitization accounting guidance) are reclassified in our earnings statement. In fiscal 2007, bad debt and write-off expense is expected to increase approximately $25 to $35 million and impact the SG&A rate by 30 to 40 basis points, with an accelerated portion in the second quarter. Interest expense, partially offset by interest income, will increase approximately $20 to $25 million. Other income including finance charges will increase $35 to $45 million. The net combination of these expenses and income is anticipated to reduce annual earnings per diluted share by $0.01. (2) Notes on the pending sale of Faconnable: - Upon the sale of the Faconnable business, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007, the company anticipates realizing a gain on the sale. The anticipated impact to reported earnings per diluted share is $0.08 to $0.10, and is not included in our operating outlook for the third quarter and total year. The gain on the sale of Faconnable will be treated as a non- operating event. THIRD QUARTER 2007 OUTLOOK The timing shift from the fiscal 2006 53rd week is expected to have a positive impact on third quarter 2007 sales results. When compared to the planned same-store sales rate of four to five percent for the 2007 third quarter, the monthly same-store sales rates in August and September are expected be above the anticipated quarterly rate. In October, the planned same-store sales rate is expected to be below the anticipated quarterly rate. For the third quarter of 2007, earnings per diluted share are expected in the range of $0.61 to $0.64, including a $0.01 positive impact from the non- comparable items described in the performance table earlier and excluding the anticipated gain on the sale of Faconnable.
