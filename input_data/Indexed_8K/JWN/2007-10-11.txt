EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom September 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated October 11, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release October 11, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR SEPTEMBER INCREASE 3.2 PERCENT AND COMPANY REVISES OUTLOOK SEATTLE - October 11, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $762.2 million for the five-week period ending October 6, 2007, an increase of 4.1 percent compared to sales of $732.5 million for the five-week period ending September 30, 2006. Same-store sales increased 3.2 percent. Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.34 billion increased 7.6 percent compared to sales of $1.25 billion during the same period in 2006. Quarter-to-date same-store sales increased 4.6 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $5.69 billion increased 7.2 percent compared to sales of $5.31 billion during the same period in 2006. Year-to- date same-store sales increased 6.8 percent. UPDATED THIRD QUARTER OUTLOOK "We are pleased to report positive same store sales during a month that appeared to be challenging for our industry. While we did experience positive same store sales growth, we did not achieve our plan. In addition, we entered the quarter with inventory levels above our plan and our below- plan sales performance put additional pressure on inventory levels. We are taking immediate action to bring inventory levels in line, which will negatively impact merchandise margins for the remainder of the year," commented Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, Inc. The company's below plan sales performance combined with its higher inventory position will lower expected earnings. As a result, the company now expects to deliver third quarter earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.53, which is below its prior outlook of $0.61 to $0.64. Additionally, third quarter same-store sales are now expected to increase two to four percent, below the four to five percent range announced at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with its normal practice, the company will update fourth quarter and full year guidance on November 19 upon releasing third quarter earnings. "We remain committed to our long-term strategy and feel we are in a strong competitive and financial position," continued Nordstrom. "We believe that we can continue to gain market share by offering the best fashion available, increasing our presence where our customers shop and improving the shopping experience our customers have with us. Regardless of whether our customers choose to shop with us online or in stores, we are working to make their experience with Nordstrom a more convenient and seamless one. Our current schedule of new store openings presents opportunities to reach many new customers in great retail destinations and desirable markets, some of which are brand new for our company. The initial results from our newest full-line stores in Natick, Mass., and Novi, Mich., and our new Nordstrom Rack in Tukwila, Wash., which all opened in September, are particularly encouraging. While it's early, these stores have generated a great response from customers and experienced strong results, beating our preliminary expectations."

SEPTEMBER SALES RESULTS (1)Total sales results include the impact of the sales return reserve and sales from our international Faconnable boutiques through August 31, 2007.
