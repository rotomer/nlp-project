Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release December 6, 2007 NORDSTROM SAME-STORE SALES FOR NOVEMBER INCREASE 8.7 PERCENT SEATTLE - December 6, 2007 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $804.9 million for the four-week period ending December 1, 2007, an increase of 7.4 percent compared to sales of $749.4 million for the four-week period ending November 25, 2006. Same-store sales increased 8.7 percent. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $7.12 billion increased 6.6 percent compared to sales of $6.68 billion during the same period in 2006. Year-to- date same-store sales increased 6.1 percent. The monthly same-store sales rate in November was positively impacted by the timing shift of having a 53rd week in fiscal 2006. As a result, a week of holiday shopping shifted from December to November results. Going forward, December same-store sales results are expected to be negatively impacted by this shift.
