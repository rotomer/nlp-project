EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NUMBER DESCRIPTION 99.1 Nordstrom December 2007 Preliminary Sales Release, dated January 10, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release January 10, 2008 NORDSTROM REPORTS DECEMBER 2007 SALES SEATTLE - January 10, 2008 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $1,222.9 million for the five-week period ending January 5, 2008, a decrease of 3.8 percent compared to sales of $1,271.3 million for the five-week period ending December 30, 2006. Same-store sales decreased 4.0 percent. Due to the calendar shift in the 2007 retail 4-5-4 calendar, a week of holiday shopping shifted from December to November results, which negatively impacted December results. Our preliminary quarter-to-date same-store sales, which combine November and December results, increased 0.7 percent. Quarter- to-date total sales increased 0.3 percent, from $2.02 billion in 2006 to $2.03 billion in 2007. Preliminary year-to-date sales of $8.34 billion increased 4.9 percent compared to sales of $7.95 billion during the comparable period in 2006. Year-to-date same-store sales increased 4.5 percent.
