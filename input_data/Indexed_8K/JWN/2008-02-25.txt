Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- February 25, 2008 NORDSTROM REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS SEATTLE - February 25, 2008 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $212 million, or $0.92 per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended February 2, 2008. For the fourth quarter last year, net earnings and earnings per diluted share were $232 million and $0.89, respectively. Total sales in the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 4.4 percent compared to sales of $2.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2006. Fourth quarter same-store sales decreased 0.7 percent. Similar to many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (the 53rd week) compared to the normal operating calendar of 52 weeks. Excluding the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of 2006, total sales were approximately flat in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS The fourth quarter presented a challenging consumer and retail environment, but the company continued to make good progress aligning inventory and expenses to sales trends. The company continues to focus on profitably growing market share by providing customers with a compelling selection of designer, luxury, and quality fashion merchandise. As always, Nordstrom is dedicated to offering friendly, knowledgeable, welcoming service, with a consistent offering and experience across its retail stores and online channel at Nordstrom.com. -Same-store sales decreased 0.7 percent for the quarter compared to the company's approximately flat same-store sales plan. Merchandise categories with performance above the same-store average for the quarter were designer products across categories, accessories, and women's shoes. -Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased 66 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margins declined over prior year as the company continued to align inventory with sales trends. Year end inventory per square foot was $47, down from $49 in the prior year. The decline in merchandise margin rate was partially offset by lower performance based buying costs. -Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent to sales, improved 68 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter primarily due to lower incentive costs tied to company performance, partially offset by increased bad debt expense related to our credit card business. -In the fourth quarter of 2007, Nordstrom repurchased 11 million shares totaling $388 million, with an average price of $34.38. The company had $1.4 billion remaining on its existing authorization. Fourth quarter share repurchases had a $0.01 impact on fourth quarter earnings per diluted share. The cumulative impact year to date of the company's share repurchase program added $0.06 to fourth quarter 2007 earnings per diluted share. FULL YEAR RESULTS For the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, net earnings increased 5.5 percent to $715 million compared to net earnings of $678 million last year. Earnings per diluted share for the same periods were $2.88 and $2.55, respectively. Full year results include a gain of $20.9 million, net of tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the sale of the Faconnable business, which closed during the third quarter.
Total sales for the year increased 3.1 percent to $8.8 billion compared to prior year sales of $8.6 billion. As noted previously, fiscal 2006 included a 53rd week of sales totaling $117.7 million. Excluding the extra week of sales in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 4.6 percent in fiscal year 2007. For the year, same-store sales increased 3.9 percent. As noted previously, same-store sales calculations do not include the 53rd week.
