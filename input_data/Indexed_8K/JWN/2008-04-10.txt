For Immediate Release

SEATTLE  April 10, 2008
     Preliminary quarter-to-date sales of $1.28 billion decreased 5.3 percent compared to sales of $1.35 billion in 2007. Quarter-to-date same-store sales decreased 7.8 percent.
     The monthly same-store sales results in March were negatively impacted by the timing shift of the Easter holiday from April into March as all stores were closed on Easter. Going forward, April same-store sales results are expected to be positively impacted by this shift.
