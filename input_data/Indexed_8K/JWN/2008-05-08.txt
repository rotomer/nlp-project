On May 8, 2008, Nordstrom, Inc. issued a press release announcing its preliminary April 2008 sales.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
May 8, 2008
For Immediate Release
      Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $600 million for the four-week period ended May 3, 2008, a decrease of 0.6 percent compared to sales of $604 million for the four-week period ended May 5, 2007. Same-store sales decreased 3.8 percent.
SEATTLE  May 8, 2008
     Preliminary first quarter sales of $1.88 billion decreased 3.8 percent compared to sales of $1.95 billion for the same period in 2007. First quarter same-store sales decreased 6.5 percent.
     The monthly same-store sales results in April 2008 were positively impacted by the timing shift of the Easter holiday from April to March. The company's stores were open an additional day in April 2008 when compared to April 2007.
     Nordstrom will begin its Half-Yearly Sale for Women and Kids on Wednesday, May 21, 2008, to better align with the Memorial Day Holiday shopping period, rather than Nordstrom's traditional early June start of the semi-annual sale event. Accordingly, we expect sales results for May to be positively impacted and June to be negatively impacted by this timing shift.
