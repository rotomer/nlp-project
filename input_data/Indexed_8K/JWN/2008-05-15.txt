Exhibit 99.1 For release: Thurs., May 15, 2008 at 1:05 p.m. PT - ------------------------------------------------- NORDSTROM REPORTS 2008 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 54 CENTS SEATTLE - May 15, 2008 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $119 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended May 3, 2008. For the same quarter last year, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $157 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.60. Total sales in the first quarter were $1.88 billion, a decrease of 3.8 percent compared to sales of $1.95 billion during the same period in fiscal 2007. First quarter same-store sales decreased 6.5 percent. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS The company's focus on expense management and continued inventory control enabled it to achieve the high end of its earnings per share plan, despite the challenging retail environment. Earnings per diluted share decreased 10 percent compared to the same quarter last year. -Same-store sales decreased 6.5 percent for the quarter, below the company's planned 3 to 5 percent same-store sales decline. Merchandise categories with performance above the same-store average for the quarter were cosmetics, designer products across all categories, and women's activewear and intimate apparel. -Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased 57 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Merchandise margins declined over prior year as the company utilized markdowns to align inventory with sales trends. Quarter- end inventory per square foot was down 7 percent from the prior year. Three percent of the decline was due to the sale of the company's Faconnable business in the third quarter of 2007. The decline in merchandise margin rate was partially offset by lower buying and occupancy costs. -Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent, or $11 million, compared to last year's first quarter. Retail square footage grew by 5 percent over last year due to the opening of seven full-line stores and one Rack store since May 2007. The company's focus on controlling expenses offset the costs associated with these new stores and increased bad debt expense. -In the first quarter of 2008, Nordstrom repurchased 4.6 million shares totaling $162 million, with an average price of $35.56. The company had $1.2 billion remaining on its existing authorization. First quarter share repurchases had a $0.01 impact on first quarter earnings per diluted share. EXPANSION UPDATE During the first quarter, Nordstrom opened four full-line stores: -On February 15, 2008, a 172,000-square-foot store at Aventura Mall in Aventura, Fla.; -On March 7, 2008, a 211,000-square-foot store at the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Hawaii; -On March 28, 2008, a 143,000-square foot-store at the Burlington Mall in Burlington, Mass.; -On April 18, 2008, a 122,000-square-foot-store at The Mall at Partridge Creek in Clinton Township, Michigan. FISCAL YEAR 2008 OUTLOOK Based on current business trends, the company has taken a more cautious approach to planning the remainder of 2008. The company is reducing operating expenses to mitigate the impact of lower sales expectations on earnings. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009, the company anticipates earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.65 to $2.80, decreased from the previous
range of $2.75 to $2.90. The company's revised expectations for fiscal year 2008 are as follows: Fiscal 2008 ----------- Same-store Sales 4% to 6% decrease Gross Profit (%) 60 to 90 basis point decrease Selling, General and Admin. Expense (%) 25 to 60 basis point increase Interest Expense, net $55 to $60 million increase Finance Charges and Other, net $30 to $40 million increase Effective Tax Rate 39.0% Earnings per Diluted Share $2.65 to $2.80 Diluted Shares Outstanding 222 million SECOND QUARTER 2008 OUTLOOK For the second quarter of 2008, earnings per diluted share are expected in the range of $0.65 to $0.70, based on a same-store sales plan of -5 percent to -7 percent. Due to an earlier start date of our Half-Yearly Sale for Women and Kids, the company expects May same-store sales to be 1500 - 1700 basis points above the quarterly plan and June same-store sales are expected to be 1300 - 1500 basis points below the quarterly plan. The earlier start date does not impact the quarterly same-store sales expectations and July sales should be consistent with the second quarter rate.
