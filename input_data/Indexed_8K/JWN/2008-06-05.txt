EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
     -Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $716 million for the four-week period ended May 31, 2008, an increase of 12.2 percent compared to sales of $638 million for the four-week period ended June 2, 2007. Same-store sales increased 10.9 percent which was positively impacted by the earlier start date of the Half-Yearly Sale for Women and Kids.
SEATTLE (June 5, 2008)
     The company expected May same-store sales to be 8 to 12 percent, or 1500 to 1700 basis points above the quarterly plan of -5 to -7 percent. June same-store sales are expected to be -18 to -22 percent, or 1300 to 1500 basis points below the quarterly plan. Combining the results of May and June will provide a more comparable view of the company's results versus last year. July sales are anticipated to be consistent with the second quarter plan.
     Preliminary year-to-date sales of $2.59 billion were approximately flat compared to sales for the same period in 2007. Year-to-date same-store sales decreased 2.2 percent.
