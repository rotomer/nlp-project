Exhibit 99.1 NORDSTROM For release: February 23, 2009 at 1:05 p.m. PT - -------------------------------------------- NORDSTROM REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2008 EARNINGS SEATTLE, Wash. - February 23, 2009 - Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported net earnings of $68 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2009. For the same quarter last year, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $212 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. Total sales in the fourth quarter were $2.30 billion, a decrease of 8.5 percent compared with sales of $2.51 billion during the same period in fiscal 2007. Fourth quarter same-store sales decreased 12.5 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2007. FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY Although the retail operating environment was difficult, Nordstrom continued to align the key drivers of its business to the current economic realities. The company made good progress adjusting inventory levels to current sales trends, reducing expenses without compromising its commitment to the customer and lowering capital expenditures. Fourth quarter sales were slightly better than original expectations and earnings per share were in-line with consensus expectations of $0.30. -Results in full-line stores continued to be challenging, as same-store sales decreased 15.8 percent. -Nordstrom Rack was one of the top performers amongst its off-price competitors with a same-store sales decrease of 1.5 percent. -Sales for Nordstrom Direct continued to be strong, increasing 9.7 percent. -Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 561 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter, due to significantly higher levels of markdowns. Nordstrom's merchant and store teams responded well to the intense competitive environment, preserving the company's market share. Year- end inventory per square foot was down 12 percent from the prior year, which is in-line with the fourth quarter same-store sales decrease of 12.5 percent. -Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $25 million, excluding additional expenses of $58 million from higher reserves for bad debt and new stores. The company opened 8 new full-line stores and 6 new Nordstrom Rack stores since the fourth quarter of 2007, increasing retail square footage by 1.4 million or 6.7 percent. FULL YEAR RESULTS For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, net earnings were $401 million compared with net earnings of $715 million last year. Earnings per diluted share for the same periods were $1.83 and $2.88, respectively. Fiscal 2007 full year results include a gain of $20.9 million, net of tax, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the sale of the Faconnable business during the third quarter of 2007. Total sales for the year decreased 6.3 percent to $8.3 billion compared with prior year sales of $8.8 billion. Full year same-store sales decreased 9.0 percent.
EXPANSION UPDATE In 2009, Nordstrom plans to open three new full-line stores and relocate one full-line store: -On March 6, a relocated full-line store at Fashion Place in Murray, Utah that replaces a store built in 1981 -On March 27, a new store at the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey -On April 17, the company's third Boston-area store at the Northshore Mall in Peabody, Massachusetts -On September 25, a new store at Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, Ohio In spring 2009, Nordstrom plans to open five new Nordstrom Rack stores: -Park Lane in Dallas, Texas -Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey -The Commons at Southtowne in Sandy, Utah -Orland Park Place in Orland Park, Illinois -Ravenswood 101 in East Palo Alto, California In fall 2009, Nordstrom plans to open five new Nordstrom Rack stores: -Beverly Connection in Los Angeles, California -Shops of Southlake in Southlake, Texas -Millenia Crossing in Orlando, Florida -Hastings Village in Pasadena, California -Rookwood Pavilion in Cincinnati, Ohio FISCAL YEAR 2009 OUTLOOK Nordstrom is planning for 2009 based on the trends the company experienced in the second-half of 2008. The company will continue to align the key drivers of its business (inventory, expenses, working capital and capital expenditures) to mitigate operating margin pressure, enhance free cash flow and maintain a healthy balance sheet. For the 2009 fiscal year, Nordstrom expects same-store sales to decrease 10 to 15 percent, which yields earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 for the full year. Outlined in the table below are the company's expectations for fiscal year 2009: Same-store Sales 10% to 15% decrease Gross Profit (%) 150 to 250 basis point decrease Selling, General and Admin. Expense ($) $100 to $175 million decrease Selling, General and Admin. Expense (%) 40 to 70 basis point increase Finance Charges and Other, net $55 to $60 million increase Interest Expense, net $20 to $25 million increase Effective Tax Rate 39.4% to 39.7% Earnings per Diluted Share $1.10 to $1.40 Diluted Shares Outstanding 219 million It has always been Nordstrom's practice to clearly and openly communicate with its shareholders and other constituencies. In this spirit, the company will continue to provide its expectations for annual results, which it will update with each quarterly earnings release. As the economy has weakened and become more unpredictable, it has become difficult to accurately predict near- term results. Given the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, Nordstrom does not feel it is appropriate to continue providing quarterly EPS estimates. Nordstrom believes that providing its annual expectations in line- item detail, combined with the continued release of monthly sales, will allow interested parties to effectively monitor and assess the company's performance. The company expects same-store sales in the first half of 2009 to be 300 to 400 basis points below the outlook for the fiscal year.
