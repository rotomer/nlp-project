EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
      Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported preliminary sales of $561 million for the four-week period ended May 2, 2009, a decrease of 6.5 percent compared with sales of $600 million for the four-week period ended May 3, 2008. Same-store sales for April decreased 10.8 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2008. April sales were favorably affected by the timing shift of the Easter holiday from March into April, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of the timing shift of a Nordstrom Rewards event for Nordstrom cardholders. In fiscal 2008, the event began in late April whereas in fiscal 2009 the event occurred in March.
SEATTLE, Wash. (May 7, 2009)
