On February 23, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the following actions relative to salary and performance-based bonus awards for the Company's Named Executive Officers as set forth in the Company's proxy statement dated April 8, 2010 (the "NEOs"):
 
 
 
The Committee also awarded stock option grants to the Company's five NEOs, effective February 25, 2011. Stock options were granted pursuant to the terms of the Nordstrom, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Stock option grants have a term of ten years with an exercise price equivalent to the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on February 25, 2011. Vesting occurs at a rate of 25% annually beginning one year from the date of grant. The number of options to be awarded to each individual is a function of base pay, a long-term incentive (LTI) percentage and the fair value of an option. The Binomial Lattice model is used to estimate the fair value of an option. This model requires the input of certain assumptions, including risk-free interest rate, volatility, dividend yield and expected life. The formula for determining the number of options granted is:
The form of the 2011 Nonqualified Stock Option Grant Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 26, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference. The number of options actually granted to each of the NEOs, once determined, will be reported in an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
On February 23, 2011, the Committee also awarded Performance Share Units ("PSUs") to the Company's five NEOs pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Participants may elect to settle PSUs in shares of Company Common Stock or cash upon the achievement of such performance goals as may be established by the Committee at the time of grant based on any one or a combination of certain performance criteria enumerated in the Plan. The 2011 PSUs are earned over a three-year period from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2013. The percentage of PSUs granted that will actually be earned at the end of the three-year period is based upon the Company's total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of companies in a pre-defined group of retail peers during that same period. Total shareholder return is based on a 30 trading-day closing price average that is established both prior to the beginning of the performance cycle and prior to the end of the performance cycle. PSUs will only be earned if the Company's total shareholder return for the period is positive. The number of PSUs awarded to each individual was a function of base pay, a long-term incentive (LTI) percentage and stock price. The formula for determining the number of PSUs granted is:
 
The form of the 2011 Performance Share Unit Award Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 16, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference. The number of PSUs awarded to the NEOs is shown in the table below.
 
Also on February 23, 2011, the Committee certified the level of attainment of the pre-established performance goals for the 2008 PSU grant relating to fiscal years 2008 through 2010 at 85%. The PSUs for the NEOs were all paid in cash. The number of PSUs vested and the corresponding cash payment to settle the PSUs for each of the NEOs was as follows:
 
The Committee also established bonus goals, performance levels and award levels that may be earned during the fiscal year ending January 28, 2012 ("Fiscal Year 2011") under the Bonus Plan. Under the Bonus Plan, bonus awards are paid only when performance goals are achieved. The bonus target and maximum payments are expressed as a percentage of base salary and the bonus goals are consistent across roles.
Fiscal Year 2011 bonus arrangements for the Company's NEOs were established by the Committee as follows (Earnings before Interest and Taxes is referred to in the table below as "EBIT" and Return on Invested Capital is referred to as "ROIC"):
