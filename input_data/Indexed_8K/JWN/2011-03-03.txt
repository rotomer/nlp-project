 Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported a 7.3 percent increase in same-store sales for the four-week period ended February 26, 2011 compared with the four-week period ended February 27, 2010. Preliminary total retail sales of $606 million for February 2011 increased 12.3 percent compared with total retail sales of $539 million for the same period in fiscal 2010.
SEATTLE, Wash. (March 3, 2011)
Effective with February 2011, the company will report same-store sales for the total company, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. "Nordstrom" (formerly referred to as "Multi-channel") includes Nordstrom full-line stores and Direct. The consolidation of full-line and Direct sales reflects the company's recognition that the customer does not differentiate between the two channels, and is consistent with how the company plans and manages the business.
