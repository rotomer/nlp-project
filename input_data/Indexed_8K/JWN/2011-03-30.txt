ITEM 8.01 Other Events On March 29, 2011, Michael G. Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Nordstrom, Inc. adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under Rule 10b5-1, directors, officers and other employees who are not in possession of material non-public information may adopt a pre-arranged plan or contract for the sale of Company securities under specified conditions and at specified times. Using these 10b5-1 plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios, spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and avoid concerns about transactions occurring at a time when they might possess material non-public information. Michael Koppel's 10b5-1 plan provides for the sale of up to 57,670 shares to be acquired through the exercise of stock options which are scheduled to expire in February 2012. Shares may be sold under Michael Koppel's plan on the open market at prevailing market prices and subject to minimum price thresholds specified in his plan. Transactions under the 10b5-1 plan will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Nordstrom does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plan, except to the extent required by law.
