Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends Item 5.02 of the Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 17, 2012, filed by Nordstrom, Inc. (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2012, relating to compensatory arrangements of the Company's five Named Executive Officers (the "NEOs") as set forth in the Company's proxy statement dated March 31, 2011. As referenced in the original filing, the number of stock options to be awarded to the NEOs was to be determined pursuant to an established formula, but at the time of the filing of the Current Report on Form 8-K not all inputs for that formula were available. For that reason, the number of stock options actually awarded was indeterminable. This amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed to update the prior filing and provide this information.
As previously reported in the Form 8-K, on February 17, 2012 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company awarded stock option grants, effective February 22, 2012, to the Company's five NEOs. The exercise price of these options was $52.63, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on February 22, 2012. The number of stock options awarded to each of the NEOs is provided in the table below.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
