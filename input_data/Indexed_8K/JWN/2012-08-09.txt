EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported its results for the second quarter, which reflected a shift in timing of the Anniversary Sale event with one week of the event moving into the fiscal third quarter. Net earnings were $156 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended July 28, 2012, compared with net earnings of $175 million, $0.80 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year.
SEATTLE, Wash. (August 9, 2012) 
The Anniversary Sale is historically the Company's largest sale of the year and started one week later in July relative to last year. The Company expected the event shift to cause an unfavorable comparison in the second quarter, offset by a favorable impact in the third quarter. Second quarter sales and Anniversary Sale results through the end of July exceeded Company expectations. Second quarter same-store sales increased 4.5 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2011. Net sales in the second quarter were $2.92 billion, an increase of 7.4 percent compared with net sales of $2.72 billion during the same period in fiscal 2011.

We use various financial measures in our conference calls, investor meetings and other forums which may be considered non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The following disclosure provides additional information regarding our Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for the 12 fiscal months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011:
We believe that ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared with return on assets (net earnings divided by average total assets), it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. ROIC is one of our key financial metrics, and we also incorporate it into our executive incentive measures. We believe that overall performance as measured by ROIC correlates directly to shareholders' return over the long term. For the 12 fiscal months ended July 28, 2012, our ROIC decreased to 12.7% compared with 13.8% for the 12 fiscal months ended July 30, 2011. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, should not be considered a substitute for return on assets, net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The closest measure calculated using GAAP amounts is return on assets, which decreased to 8.1% from 9.0% for the 12 fiscal months ended July 28, 2012, compared with the 12 fiscal months ended July 30, 2011. The following is a comparison of return on assets to ROIC:
 
1
Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease, or we purchased the property. Asset base is calculated as described in footnote 5 below.
2
Based upon our effective tax rate multiplied by the net operating profit for the 12 fiscal months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011.
3
Based upon the trailing 12-month average.
4
Based upon the trailing 12-month average for accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, and other current liabilities.
5
Based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base, which is calculated as the trailing 12-months rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases described in footnote 1.
We use various financial measures in our conference calls, investor meetings and other forums which may be considered non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G of the SEC. The following disclosure provides additional information regarding our Adjusted Debt to Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (EBITDAR) as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011:
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our current goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating as well as operate with an efficient capital structure for our size, growth plans and industry. Investment-grade credit ratings are important to maintaining access to a variety of short-term and long-term sources of funding, and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business. We believe a higher ratio, among other factors, could result in rating agency downgrades. In contrast, we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns. As of July 28, 2012, our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR was 2.2 compared with 2.0 as of July 30, 2011.
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings, net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR does have limitations:
 
 
 
To compensate for these limitations, we analyze Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR in conjunction with other GAAP financial and performance measures impacting liquidity, including operating cash flows, capital spending and net earnings. The closest measure calculated using GAAP amounts is debt to net earnings, which was 4.7 for the second quarter of 2012 and 4.2 for the second quarter of 2011. The following is a comparison of debt to net earnings and Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR:
 
1
The components of Adjusted Debt are as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, while the components of EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011.
2
The multiple of eight times rent expense used to calculate Adjusted Debt is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease, or we had purchased the property.
We use various financial measures in our conference calls, investor meetings and other forums which may be considered non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G of the SEC. The following disclosure provides additional information regarding our Free Cash Flow for the six months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011:
Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides us with a meaningful analysis of our cash flows. We believe that our ability to generate cash is more appropriately analyzed using this measure. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Free Cash Flow does have limitations:
 
 
To compensate for these limitations, we analyze Free Cash Flow in conjunction with other GAAP financial and performance measures impacting liquidity, including operating cash flows. The closest GAAP measure calculated using GAAP amounts is net cash provided by operating activities, which was $372 and $513 for the six months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011. The following is a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow:
