     (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; , that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any Preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter to the extent that the sale to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Underwriter and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such Underwriter results from the fact that both (i) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company with the provisions of Section 4 hereof.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
provided
     (b)  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information identified in this Underwriting Agreement as being provided by the Underwriters.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c)  If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly
Notice and Procedures.
 
notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have

been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d)  If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
     (e)  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
 
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
     (f)  The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
     7.     . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities or by European Union authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States or a member of the European Union of a national emergency or war or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is so material and adverse as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus.
Termination
     8.     . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed
Defaulting Underwriter
 
in this Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 8, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
     (c)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 9 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 6 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d)  Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     9.     (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the copying and distribution of the Indenture and the preparation of the certificates representing the Securities; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to either of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iv) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (v) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Underwriting Agreement and all other agreements or
Payment of Expenses
.
 
documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate (including filing fees) and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; (ix) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (x) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee, including any paying agent, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; (xi) any fees and expenses payable in connection with the initial and continued listing of the Securities on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and the fees and expenses of a Luxembourg listing and paying agent; (xii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of any offering by, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; and (xiii) all other costs and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section 9 and Section 6, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel.
     (b)  If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
     10.     . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 6 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
     11.     . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any

     Certain Terms of the Securities:
 
Annex A
     1.     The Company and each of the Significant Subsidiaries are existing and in good standing under the general corporation laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and are qualified to do business and are in good standing as foreign corporations in each jurisdiction in which their respective ownership or lease of property or the conduct of their respective businesses requires such qualification (in each case to the extent such jurisdictions recognize such concepts), except those in which the failure to be so existing or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Averse Effect, and have the corporate power necessary to own and lease their respective properties and to conduct their respective businesses as described in the Prospectus.
     2.     All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned, directly or indirectly by the Company, to my knowledge, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, except for (i) a lien on the stock of Kellogg (Deutschland) GmbH and (ii) such liens, claims and encumbrances that are immaterial to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
     3.     The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     4.     The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     5.     The Securities are in the form established pursuant to the Indenture, have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     6.     The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the sale by the Company of the Securities to you in accordance with this Underwriting Agreement) do not (i) violate the charter or by-laws of the Company, (ii) constitute a material violation by the Company of any provision of any law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body applicable to the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries or any of their properties (except that I express no opinion in this paragraph as to compliance with any disclosure requirement or any prohibition against fraud or misrepresentation) or (iii) to my actual knowledge, conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
 
under, or result in the creation or imposition of a lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company or any Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is bound or to which any property or assets of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is subject, except for in the cases of items (ii) and (iii) any such violation, breach or default which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.
     7.     The Company was not required to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or order of, or make any registration, filing or qualification with, any court or governmental agency or body for the issuance, delivery and sale of the Securities under the Transaction Documents or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the Indenture or the Underwriting Agreement, except such as may be required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the security or blue sky laws of the various states (and the rules and regulations thereunder) or of any jurisdiction outside the United States, as to which I express no opinion in this paragraph.
     8.     Such counsel has no knowledge of any legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is the subject which would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture; and I have no knowledge that any such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
     9.     Such counsel has no knowledge about any legal or governmental proceeding that is pending or threatened against the Company that has caused such counsel to conclude that such proceeding is required by Item 103 of Regulation S-K to be described in the Prospectus but that is not so described. Such counsel has no knowledge about any contract to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject that has caused such counsel to conclude that such contract is required to be described in the Prospectus but is not so described or is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement but has not been so filed.
     I, or members of my staff have examined various documents, as indicated above, and participated in conferences with your representatives, your counsel and representatives of the independent accountants of the Company during which disclosures in the Registration Statement were discussed. However, I am not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Prospectus or the Registration Statement and I make no representation that the actions taken in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or Prospectus
 
(including the actions described in the preceding sentence) were sufficient to cause the Registration Statement or Prospectus to be accurate, complete or fair.
     Subject to the foregoing, I can, however, advise you that nothing has come to my attention that has caused me to conclude that (i) the Registration Statement at its effective date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Prospectus at the date it bears or on the date of this letter contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, I can confirm that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial date included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion) appear on their face to be responsive as to form in all material respects to the requirements of Form S-3 and the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when filed with the Commission, appear on their face to be responsive as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act; provided, that in making the statement in this sentence, I am not expressing any opinion as to the adequacy of the disclosure contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or as to compliance with any prohibition against fraud or misrepresentation.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Gary H. Pilnick described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
 
Annex B
     1.     A member of the Commission's staff has advised us by telephone that the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, pursuant to authority delegated to it by the Commission, has entered an order declaring the Registration Statement effective under the Securities Act on November 2, 2001 (the "effective date") and we have no knowledge that any stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued or that any proceedings for that purpose are pending before, or overtly threatened by, the Commission. Section 309(a) of the Trust Indenture Act provides that the Indenture shall be deemed to have been qualified under that Act when the Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act. Any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b).
     2.     The Indenture is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability. The Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
     3.     The Securities, assuming the due execution and delivery thereof by the Company and payment therefor by the Underwriters, are valid and binding obligations of the Company, will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and are enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.
     4.     The information in the Prospectus under the heading "United States Federal Tax Considerations" to the extent that it summarizes laws, governmental rules or regulations or documents referred to therein is correct in all material respects.
     5.     The Indenture and the Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     6.     The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters and application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds" will not be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     The purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish factual matters, and preparation of the Registration Statement involved many determinations of a wholly or partially nonlegal character. We make no representation that we have independently
 
verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Prospectus or Registration Statement or that the actions taken in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or Prospectus (including the actions described in the next paragraph) were sufficient to cause the Prospectus or Registration Statement to be accurate, complete or fair. We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Prospectus or the Registration Statement except to the extent otherwise explicitly indicated in numbered paragraphs 4 and 5 above.
     We can however confirm that we have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters, counsel for the Underwriters and representatives of the independent accountants for the Company during which disclosures in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed. In addition, we have reviewed certain corporate records furnished to us by the Company. We were not retained by the Company to prepare the periodic reports, proxy statements, or other materials incorporated in the Prospectus or Registration Statement, and our knowledge about these materials is limited.
     Based upon our participation in the conferences and our document review identified in the preceding paragraph, our understanding of applicable law and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder and relying as to materiality to a large extent upon the opinions and statements of officers of the Company, we can, however, advise you that nothing has come to our attention that has caused us to conclude that (i) the Registration Statement at its effective date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Prospectus at the date it bears or on the date of this letter contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, we can confirm that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial date included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be responsive as to form in all material respects to the requirements of Form S-3; provided, that in making this statement in this sentence, we are not expressing any opinion as to the adequacy of the disclosure contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or as to compliance with any prohibition against fraud or misrepresentation.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Kirkland & Ellis described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.

 
Exhibit 4.01
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Company (as defined below) or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
     Kellogg Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum set forth above or such other principal sum on the Schedule attached hereto (which shall not exceed U.S.$500,000,000) on June 1, 2008, and to pay interest thereon from June 5, 2003 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on June 1 and December 1 in each year, commencing December 1, 2003, at the rate of 2.875% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

provided
however
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Dated: June 5, 2003
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     Section 1.
Indenture
     The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of March 15, 2001, between the Company and the Trustee, and Supplemental Indenture No. 1 thereto, dated as of March 29, 2001 (collectively, the "Indenture"). The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of such terms and provisions.
     The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company initially limited to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding. This Security is one of a Series designated as 2.875% Senior Notes due 2008 of the Company.
     Section 2.
Redemption
     All or a portion of the Securities will be redeemable at any time or from time to time at the option of the Company at a redemption price equal to the greater of
     (a)  one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed on the redemption date; and
     (b)  the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on such redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 15 basis points,
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Securities that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered Securityholders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the Securities and the Indenture. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Securityholder. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Quotation.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or its respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
     On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the securities of any series are to be redeemed, the securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
     Section 3.
Payment of Additional Amounts
     The Company shall pay to any Securityholder who is a non-United States person such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment in respect of the principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Securities, after deduction or withholding by the Company or any Paying Agent for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Securities to be then due and payable before any such deduction or withholding for or on account of any such tax, assessment or governmental charge. The foregoing obligation to pay such Additional Amounts shall not apply to:
 
     (a)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for:
     (b)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation by the Securityholder for payment on a date more than 10 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
     (c)  any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or excise tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge;
     (d)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payments in respect of principal of or interest, if any, on any of the Securities;
     (e)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on interest received by a Securityholder or beneficial owner of the Securities who actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;
     (f)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed as a result of the failure to comply with:
 
     (g)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from any payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on any of the Securities, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other Paying Agent;
     (h)  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is required to be made pursuant to any European Union directive on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any such directive; or
     (i)  any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h);
nor will such Additional Amounts be paid to any Securityholder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the Securities to the extent a settlor or beneficiary with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner of the Securities would not have been entitled to payment of such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Securityholder. The Securities are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable thereto. Except as specifically provided under this Section 3, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
     Section 4.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
     If, as a result of:
there is, in such case, in the written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to the Company, a material increase in the probability that the Company has or may become obligated to pay Additional Amounts, and the Company in its business judgment, determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not
 
including assignment of the Securities, the Securities affected thereby may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the Company's option at any time thereafter, upon notice to the Trustee and the Securityholders affected thereby in accordance with the provisions of this Security and the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed together with accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
     Section 5.
Sinking Fund
     The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund.
     Section 6.
Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
     The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000. A Securityholder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Securityholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption or to transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days prior to the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed.
     A global Security deposited with the Depositary or the Trustee shall be transferred to the beneficial owner thereof in the form of Definitive Securities only if (a) the Company notifies the Trustee in writing that the Depositary, Euroclear or Clearstream is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary or clearing system for the Securities or the Depositary ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary or clearing system is not appointed within 90 days of this notice or cessation, (b) the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Securities in definitive form under the Indenture or (c) upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Securities. Upon surrender by the Depositary of the global Securities, certificated Securities will be issued to each Person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the global Security. Upon any such issuance, the Trustee is required to register the certificated Securities in the name of the Person or Persons or the nominee of any of these Persons and cause the same to be delivered to these Persons. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the Depositary or any participant or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued.
     Section 7.

     Section 10.
Discharge and Defeasance
     Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
     Section 11.
