EXHIBIT 99.1 [KELLOGG'S LOGO] Kellogg Company News FOR RELEASE: November 3, 2003 MEDIA/ANALYST John P. Renwick, CFA (269) 961-6365 CONTACTS: Simon D. Burton, CFA (269) 961-6636 STRONG SALES BOOST KELLOGG'S EARNINGS AND OUTLOOK BATTLE CREEK, MICH. -- Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today reported that strong net sales growth drove a substantial earnings gain in the third quarter of 2003, even after significant reinvestment for future growth. This business momentum prompted the Company to raise its full-year earnings guidance. Reported net earnings were $231.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to the year-ago period's $203.5 million, or $0.49 per share. This represents earnings per share growth of 14% year-over-year. Through the first nine months, reported net earnings increased by 13% to $599.1 million, or $1.46 per share, compared to year-earlier earnings of $529.9 million, or $1.29 per share. Excluding $0.02 of favorable legal settlements in 2002's first quarter, EPS growth during the first nine months of 2003 was 15%. "Our momentum continued into the third quarter of 2003, as we posted record sales, operating income, earnings per share and cash flow," said Carlos Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer. "Importantly, we also were able to make significant investments in our brands and absorb costs related to productivity initiatives that will drive the business in 2004 and beyond." Net sales in the third quarter increased by 6.8%, to $2.28 billion. Foreign currency translation contributed 2.7 percentage points to the sales growth, and a small divestiture, completed at the beginning of 2003, reduced growth by about 0.4 percentage point. Excluding the effect of currency translation and this divestiture, Kellogg's internal sales growth was 4.5%. This internal growth rate was higher than that recorded during the first half of the year, and it compared against a notably strong year-earlier rate of 5.6%. - more -
- 2 - This sales growth was broad-based, with all major geographic areas posting solid gains. Kellogg USA's internal net sales growth exceeded 3%, as a decline in cookies sales was more than offset by gains in cereal, wholesome snacks, and other products. U.S. Retail Cereal sales increased 11%, as new products and effective advertising and consumer promotions enabled us to grow on top of a difficult comparison of 6% growth in the year-ago period. Despite growth in wholesome snacks and crackers, our U.S. Snacks business posted an internal sales decline of 4% as a result of continued weak cookie sales, the elimination of numerous products (stock-keeping units), and the discontinuation of a major custom-manufacturing account. The U.S. All Other businesses collectively posted 3% internal net sales growth in the quarter, led by Pop-Tarts toaster pastries. Kellogg International again posted excellent results with an increase in net sales of approximately 15%, or almost 7% in local currencies. This gain resulted from continued execution of the Company's Volume to Value strategy, which featured increased brand building and innovation, and drove an improvement in mix. The Company's European business posted currency-adjusted sales growth of almost 4% as the region's largest market, the U.K., again achieved strong sales growth and share gains as a result of marketing initiatives and new product introductions. Elsewhere in Europe, the Company posted notable internal growth in France, Spain, and Italy. In Latin America, the Company reported sales growth of approximately 10%, or almost 17% on a currency-neutral basis. This was led by significant internal sales growth in the Mexican business, where both the cereal and snacks segments were very strong. The other segment of Kellogg International, comprised of Australia, Canada, and Asia, collectively posted local-currency sales growth of approximately 5%. "Kellogg International and U.S. Cereal performed impressively, as they both featured strong top-line growth on top of year-ago gains, and were driven the right way -- through brand building and innovation," commented Mr. Gutierrez. "While the cookies segment of our U.S. Snacks business was soft, we were able to generate double-digit growth in wholesome snacks." Driven by the increase in sales, operating profit in the quarter grew by approximately 4%, to $431 million. Kellogg's gross profit margin decreased by a slight 20 basis points, due to asset - more -

Obscured by these costs, was the impact of operating leverage, favorable mix, and productivity savings, which more than offset the effect of higher commodity, energy, and benefits costs. The Company also continued to invest in its brands, with advertising and consumer promotion rising at a double-digit rate over the year-earlier quarter. "Key to sustaining our top- and bottom-line growth is improving our underlying profitability and reinvesting in our brands," said Mr. Gutierrez. "During the third quarter, our profitability was strong enough that we could invest significantly in brand building, absorb up-front costs related to productivity initiatives, and still post solid earnings growth." Cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditure, was $470 million in the quarter, which represented a 3% increase over the strong comparable growth of 26% posted in the third quarter of last year. Working capital efficiency improved as a percentage of rolling twelve-month sales for the ninth consecutive quarter. The Company paid down approximately $200 million of debt during the quarter. Mr. Gutierrez said, "It is cash flow that improves our financial flexibility and creates value for share owners. This quarter we posted records for cash flow and working capital as a percentage of sales. Our entire organization is focused on `managing for cash', and our better-than-expected cash flow this year is a result of our employees' great work." KELLOGG RAISES 2003 GUIDANCE AND OFFERS 2004 PREVIEW Based on its strong year-to-date results and expectations for continued momentum, Kellogg moved its full-year 2003 earnings per share guidance to $1.89-1.91, from its previous range of $1.88-1.90. The Company stated that its fourth quarter should feature mid-single-digit net sales growth and substantial reinvestment in the business, including a double-digit increase in brand building and additional up-front expenses related to cost-savings projects. Kellogg also gave preliminary indications for 2004, forecasting earnings per share of $2.05-2.09, in line with its ongoing target of high single-digit growth. The Company projects low single- - more -
- 4 - digit net sales growth, before currency translation or the benefit of an extra shipping week in the fourth quarter. Operating leverage, mix, productivity savings, and cost control should again allow the Company to overcome significantly higher benefits expense and commodity costs, while continuing to fund strong investment in brand building and absorb costs related to productivity initiatives. Mr. Gutierrez concluded, "The third quarter provided further evidence that there is good momentum in our business, and that we are reinvesting for sustained growth in 2004. We are running our Company for many years of steady, dependable growth."
