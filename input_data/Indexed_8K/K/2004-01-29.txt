Kellogg Company News For release: January 29, 2004 Analyst/Media John P. Renwick, CFA (269) 961-6365 Contacts: Simon D. Burton, CFA (269) 961-6636 KELLOGG COMPLETES STRONG 2003 BATTLE CREEK, Mich. - Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today reported that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings were at the high end of its previously increased forecast range. It also reaffirmed its comfort with the high end of its forecast range for 2004, citing its current momentum and last year's strong reinvestment in the business. Reported net earnings for the full year 2003 were $787.1 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, a 10% increase from last year's $720.9 million, or $1.75 per share. Excluding $0.02 per share from favorable legal settlements received in the first quarter of 2002, our EPS growth in 2003 was 11%. Reported net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $188.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $191.0 million or $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. This expected decline was attributable to a significant increase in brand building investment, as well as the absorption of substantial asset write-offs and up-front costs related to cost-savings initiatives. "This was an outstanding year, featuring momentum and reinvestment," said Carlos Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer. "We remained focused on our strategy and our financial model. We delivered solid sales growth in every quarter and across our portfolio. We invested for future growth by increasing advertising and promotion and absorbed costs related to several cost-savings projects. We exceeded our initial earnings forecast, and our strong cash flow was used to dramatically improve our financial flexibility. All of the above should contribute to dependable, sustainable growth in the years to come." Reported net sales in 2003 increased by 6% to $8.8 billion, with fourth quarter sales growing 8%, to $2.1 billion. Internal net sales growth, which excludes foreign-currency translation and the impact of divestitures, was 4% for both periods. Kellogg USA reported net sales growth of 2% in 2003, and 3% in the fourth quarter. On an internal basis, which excludes the impact of two small divestitures, its growth was 3% in 2003, and 4% in the fourth quarter. Retail cereal sales continued to be strong, increasing by 7% in 2003, and by 9% in the fourth quarter; this business posted its third consecutive year of increased share of the ready-to-eat cereal category. Retail snacks' internal sales were flat for the year and down 3% in the fourth quarter, as good growth in wholesome snacks was offset by the impact of continued weak cookie sales, the elimination of numerous products (stock-keeping units), and the discontinuation of a custom-manufacturing account. All other U.S. businesses collectively posted 3% internal sales growth in 2003, including a 6% gain in the fourth quarter. Kellogg International reported net sales growth of 15% in 2003, and 17% in the fourth quarter. Internal sales growth, which excludes foreign currency translation, was 5% in 2003, with fourth-quarter growth of 4%. This was led by Latin America, which posted internal net sales gains of 13% and 15% for the year and quarter, respectively, thanks to continued growth in cereal and snacks in Mexico. In Europe, sales were up 3% on an internal basis in 2003, and flat in the fourth quarter; gains were posted in both periods by the United Kingdom, which increased its share of the ready-to-eat cereal category by a full percentage point in 2003. All other international businesses collectively recorded 4% internal net sales growth for both the full year and the fourth quarter. Operating profit of $1.5 billion in 2003 was a 2% increase over 2002, while it declined by 11%, to $352 million, in the fourth quarter. In both periods, operating profit was held down by substantial reinvestment for the future. Advertising and consumer promotion was increased at a double-digit rate in 2003, and its growth was accelerated during the fourth quarter. In addition, the Company absorbed substantial asset write-offs and up-front costs related to productivity initiatives, such as capacity rationalizations in Australia, Argentina and the U.S., as well as other supply-chain and overhead reductions in Europe. As expected, the net earnings impact of these costs and additional expense related to a repurchase of bonds was partially offset by a reduction in tax expense, the result of various tax planning initiatives and audit completions. Cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $961 million in 2003, before the $37 million after-tax impact of year-end voluntary contributions to benefit plans. The Company used this cash flow to reduce its debt outstanding by more than $550 million in 2003, including more than $200 million in the fourth quarter alone. Kellogg Reaffirms 2004 Outlook Kellogg reiterated its outlook for full-year EPS for the high-end of the range $2.05-2.09, toward the upper end of its long-term target of high single-digit EPS growth. The Company expects to face substantially higher commodity and benefit costs, continued competitive pressure, and a weak cookie category. However, management believes virtually all of its businesses are demonstrating momentum and have strong plans for brand building and innovation. A combination of operating leverage, mix improvement, and productivity savings is expected to more than offset the additional costs. Mr. Gutierrez concluded, "In 2003, we executed well, delivered strong results, and reinvested for the future. The year was a testament to the focus, hard work, and dedication of our 25,000 employees. It also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for our share owners. I have every confidence in our ability to deliver again in 2004, and beyond."
