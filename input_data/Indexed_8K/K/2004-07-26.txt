Kellogg Company News For release: July 26, 2004 Contact: Simon D. Burton, CFA (269) 961-6636 KELLOGG ANNOUNCES 14% EPS GROWTH DUE TO STRONG MOMENTUM BATTLE CREEK, Mich. - Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today reported that its earnings in the second quarter of 2004 exceeded expectations despite significant increases in investment for future growth. Reported net earnings for the quarter increased to $237.4 million from $203.9 million in the comparable period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.57, a 14% increase from last year's $0.50 per share. This result was due to successful execution and continued sales growth across the Company. "This was another excellent quarter," said Carlos Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our sales growth remained very strong as our business momentum continued, and we also continued to make significant investments in future growth. It is particularly gratifying that we were able to achieve this excellent performance while absorbing increased commodity and benefit costs." Reported net sales in the quarter increased by 6% to $2.4 billion. Internal net sales growth, which excludes the effect of foreign-currency translation, was 5%. This strong growth builds on a very strong first quarter and the 3.5% growth posted during the comparable period last year. Kellogg North America reported net sales growth of 5%. North American retail cereal sales increased by 2%, measured in local currencies, as a result of the introduction of innovative new products, brand-building initiatives, and successful consumer promotions. Retail snacks sales increased by 7% due to innovation and improved execution. The North America Frozen & Specialty Channels businesses collectively posted internal sales growth of 4%, which built on the excellent 5% growth posted in the comparable period last year. This increase was largely attributable to continued gains by the Eggo brand. Kellogg International reported net sales growth of 9% in the quarter, or 5% in local currencies. Sales in Latin America increased by 16%, excluding the effect of currency translation, led by exceptional growth in both cereal and snacks. Europe's sales growth, measured in local currencies, was 3%, as the area continued to benefit from innovation and successful brand building. Local currency sales in the Asia Pacific region declined by 6% due to weakness in Australia and Korea. Operating profit was $438 million in the quarter, a 6% increase over the comparable period last year; internal operating profit growth was 4 percent. Higher net sales, improvements in product mix, and increased efficiency drove the gain and more than offset increased commodity costs, significantly higher investment in brand building, and up-front costs related to cost-reduction projects of more than $0.03 per share. Net earnings growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. Cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $177 million in the quarter, which brought year-to-date cash flow to $388 million. This approximates the 2003 year-to-date total and remains in line with internal expectations. Once again, the quarter featured markedly improved working capital efficiency and disciplined capital expenditure. Kellogg Reaffirms 2004 Outlook Kellogg reiterates its earnings outlook for 2004 of $2.07-2.11 per share. This represents growth of 8-10%, modestly above the Company's long-term target of high single-digit growth. Once again increasing the quality of its earnings, Kellogg also announces that this range now includes a higher estimate for up-front costs related to capacity rationalizations and other cost-reduction initiatives. The Company now expects these costs to equal $0.14-0.16 per share, or $0.04 higher than the previously projected range of $0.10-0.12 per share. This range had been raised from an initial projection of $0.05 per share. Mr. Gutierrez concluded, "These results only give us more confidence that we will achieve our goals in 2004, while investing significantly for growth in the future and absorbing increased commodity and benefit costs. We will continue to execute our proven strategy, which should allow us to deliver dependable, sustainable growth into the future."

Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure This news release contains forward-looking statements related to business performance, sales, costs, strategy, operating profit, earnings, and growth. Actual performance may differ materially from these statements due to factors related to the substantial amount of indebtedness incurred to finance the Keebler Foods acquisition (which could, among other things, hinder the Company's ability to adjust rapidly, make the Company more vulnerable to a downturn, and place the Company at a competitive disadvantage to less-leveraged companies); competitive conditions and their impact; the effectiveness of advertising, pricing and promotional spending; the success of productivity improvements and business transitions; the success of innovation and new product introductions; the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles; the availability of and interest rates on short-term financing; commodity and energy prices and labor costs; actual market performance of benefit plan trust investments; the levels of spending on systems initiatives, properties, business opportunities, integration of acquired businesses; changes in consumer behavior and preferences; U.S. and foreign economic factors such as interest rates, statutory tax rates, and foreign currency conversions or unavailability; legal and regulatory factors; business disruption or other losses from terrorist acts or political unrest; and other factors.
