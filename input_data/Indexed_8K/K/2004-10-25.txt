Kellogg Company News For release: October 25, 2004 Media/Analyst Contact: Simon D. Burton, CFA (269) 961-6636 KELLOGG EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS AND RAISES GUIDANCE BATTLE CREEK, Mich. - Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today reported third quarter earnings growth driven by increased sales, investment, and effective execution. The Company raised its earnings guidance for the full year of 2004 due to these strong results and continued business momentum. Reported net earnings for the quarter increased by 7% to $247.0 million from $231.3 million in the comparable period of last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, an increase of 5% from last year's $0.56 per share. Reported net earnings for the first nine months of the year increased by 18% to $704.2 million, or $1.69 per share, compared to $599.1 million last year, or $1.46 per share. Earnings per share growth during the first nine months of 2004 was 16 percent. "We are very pleased with our strong results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. We are especially pleased that we could generate strong sales and earnings growth while continuing to make significant investments in our business," said Carlos Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer. "It is this investment, and our business momentum, that helps to provide visibility for the remainder of the year and into 2005." Net sales in the third quarter increased by 7.2%, to $2.45 billion. Excluding the effect of currency translation, Kellogg's internal sales growth was 4.8 percent. This internal growth rate built on very strong 4.5% growth posted during the third quarter of last year. Kellogg North America's internal net sales growth was approximately 5% in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year. The third quarter's growth builds on growth of 3% in the comparable period of last year. North America Retail Cereal posted an increase in internal sales of 1%, which builds on very strong 10% growth in the third quarter of 2003. This growth resulted from the introduction of new products throughout the year and successful brand-building programs. The North America Retail Snacks business also had another good quarter, posting internal sales growth of 9 percent. Cookies, Crackers, Wholesome Snacks, and Toaster Pastries all reported increased sales despite some weak category trends. The wholesome snacks business again benefited from the introduction of various varieties of fruit snacks, and Pop-Tarts achieved an 84% share of the toaster pastries category in measured channels. The North America Frozen and Specialty Channels business posted internal net sales growth of 6% as Eggo, Morningstar Farms and the Food Away From Home businesses all contributed strong sales gains. Kellogg International reported net sales growth of approximately 10%, or 4% excluding the effect of currency translation. Each of our geographic segments continues to implement and execute the Company's Volume to Value strategy through significant investment in innovation and brand building. The European business posted currency-adjusted sales growth of approximately 2% in the third quarter and 4% for the year-to-date period. The pan-European snacks business posted good growth as a result of various successful new product introductions and continued investment in brand building. Sales growth in the U.K., the region's largest market, was somewhat limited by the timing of promotional campaigns and product introductions. The Company reported sales growth of 6% in Latin America, or approximately 11% on a currency-neutral basis. The Company's Mexican business, which is the area's largest, reported strong growth in both its cereal and snacks businesses. The Asia Pacific business posted flat local-currency sales in the third quarter and 1% growth for the first three quarters of the year. "Each of our North American cereal, snacks, frozen and specialty channels, and Kellogg International businesses posted excellent results," commented Mr. Gutierrez. "They are all implementing our strategy and it is reflected in this growth." Operating profit in the third quarter increased by approximately 6% to $457 million; operating profit for the year-to-date period has increased by 10 percent. The Company's gross profit margin in the third quarter increased by 80 basis points, despite increased reinvestment in cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, gross margin was also pressured by high commodity costs. The Company offset these headwinds through improvements in mix, productivity savings, and operating leverage. "Our goal is sustainable, long-term growth, and investment in Volume to Value is an essential component of this," said Mr. Gutierrez. "We have continued our significant investment in brand building and innovation throughout this year and have continued to absorb the costs associated with cost-reduction initiatives. It is gratifying that we can make this investment in the future and still report such strong results." Cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditure, was $472 million in the third quarter; the full-year and third quarter totals are approximately equal to last year's results. However, the Company has contributed approximately $80 million more to benefit plans this year than it had at this point in 2003. Core working capital measured as a percentage of rolling twelve-month sales improved for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. Year-to-date, the Company has paid down $272 million of debt. Mr. Gutierrez said, "Each of our employees is focused on cash flow generation and understands their contribution. Through our Manage For Cash strategy we are becoming more efficient generators of cash flow, which is dramatically increasing our financial flexibility." Kellogg Raises 2004 Guidance and Previews 2005 Kellogg raised its guidance for full-year 2004 earnings per share to $2.11-2.13, from its previous range of $2.07-2.11, due to strong business momentum and excellent year-to-date results. In the fourth quarter, the Company expects low single-digit sales growth and net earnings lower than last year, solely due to significant reinvestment in cost-saving initiatives, a dramatic increase in brand-building activity, and a much higher tax rate than in the fourth quarter of 2003. Kellogg also gave preliminary guidance for earnings per share in 2005 of $2.28-2.32; this range is in line with the Company's long-term target of high single-digit growth. The Company expects to post low single-digit net sales growth, before the effects of currency translation and the one fewer shipping week in the fourth quarter. In keeping with its Volume to Value strategy, the Company expects to increase investment in brand building and innovation again in 2005. Mr. Gutierrez concluded, "We constantly strive to meet our goal of long-term sustainable growth and we continue to execute our strategy and invest in the future. It is a testament to our 25,000 employees worldwide that we can report such strong results while laying the foundation for future growth."
