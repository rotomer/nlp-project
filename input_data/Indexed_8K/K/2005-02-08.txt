Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
               On February 4, 2005, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of Kellogg Company (the "Company"), made determinations with respect to certain of the Company's existing benefit plans and adopted the 2005-2007 Executive Performance Plan as set forth below.
               As previously disclosed and filed with our SEC reports, the Company had adopted the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as previously disclosed in our SEC filings, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the 2002-2004 Executive Performance Plan under which certain senior executives were eligible to receive a portion of their long-term incentives in the form of performance units based on the achievement of multi-year sales growth targets. Awards are generally paid in shares unless doing so would result in adverse legal or tax consequences. On February 4, 2005, the Compensation Committee certified that the maximum sales growth goal had been met and exceeded and, consequently, approved the following award amounts under the 2002-2004 Executive Performance Plan to the Company's named executive officers: Mr. Gutierrez, $500,000; Mr. Mackay, $500,000; Mr. Harris, $500,000; Mr. Bryant, $500,000; and Mr. Montie, $469,600. Other officers also received awards under the 2002-2004 Executive Performance Plan.
2002-2004 Executive Performance Plan.
               As previously disclosed in our SEC filings, the Compensation Committee of the Board previously adopted the 2003-2005 Executive Performance Plan under which certain senior executives would be eligible to receive a portion of their long-term incentives in the form of performance units based on the achievement of multi-year gross margin improvement targets. Awards are generally paid in shares unless doing so would result in adverse legal or tax consequences.
2003-2005 Executive Performance Plan.
               On February 4, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the 2005-2007 Executive Performance Plan under which certain senior executives and employees would be eligible to receive a portion of their long-term incentives in the form of performance shares based on the achievement of multi-year net sales growth targets. Awards are paid in shares, except for amounts withheld by the Company for minimum statutory withholding requirements.
2005-2007 Executive Performance Plan.
               As previously disclosed and filed with our SEC reports, the Company had adopted the Senior Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which is a performance-based plan intended to meet the deductibility requirements of IRC Section 162(m). Annual bonuses awarded under the plan are based on a percentage of an executive's base salary and depend primarily on how the Company performs on pre-established performance factors selected from those set forth in the Plan. In February, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined to use net sales, cash flow and operating profit as the performance factors for fiscal year 2004 awards. Those performance factors are also expected to be used for awards for fiscal year 2005 and future years.

               The Company has also previously adopted an Annual Incentive Plan in which many salaried employees of the Company and its subsidiaries participate. Annual bonuses awarded under the plan are based on a percentage of the participant's base salary and depend primarily on how the Company and/or specified business units or groups perform on the performance measures of net sales, cash flow and operating profit.
