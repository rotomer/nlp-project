ITEM 2.05 Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities
On March 16, 2005, the Board of Directors of Kellogg Company (the "Company") conditionally approved a recommendation to close the Company's Macon, Georgia and Des Plaines, Illinois plants and to relocate their production lines to other plants. The recommendation is conditioned upon the conclusion of decision bargaining with the union at each facility. The possible relocation and closure was communicated to affected employees on March 17, 2005. If decision bargaining results in the recommendation being implemented, the relocation of production lines and closure of the Des Plaines plant is currently expected to be completed by year-end 2005 and the relocation of production lines and closure of the Macon plant is currently expected to be completed by mid-year 2006. These activities are part of the Company's previously-announced ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.
In conjunction with the recommendation, the Company currently expects to incur approximately $120 million in total up-front costs, consisting of approximately $70 million in severance (subject to effects bargaining with the union), equipment removal, and other cash costs, including withdrawal liability from a multi-employer pension plan, and $50 million in asset write-offs. The pension plan withdrawal liability is related to trust asset under-performance in a multi-employer plan that covers the majority of the Company's union employees in the Macon plant and is payable over a period which is not to exceed 20 years. The final amount of the pension plan withdrawal liability will not be determinable until after the Macon plant closure. The Company expects to record total up-front costs during 2005 of approximately $85 million, including approximately $20 million in its 2005 fiscal first quarter (subject to completion of decision bargaining with the union) in connection with the recommendation. The Company also expects to incur approximately $70 million in capital expenditures, related primarily to the relocation of production in connection with the recommendation, with approximately $40 million of those expenditures expected to be incurred in 2005.
The Company views its continued spending on cost-reduction initiatives as part of management's ongoing financial strategy to reinvest earnings so as to provide greater reliability in meeting long-term growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must meet certain expected pay-back and internal rate of return (IRR) targets.
