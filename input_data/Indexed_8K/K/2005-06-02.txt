Item 8.01. Other Events
On May 27, 2005 and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 15, 2001 between Kellogg Company (the "Company") and BNY Midwest Trust Company (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of March 29, 2001 (collectively, the "Indenture"), the Company notified the Trustee that the Company had elected to redeem on July 1, 2005 (the "Redemption Date") all the 6.00% Notes due April 1, 2006 (the "Notes") issued under the Indenture (currently, $723.4 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding). All of the Notes outstanding on the Redemption Date are to be redeemed in whole for an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes), plus 25 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined in the Notes), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
The Company does not expect that this redemption will have a material effect on its second quarter or full year 2005 earnings.
