Item 2.05. Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.
Under authority granted by the Board of Directors of Kellogg Company ("the Company"), on June 27, 2007, management of the Company ("we", "our") began to extend offers to exit approximately 517 distribution route franchise agreements with independent contractors, which were substantially accepted as of July 13, 2007. Based on these acceptances, on July 19, 2007, we announced our plan to reorganize our direct store-door delivery (DSD) operations in the southeastern United States. Certain elements of this plan are conditional, pending consultation with union representatives at certain facilities. This DSD reorganization plan is intended to integrate our southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of our U.S. direct store-door operations, resulting in greater efficiency across our nationwide network. The plan is expected to result in the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately 300 employee positions. The Company began notifying affected employees on July 19, 2007. To complete this initiative, we currently expect to incur $75-$85 million of total project costs, principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a lesser extent, employee separation benefits. Based on acceptances received through June 30, 2007, we currently expect to recognize approximately $38 million of charges for route franchise settlements in our second quarter 2007 financial results. We currently expect to complete this reorganization by the end of 2007.
We view our continued spending on cost-reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to reinvest earnings so as to provide greater visibility in meeting long-term growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must achieve at least a five-year expected pay-back target.
