Exhibit 99.1
      Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today reported a third quarter 2007 earnings per share increase of 9% and raised its full-year EPS guidance by $0.01 to $2.72-$2.75 per share. In addition, Kellogg increased its estimate of full-year investments in advertising and up-front costs related to cost-reduction initiatives.
BATTLE CREEK, Mich.
     Reported net earnings for the quarter were $305 million, a 9% increase from last year's $281 million. Earnings were $0.76 per diluted share, an increase of 9% from last year's $0.70 per share. This year's third quarter results included up-front costs of approximately $0.05 of earnings per share, $0.03 more than was included in last year's third quarter. In addition, the quarter's tax rate of about 27% benefited from several discrete items.
     "We achieved our goals by remaining focused on our game plan," said David Mackay, Kellogg's chief executive officer. "We continue to lay the groundwork for future growth and reinvest into the business. Our third quarter advertising investment rose at a double-digit rate and we're planning another increase in the fourth quarter. This investment gives us the confidence to once again raise our 2007 earnings guidance. In addition, we are now expecting increased investment in up-front costs."
     Reported net sales in the quarter increased by 6% to $3.0 billion. Excluding the effect of foreign-currency translation, internal net sales growth was 4%, building on growth of 6% in the third quarter of last year.
     Kellogg North America posted reported net sales growth of 4% and internal net sales growth of 3%, driven by growth in the Snacks, Frozen, and Specialty Channels businesses. Internal sales in the Retail Cereal business were unchanged, driven by the building of above-normal customer
 
inventories in the prior year. Measured channel category share and consumer consumption both increased in the quarter. The Retail Snacks business achieved 5% internal sales growth, with each of the toaster pastry, cookie, cracker and wholesome snack businesses contributing to the growth. Together, the North America Frozen and Specialty Channels businesses posted 6% internal net sales growth.
     Kellogg International reported third quarter net sales growth of 12% and internal sales growth of 5%. This internal growth built on a strong comparison to 5% growth posted in the third quarter of last year. The Latin American region achieved internal sales growth of 12%, which built on 7% growth in the comparable quarter of last year. Both the cereal and snacks businesses contributed to these results. Internal net sales in the European business increased by 3% versus last year's 6% growth. The Asia Pacific region posted an internal net sales decline of 1 percent.
     Reported gross margin in the third quarter declined by approximately 40 basis points as the result of higher commodity inflation, which was partially offset by cost savings and a favorable impact from pricing actions.
     Reported operating profit was $492 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1% from the third quarter of last year. Internal operating profit, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, declined 2% in the third quarter. This decline was principally due to a significant year-over-year increase in up-front cost investment, which reduced operating profit by nearly 5%. The Company now expects that up-front costs for the full-year will be approximately $0.19 of earnings per share, an increase of $0.02 from previous expectations. Investment in advertising expense increased at a double-digit rate during the quarter. Increased commodity cost inflation also adversely impacted operating profit.
     Cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $961 million in the first three quarters of the year, a $111 million increase over the same period of 2006. This was driven primarily by net earnings growth. Year-to-date share repurchases have been $417 million. The Company's Board of Directors also approved an additional $650 million share repurchase for 2008. This is in addition to the 2007 authorization for $650 million, which the Company expects to complete by year end.
 
     Kellogg Company expects that full-year earnings will be approximately $2.72 to $2.75 per share, an increase of $0.01 from prior guidance given after the second quarter. The Company expects to achieve this growth despite increased investment in brand building and up-front costs. In addition, the Company increased its estimate for full-year incremental commodity, fuel, energy and benefit costs to $0.32 per share, or an increase of $0.16-$0.19 from original expectations. The Company expects that full-year cash flow will be approximately $1 billion. Full-year internal sales are expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate and operating profit is expected to increase at a low-single digit rate due to the higher amount of up-front costs year-on-year.
     Kellogg also gave preliminary guidance for earnings in 2008 of $2.92-$2.97 per share. As in prior years, this earnings range is in line with the Company's long-term target of high single-digit growth. Although the Company's long-term internal sales growth target of low single-digits has not changed, 2008 internal sales growth is projected at mid single-digits. Internal operating profit is projected to grow at a mid single-digit rate. (Internal sales and operating profit growth exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and if applicable, acquisitions, dispositions, and differences in the number of shipping days).
     Mr. Mackay concluded, "Despite ongoing inflation challenges, we will continue to invest in our business through advertising and cost-saving initiatives, which gives us increased visibility for future growth. We expect to deliver our sixth consecutive year of dependable, sustainable growth in 2007 and we look forward to 2008 with confidence."
 
     With 2006 sales of nearly $11 billion, Kellogg Company is the world's leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen waffles, and veggie foods. The Company's brands include and Kellogg products are manufactured in 17 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries around the world. For more information, visit Kellogg's web site at .
