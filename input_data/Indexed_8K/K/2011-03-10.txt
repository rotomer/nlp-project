(d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Combined Tranche Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender's Combined Tranche Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit, (provided that such letter of credit shall expire no later than the date set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section) or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations.
(e) If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, then, if the Maturity Date shall not have occurred, such Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Combined Tranche Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Combined Tranche Percentage of the payment then due from such Borrower, in

Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
mutatis mutandis
(f) The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (iii) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any of the Issuing Banks, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or

The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
(h) If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest.
provided
(i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the applicable replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.

thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent in liquid, highly-rated investments and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers, as applicable, for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 1:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent (i) in New York City, in the case of Loans denominated in US Dollars, (ii) in London, in the case of Loans denominated in Sterling, Euro or any Designated Foreign Currency other than Canadian Dollars and (iii) in Toronto, in the case of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request.
Funding of Borrowings.
provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
 
to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of (x)(A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, in the case of Loans denominated in US Dollars and (B) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount, in the case of Loans denominated in a Designated Foreign Currency, and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing, as the case may be. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.08. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and any Loans resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrowing may be converted into or continued as a Borrowing with an Interest Period ending after the Maturity Date. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans or Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone or by telecopy, in the case of an election that would result in a Borrowing, by the time and date that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and, if telephonic, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower (or the Company on its behalf). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to (i) change the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing not available to such Borrower under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
 
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, be converted to an ABR Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of any Eurocurrency Borrowing, become due and payable on the last day of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.09. . (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase and Adjustment of Tranche Commitments; Extension of Maturity Date and Commitments

provided
 
(c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under any Tranche under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Tranche.
provided
(d) The Company may at any time and from time to time, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to the applicable Lenders) executed by the Company and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution referred to in this Section being called an ""), which may include any Lender, cause new US Tranche Commitments or Multicurrency Tranche Commitments to be extended by the Increasing Lenders (or cause the existing US Tranche Commitments or Multicurrency Tranche Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be increased, as the case may be) in an amount for each Increasing Lender (which shall not be less than $5,000,000) set forth in such notice; , that (i) the new Commitments and increases in existing Commitments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be greater than US$500,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement and shall not be less than US$25,000,000 (or any portion of such US$500,000,000 aggregate amount remaining unused) for any such increase, (ii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender in the Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans of which such Increasing Lender will participate (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (iii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an ""). New Commitments and increases in Commitments shall become effective on the dates specified in the applicable notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph. Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, (i) such Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder and (ii)  shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the Commitment or Commitments of such Increasing Lender as provided in such Accession Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents with respect to each Borrower consistent with those delivered under Section 4.01(b) and (c), giving effect to such increase and (ii) on the effective date of such increase, the conditions set forth in

Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist
 
for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars, as an ABR Borrowing, or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in any other currency, as a Borrowing bearing interest at such rate as the Lenders and the Company may agree adequately reflects the costs to the Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans (or, in the absence of such agreement, shall be repaid as of the last day of the current Interest Period applicable thereto), (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing in US Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (or such Borrowing shall not be made if the applicable Borrower revokes (and in such circumstances, such Borrowing Request may be revoked notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement) such Borrowing Request by telephonic notice, confirmed promptly in writing, not later than one Business Day prior to the proposed date of such Borrowing) and (iii) any request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Competitive Borrowing denominated in a currency other than US Dollars shall be ineffective; that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by a Borrower for Eurocurrency Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
provided
SECTION 2.15. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except to the extent any such reserve requirement is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London, interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or any Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on an after-tax basis for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's, or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or participating in any Letter of Credit or any Issuing Bank of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit to any Borrowing Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) or any Issuing Bank is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender or such Issuing Bank for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender or such Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). A certificate of such Lender or such Issuing Bank claiming compensation under this paragraph and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and the basis for the calculation of such amount or amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
(d) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, together with supporting documentation or computations, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
 
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.
SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period, applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19 or the CAM Exchange, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, as applicable, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market or bill rate market, as applicable. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, together with supporting documentation or computations, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments.
 
SECTION 2.17. (a) Each payment by any Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Borrower or the Administrative Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, then the amount payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.

(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount and nature of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, by an Issuing Bank or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as reasonably requested by the Company to permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction in, U.S. Federal withholding tax shall deliver to the Company and the
 
Administrative Agent two (2) completed originals of (A) either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY (together with any applicable underlying forms), or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, (B) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption from or reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest," the applicable Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto and a certificate representing that such Foreign Lender (1) is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) is not a "10 percent shareholder" (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code) of any Loan Party, (3) is not a "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code) and (4) is not conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected, or (C) any other applicable document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service certifying as to the entitlement of such Foreign Lender to such exemption, or reduced rate, from United States withholding tax with respect to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in all cases, properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender claiming, as applicable, complete exemption from or reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office. In addition, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.17(e) that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(ii) Each Lender that is a "United States person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "") (y) on or prior to the date such US Lender becomes a US Lender hereunder and (z) from time to time if requested by the Company, shall provide the Administrative Agent and the Company with two original accurate and duly completed United States Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 certifying as to such Lender's entitlement to full exemption from United States backup withholding tax, or any successor forms.

and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(e)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Borrowers, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
provided
(g) Each Lender and Issuing Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that any Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so) attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(g) shall be paid within 10 Business Days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
 
on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account specified on Schedule 2.18 for the account of the applicable Lenders or, in any such case, to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify in a notice delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or to the Swingline Lenders as expressly provided herein shall be made directly to such parties and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan (or of any breakage indemnity in respect of any Loan) shall be made in the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars, except as otherwise expressly provided. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment. Any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to one or more Lenders in the national currency of a member state of the European Union that has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency shall be paid in Euro.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal of the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of any participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, as applicable, of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by
 
the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in US Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated in any Designated Foreign Currency).

Additional Reserve Costs
(b) If and so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements reflected in the Statutory Reserve Rate or the Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of any of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans in any Designated Foreign Currency, such Lender may require the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Loan.

(c) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Company) may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

(i) (x) with respect to any US Swingline Exposure, all or any part of the US Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Combined Tranche Percentages, but only to the extent that no non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure of either Tranche, as increased by its share under such Tranche of such Defaulting US Swingline Exposure, would exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment under such Tranche, (y) with respect to any European Swingline Exposure, all or any part of the European Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Multicurrency Tranche Lenders in accordance with their respective Multicurrency Tranche Percentages, but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Multicurrency
 
Tranche Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's European Swingline Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Multicurrency Tranche Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Commitments, and (z) with respect to any LC Exposure, all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Combined Tranche Percentages, but only to the extent that no non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure of either Tranche, as increased by its share under such Tranche of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure, would exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment under such Tranche;
(ii) if the reallocations described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) (x) prepay the portion of such Defaulting Lender's US Swingline Exposure or European Swingline Exposure that cannot be reallocated and/or (y) cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks only the Borrowers' obligations corresponding to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that cannot be reallocated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with the amounts of such LC Exposure allocated to the non-Defaulting Lenders; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Banks or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Banks until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(vi) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender will be 100% reallocated to non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and participating interests in any newly made
 
Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders of the applicable Tranche in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
(d) If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent entity of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) a Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, such Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to eliminate any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers, each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposures and LC Exposures of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitments and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the US Tranche Loans and/or Multicurrency Tranche Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for the Lenders to hold such Loans in accordance with their applicable Tranche Percentages.
No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section, performance by the Borrowers of their obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of the operation of this Section. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders, any Issuing Bank or any non-Defaulting Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender (and, for the avoidance of doubt, each non-Defaulting Lender shall have a claim against any Defaulting Lender for any losses it may suffer as a result of the operation of this Section).

Each Lender, each person acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by Section 10.04, the Company and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange. Each of the Company, the Borrowers and the Lenders agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests and obligations of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes so executed and delivered; that the failure of the Company or any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note,
provided
 
instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Designated Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by the next paragraph below), but giving effect to assignments after the CAM Exchange Date, it being understood that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all an assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of a single Class of Commitments or Loans.
In the event that, on or after the CAM Exchange Date, the aggregate amount of the Designated Obligations shall change as a result of the making of an LC Disbursement by an Issuing Bank that is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower, then (i) each US Tranche Lender (determined without giving effect to the CAM Exchange) shall, in accordance with Section 2.06(d), promptly purchase from the applicable Issuing Bank a participation in such LC Disbursement in the amount of such US Tranche Lender's applicable US Tranche Percentage of such LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange) and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such LC Disbursement and the purchase of participations therein by the applicable US Tranche Lenders and, in the event distributions shall have been made in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each LC Disbursement been outstanding on the CAM Exchange Date. Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, JPMCB is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and Issuing Banks. Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Any bank serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company, any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company, any Borrower or any Subsidiary that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs and the provisions of Section 10.03 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right (in consultation with, and (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing pursuant to Article VII) with the consent of, the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (in consultation with, and (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing pursuant to Article VII), with the consent of the Company, which shall not unreasonably withhold such consent and which shall, if the retiring Administrative Agent shall so request, designate and approve a successor Administrative Agent) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After an Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
None of the institutions named as Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent or Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Bookrunner on the cover page of this Agreement shall, in their capacities as such, have any duties or responsibilities of any kind under this Agreement.
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder and to induce the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit
 
hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Obligations of the Borrowing Subsidiaries. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations of the Borrowing Subsidiaries may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrowing Subsidiary of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrowing Subsidiary under the provisions of this Agreement any Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) the failure or delay of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Obligations; (e) the failure of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument; (f) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (g) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of the Company as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in favor of any Borrower or Subsidiary or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or otherwise.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Lender or Issuing Bank as applicable, upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Lender or Issuing Bank may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowing Subsidiary to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Lenders in cash an amount equal to the unpaid amount of such Obligation. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any legal prohibition, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of such Lender, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Lender against any losses or expenses (including losses or expenses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates) that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment in full by the Company of any Obligation of any Borrowing Subsidiary, each Lender shall, in a reasonable manner, assign to the Company the amount of such Obligation owed to such Lender and so paid, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Obligation in question was discharged by the Company, or make such disposition thereof as the Company shall direct (all without recourse to any Lender and without any representation or warranty by any Lender). Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrowing Subsidiary to the Lenders (it being understood that, after the discharge of all the Obligations due and payable from such Borrowing Subsidiary, such rights may be exercised by the Company notwithstanding that such Borrowing Subsidiary may remain contingently liable for indemnity or other Obligations).

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereunder and under any other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments.
(b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the written consent of the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, each applicable Borrower (or the Company on behalf of such Borrower); that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable to any Lender hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) waive or change (x) Section 2.18(b) or (c) or any other provision providing for the pro rata sharing of payments among the Lenders in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby or (y) Section 2.02 or any other provision providing for pro rata nature of disbursements by the Lenders, in a manner that would alter the requirement that such disbursements be made pro rata, in each case without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (v) waive or change Section 2.09(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata reduction of the Commitments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (vi) waive or change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Tranche) required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) waive or change any provision of the last three paragraphs of Article VII without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) waive or change any provision of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders under either Tranche differently from those of Lenders under the other Tranche without the written consent of

Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of the adversely affected Tranche, or (ix) release the Company from its obligations under Article IX without the written consent of each Lender; that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms is limited in effect to the rights or duties of Lenders under one of the Tranches may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the requisite percentage in interest of Lenders under the affected Tranche. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Company, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if its rights or obligations are affected thereby, each Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement, including reimbursement obligations with respect to LC Disbursements and interest thereon.

provided
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor setting forth the amount and the nature of the expense or claim, as applicable.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the Loans and the LC Disbursements are registered obligations and the right, title and interest of the Lenders in and to such Loans and LC Disbursements, as the case may be, shall be transferable only in accordance with the terms hereof. This Section 10.04(c) shall be construed so that the Loans and the LC Disbursements are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.

Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

The making of a Loan by an SPC or the participation by such SPC in any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize the applicable Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Bank or such participation in a Letter of Credit were paid or taken, as the case may be by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Bank makes such payment.
