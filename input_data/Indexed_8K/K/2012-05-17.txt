Indemnification of the Underwriters
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information
Indemnification of the Company
 
relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information in the last paragraph on the cover page of the Prospectus, the information in the table on Page S-23 listing the "Underwriters," the "Principal Amount of 2015 Notes," the "Principal Amount of 2017 Notes" and the "Principal Amount of 2022 Notes" and in the third and sixth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" beginning on page S-23 of the Prospectus.
(c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
Notice and Procedures
provided
provided
further
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any
Limitation on Liability

rata
 
amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
8. . This Underwriting Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities or by European Union authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States or a member of the European Union of a national emergency or war or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is so material and adverse as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Underwriting Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
9. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Underwriting Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Underwriting Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Underwriting Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in this Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Underwriting Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Underwriting Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

Underwriters
In connection with the preparation of this letter, I or members of my staff have among other things read:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations which are identified in this letter, I advise you that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Except for the activities described in the immediately preceding section of this letter, I have not undertaken any investigation to determine the facts upon which the advice in this letter is based.
I have assumed for purposes of this letter: each document I have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; and that you have acted in good faith and without notice of any fact which has caused you to reach any conclusion contrary to any of the advice provided in this letter. I have also made other assumptions which I believe to be appropriate for purposes of this letter.
 
In preparing this letter I have relied without independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Underwriting Agreement and other documents specifically identified at the beginning of this letter as having been read by me; (iii) factual information provided to me by the Company or its representatives; and (iv) factual information I have obtained from such other sources as I have deemed reasonable. I have assumed that there has been no relevant change or development between the dates as of which the information cited in the preceding sentence was given and the date of this letter and that the information upon which I have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading. For purposes of numbered paragraph 1, I have relied exclusively upon certificates issued by governmental authorities in the relevant jurisdictions and such opinion is not intended to provide any conclusion or assurance beyond that conveyed by those certificates.
I confirm that I do not have knowledge that has caused me to conclude that my reliance and assumptions cited in the two immediately preceding paragraphs are unwarranted. Whenever this letter provides advice about (or based upon) my knowledge of any particular information or about any information which has or has not come to my attention such advice is based entirely on my conscious awareness and that of the members of my staff referred to above at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears.
I am admitted to practice in the State of Illinois and my advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal law of the State of Illinois or the federal law of the United States, except that the opinions in numbered paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 with respect to due authorization, execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents are based solely on the Delaware General Corporation Law, and represents my opinion as to how that issue would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court in the jurisdiction which enacted such law. None of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter considers or covers: (i) any state securities (or "blue sky") laws or regulations, (ii) any financial statements or supporting schedules (or any notes to any such statements or schedules) or other financial or statistical information set forth or incorporated by reference in (or omitted from) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or (iii) any rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. relating to the compensation of underwriters. This letter does not cover any other laws, statutes, governmental rules or regulations or decisions which in my experience are not usually considered for or covered by opinions like those contained in this letter or are not generally applicable to transactions of the kind covered by the Underwriting Agreement.
This letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. I do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which I did not have knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law other governmental requirement or interpretation thereof covered by any of my opinions or advice, or for any other reason.
 
This letter may be relied upon by the Underwriters only for the purpose served by the provision in the Underwriting Agreement cited in the initial paragraph of this letter in response to which it has been delivered. Without my written consent: (i) no person other than the Underwriters may rely on this letter for any purpose; (ii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any financial statement, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other similar document; (iii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any other document or communication which might encourage reliance upon this letter by any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph; and (iv) copies of this letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of encouraging such reliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kirkland & Ellis LLP may rely upon the opinions set forth in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above for purposes of rendering its opinion to you pursuant to Section 6(h) of the Underwriting Agreement to the same extent as if Kirkland & Ellis LLP were an addressee to this letter.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are issuing this letter in our capacity as special counsel for Kellogg Company (the "") in response to the requirement in Section 6(h) of the Underwriting Agreement dated May 14, 2012 (the "") among the Company and the underwriters named in Schedule 1 thereto (collectively, "" or the ""). Every term which is defined or given a special meaning in the Underwriting Agreement and which is not given a different meaning in this letter has the same meaning it is given in the Underwriting Agreement.
Company
Underwriting Agreement
you
Underwriters
In connection with the preparation of this letter, we have among other things read:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations which are identified in this letter, we advise you that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have not undertaken any investigation to determine the facts upon which the advice in this letter is based.
We have assumed for purposes of this letter: each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; that the Underwriting Agreement and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement (except that we make no such assumption with respect to the Company); and that you have acted in good faith and without notice of any fact which has caused you to reach any conclusion contrary to any of the advice provided in this letter. We have also made other assumptions which we believe to be appropriate for purposes of this letter.
 
In preparing this letter we have relied without independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Underwriting Agreement and other documents specifically identified at the beginning of this letter as having been read by us; (iii) factual information provided to us by the Company or its representatives; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable. We have assumed that there has been no relevant change or development between the dates as of which the information cited in the preceding sentence was given and the date of this letter and that the information upon which we have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading.
We confirm that we do not have knowledge that has caused us to conclude that our reliance and assumptions cited in the two immediately preceding paragraphs are unwarranted. Whenever this letter provides advice about (or based upon) our knowledge of any particular information or about any information which has or has not come to our attention such advice is based entirely on the conscious awareness at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Kirkland & Ellis LLP (Chicago) on the date this letter bears who spent a substantial amount of time representing the Company during the twelve months preceding the date this letter bears.
Each opinion (an "enforceability opinion") in this letter that any particular contract is a valid and binding obligation or is enforceable in accordance with its terms is subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws and judicially developed doctrines in this area such as substantive consolidation and equitable subordination; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity; and (iii) other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on enforceability including statutes of limitations. "General principles of equity" include but are not limited to: principles limiting the availability of specific performance and injunctive relief; principles which limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; principles requiring reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of an agreement by the party seeking enforcement; principles which may permit a party to cure a material failure to perform its obligations; and principles affording equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel. It is possible that terms in a particular contract covered by our enforceability opinion may not prove enforceable for reasons other than those explicitly cited in this letter should an actual enforcement action be brought, but (subject to all the exceptions, qualifications, exclusions and other limitations contained in this letter) such unenforceability would not in our opinion prevent the party entitled to enforce that contract from realizing the principal benefits purported to be provided to that party by the terms in that contract which are covered by our enforceability opinion.
Our advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal law of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the federal law of the United States where specifically referred to, and represents our opinion as to how that issue would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court in the jurisdiction which enacted such law. In our opinion, New York state courts would apply New York state law to resolve state law issues arising under the Transaction Documents. We express no opinion as to what law might be applied by any other courts to resolve any issue addressed by our opinion and we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists between the laws upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which may actually be applied to resolve issues which
 
may arise under the Transaction Documents. The manner in which any particular issue would be treated in any actual court case would depend in part on facts and circumstances particular to the case and would also depend on how the court involved chose to exercise the wide discretionary authority generally available to it. This letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal dispute which may arise in the future. For purposes of the opinions in numbered paragraphs 2 and 3, we have assumed, with your permission and without conducting any research or investigation with respect thereto, the matters opined on in the letters delivered on the date hereof by the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Development and Secretary of the Company, including the corporate power of, and the due authorization, execution and delivery of, the Transaction Documents by the Company and the absence of any conflicts or required consents.
None of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter considers or covers: (i) any state securities (or "blue sky") laws or regulations, (ii) any financial statements or supporting schedules (or any notes to any such statements or schedules) or other financial or statistical information set forth or incorporated by reference in (or omitted from) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or (iii) any rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. relating to the compensation of underwriters. In addition, none of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter covers or otherwise addresses any of the following types of provisions which may be contained in the Transaction Documents: (i) provisions mandating contribution towards judgments or settlements among various parties; (ii) waivers of benefits and rights to the extent they cannot be waived under applicable law; (iii) provisions providing for liquidated damages, late charges and prepayment charges, in each case if deemed to constitute penalties; (iv) provisions which might require indemnification or contribution in violation of general principles of equity or public policy, including, without limitation, indemnification or contribution obligations which arise out of the failure to comply with applicable state or federal securities laws; or (v) requirements in the Transaction Documents specifying that provisions thereof may only be waived in writing (these provisions may not be valid, binding or enforceable to the extent that an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created modifying any provision of such documents). This letter does not cover any other laws, statutes, governmental rules or regulations or decisions which in our experience are not usually considered for or covered by opinions like those contained in this letter or are not generally applicable to transactions of the kind covered by the Underwriting Agreement.
This letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which we did not have knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law other governmental requirement or interpretation thereof covered by any of our opinions or advice, or for any other reason.
This letter may be relied upon by the Underwriters only for the purpose served by the provision in the Underwriting Agreement cited in the initial paragraph of this letter in response to which it has been delivered. Without our written consent: (i) no person other than the Underwriters may rely on this letter for any purpose; (ii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any financial statement, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other similar document; (iii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any other document or communication which might
 
encourage reliance upon this letter by any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph; and (iv) copies of this letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of encouraging such reliance.
Very truly yours,
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP

Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC" and the "Depository"), to the Company (as defined below) or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
Kellogg Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum set forth above or such other principal sum on the Schedule of Exchanges attached hereto (which shall not exceed U.S.$ 350,000,000) on May 15, 2015, and to pay interest thereon from May 17, 2012, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on May 15 and November 15 in each year, commencing November 15, 2012, at the rate of 1.125% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the April 30 or October 30 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such interest payment date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Securityholder on such regular record date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Securityholders of this Series not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , , that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Security Register, provided that such Person shall have given the Trustee written wire instructions at least five Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
provided
however
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Dated: May 17, 2012
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: May 17, 2012
 
Section 1.
Indenture
The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Indenture"). The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of such terms and provisions.
The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company initially limited to $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding. This Security is one of a Series designated as 1.125% Senior Notes due 2015 of the Company.
Section 2.
Optional Redemption

Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Securities that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered Securityholders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the Securities and the Indenture. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company will mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Securityholder of the Securities to be redeemed. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.

means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Issue"
