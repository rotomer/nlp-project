Section 2.7
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
The Securities shall be issuable in denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3.

For the purposes of disclosure under the (Canada), the yearly rate of interest which is equivalent to any rate of interest payable under a Security, which is to be calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year, may be determined by multiplying the rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year in which the period for which interest at such rate is payable and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. The Securities shall be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Company executing the same may determine with the approval of any Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.

The term "" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except for a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular Series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the close of business on the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the close of business on the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.

defaulted interest
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any defaulted interest to the persons in whose names any such Registered Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustees in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such Series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with any Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such defaulted interest as in this clause provided.

Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such defaulted interest in respect of Registered Securities of such Series shall be paid to the person in whose names such Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered on such special record date and such defaulted interest shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest on the Registered Securities of any Series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of that Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustees of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustees.
Any defaulted interest payable in respect of any Security of any Series which is not a Registered Security shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustees in such manner that there is no discrimination as between the Holders of Registered Securities and other Securities of the same Series, and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustees, in the name and at the expense of the Company, by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in New York, New York and London, England or, in the case of Securities denominated in Canadian Dollars, by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in Toronto, Canada.

At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of a Series, which by their terms provide for the issuance of Unregistered Securities, may, to the extent and under the circumstances specified pursuant to Section 2.3, be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such Series. Securities so issued in exchange for other Securities shall be of any authorized denomination and of like principal amount and maturity date, interest rate or method of determining interest, and shall be issued upon surrender of the Securities for which they are to be exchanged and, in the case of Coupon Securities, together with all unmatured Coupons and matured Coupons in default appertaining thereto, at the office of the Company provided for in Section 3.2 and upon payment, if the Company shall require, of charges provided therein. Unregistered Securities of any Series issued in exchange for Registered Securities of such Series between the regular record date for such Registered Security and the next interest payment date will be issued without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date, and Unregistered Securities surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities between such dates shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and any Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Unregistered Security will not be delivered in exchange for a Registered Security or Securities unless the Trustees receive a certificate signed by the person entitled to delivery of such Security or other items or documents fulfilling such conditions as shall be required by regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury, or shall be notified by the Company that such a certificate shall not be required by such regulations; , , that no such Unregistered Security shall be delivered by the Trustees if the Trustees or such agent shall have, or shall have been notified in writing by the Company that the Company has, actual knowledge that such certificate is false.

Any Security so registered shall be transferable on the registry books of the Company upon presentation of such Security at such office or agency for similar notation thereon, but such Security may be discharged from registration by being in a like manner transferred to bearer, whereupon transferability by delivery shall be restored. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, Unregistered Securities shall continue to be subject to successive registrations and discharges from registration at the option of the Holders thereof.
Unregistered Securities shall be transferable by delivery, except while registered as to principal. Registration of any Coupon Security shall not effect the transferability by delivery of the Coupons appertaining thereto which shall continue to be payable to bearer and transferable by delivery.

Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustees) connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security or Coupon, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon); provided, however, that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of such Coupons at an office or agency of the Company located outside of the United States or Canada, unless otherwise provided pursuant to 2.3, if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustees and any agent of the Company or the Trustees such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustees and any agent of the Company or the Trustees evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.

Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable Series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such Series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such Series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 10.4, pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) Series, the Company, the predecessor Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable Series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
No successor trustee with respect to any Series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9.
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, the Company shall give notice in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 12.4 to the Holders of Securities of any Series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Company fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.
 
Section 6.12
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
Any corporation into which any Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Trustee, shall be the successor of such Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.8 applicable to such Trustee and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9 applicable to such Trustee, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
In case at the time such successor to such Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any Series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to such Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any Series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to such Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such Series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any Series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
Section 6.13
Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company
If and when any Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
Section 6.14
Securityholder List
A Securityholder may, upon payment to a Trustee of a reasonable fee, require such Trustee to furnish within 10 days after delivering the affidavit or statutory declaration referred to below, a list setting out (i) the name and address of every registered Securityholder, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Securities owned by each registered Securityholder and (iii) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities, each as shown on the records of such Trustee on the day that the affidavit or statutory declaration is delivered to such Trustee. The affidavit or statutory declaration, as the case may be, shall contain (1) the name, address and occupation of the requesting Securityholder, (2) where the requesting Securityholder is a corporation, its name and address for service and (3) a statement that the list will not be used except in connection with an effort to influence the voting of the Securityholders, an offer to acquire Securities or any other matter relating to the Securities or the affairs of the Company or the Guarantor.

Section 6.15
Initial Appointment of Trustee
The Company hereby appoints (i) The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as the initial U.S. Trustee and (ii) BNY Trust Company of Canada as the initial Canadian Trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., and BNY Trust Company of Canada hereby accept such respective appointments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, unless otherwise specified in respect of a Series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.3, if any duty or obligation of a Trustee relates to Securities denominated in Canadian Dollars and Holders thereof, the Canadian Trustee shall have such duty or obligation, and such other provision, including any reference to the U.S. Trustee therein, shall be interpreted to give effect to this paramount provision. Unless the context otherwise requires, any action to be performed by the Trustees under this Indenture (including without limitation the authentication of Notes in accordance with Article Two) may be performed by any one of the Canadian Trustee or the U.S. Trustee or both of them, and any such act shall bind both such Trustees.
Section 7.1
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all Series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustees. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustees and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
(b) The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the Security register.
(c) The amount of Unregistered Securities held by any Person executing any instrument or writing as a Securityholder, the numbers of such Unregistered Securities, and the date of his holding the same may be proved by the production of such Securities or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, broker or member of a national securities exchange (wherever situated), as depositary, if such certificate is in form satisfactory to the Trustees, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Unregistered Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person executing such instrument or writing as a Securityholder, if such certificate or affidavit is in form satisfactory to the Trustees. The Trustees and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Unregistered Security continues until (i) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Unregistered Security is produced, or (ii) such Unregistered Security is produced by some other person, or (iii) such Unregistered Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (iv) such Unregistered Security has been cancelled in accordance with Section 2.10.
 
Section 7.2
Proof of Execution of Instruments
Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustees or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustees.
Section 7.3
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
The Company, the Trustees and any agent of the Company or the Trustees may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such Series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustees nor any agent of the Company or the Trustees shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security.
Section 7.4
Securities Owned by Company Deemed Not Outstanding
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all Series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of Holders of Securities, Securities which are owned by the Company or the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustees shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, and for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustees actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustees the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustees in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustees, the Company shall furnish to the Trustees promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Company or the Guarantor to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustees shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
 
Section 7.5
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustees, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all Series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the corporate trust office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all Series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustees and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.
Section 7.6
Record Date for Determination of Holders Entitled to Vote
The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, set a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Securityholders. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Securityholder made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 4.1) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date, only the Holders on such date (or their duly appointed proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action.
Section 8.1
Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Securityholders

(c) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as its Board of Directors and the Trustees shall consider to be for the protection of the Holders of Securities of any or all Series and, if such additional covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all the Series of Securities stating that such covenants are being added solely for the benefit of such Series, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth (and if such additional Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all Series of the Securities stating that such Events of Default are being added solely for the benefit of such Series); provided, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustees upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such Series to waive such an Event of Default;
(d) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture; or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture or under any supplemental indenture as the Board of Directors and the Guarantor Board may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Securities or the Holders of any Coupons;
(e) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any Series as permitted by Section 2.1 and Section 2.3; or
(f) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more Series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than the one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11.
The Trustees are hereby authorized to join with the Company and the Guarantor, if applicable, in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustees shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustees' own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section 8.1 may be executed without the consent of the Holders of any of the Securities at the time Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 8.2.
Section 8.2
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Securityholders
With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article Seven) of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each Series affected by such supplemental indenture, the Company, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustees for such Series of Securities may, from time to time and at any time, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the as in force at the date of execution thereof if required by law) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such Series; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the stated maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for payment thereof or, if the Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder , or change the Currency in which the principal of any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, in each case without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, (b) reduce the percentage in principal amount of Securities of any Series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture or for any waiver of any past default and its consequences, without the consent of the Holders of each Security so affected, or (c) modify any of the provisions of this Section 8.2 or Section 5.10, without the consent of the Holders of each Security, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder or each Securities of such Series affected thereby.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustees for such Series of Securities of evidence of the consent of Securityholders as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustees for such Series of Securities shall join with the Company and the Guarantor (if applicable) in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects such Trustees' own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case such Trustees may in their discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
 
Promptly after the execution by the Company, the Guarantor (if applicable) and the Trustees of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall give notice in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 12.4 to the Holders of Securities of each Series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear on the Securities register of the Company, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
For the purposes of this Section 8.2 only, if the Securities of any Series are issuable upon the exercise of warrants, each holder of an unexercised and unexpired warrant with respect to such series shall be deemed to be a Holder of Outstanding Securities of such Series in the amount issuable upon the exercise of such warrant. For such purposes, the ownership of any such warrant shall be determined by the Company in a manner consistent with customary commercial practices. The Trustees for such series shall be entitled to rely on an Officers' Certificate as to the principal amount of Securities of such Series in respect of which consents shall have been executed by holders of such warrants.
Section 8.3
Effect of Supplemental Indenture
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustees, the Company, the Guarantor (if applicable) and the Holders of Securities of each Series and Holders of Coupons affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Section 8.4
Documents to Be Given to Trustees
The Trustees, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article Eight complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, or such opinion that is otherwise satisfactory to the Trustees.
Section 8.5

Securities of any Series (including any Coupons appertaining thereto) authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear, upon the direction of the Company, a notation in form satisfactory to the Trustees for the Securities of such Series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to any action taken at any such meeting. If the Company or the Trustees shall so determine, new Securities of any Series and any Coupons appertaining thereto so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustees and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Company, authenticated by the Trustees and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such Series then Outstanding and any Coupons appertaining thereto then Outstanding.
 
Section 9.1
Company or the Guarantor May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Company or the Guarantor with or into any other Person or Persons (whether or not affiliated with the Company), or successive consolidations, amalgamation or mergers in which the Company or the Guarantor or its successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or shall prevent any sale, conveyance or lease of all or substantially all the property of the Company or the Guarantor or any other Person (whether or not affiliated with the Company) authorized to acquire and operate the same; provided, however, and the Company and the Guarantor hereby covenant and agree, that upon any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, other than a merger in which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, is the continuing corporation, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all of the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall be expressly assumed, by supplemental indenture satisfactory in form to the Trustees, executed and delivered to the Trustees, by the Person (if other than the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable,) formed by such consolidation or amalgamation, or with or into which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall have been merged, or by the Person which shall have acquired or leased such property.
Section 9.2
Securities to be Secured in Certain Events
If, upon any consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease in relation to the Guarantor referred to in Section 9.1, or upon any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of any Restricted Subsidiary, or upon any sale, conveyance or lease of all or substantially all the property of any Restricted Subsidiary to any other corporation, any Principal Property of the Guarantor or of any Restricted Subsidiary or any shares of capital stock or indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary which is owned immediately after such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease by the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or a successor to the Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 would thereupon become subject to any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or encumbrance (other than a mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or encumbrance in favor of the Guarantor, a Restricted Subsidiary or any such successor), the Guarantor, prior to or concurrently with such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, will effectively provide that the Guaranty shall be secured (equally and ratably with, if the Guarantor shall determine, any other indebtedness of or guaranteed by the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Guaranty) by a direct lien on such Principal Property, shares of stock or indebtedness, prior to all liens other than any theretofore existing thereon, so long as such Principal Property, shares of stock or indebtedness shall be subject to such mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien or encumbrance.
 
Section 9.3
Successor Person Substituted
In case of any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance, and following such an assumption by the successor Person, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, with the same effect as if it had been named herein. Such successor corporation may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, prior to such succession any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and delivered to the Trustees; and, upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustees shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustees for authentication, and any Securities which such successor Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustees for that purpose. All of the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
In the event of any such sale or conveyance (other than a conveyance by way of lease) the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities and may be liquidated and dissolved.
Section 9.4
Opinion of Counsel to Trustees
The Trustees, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Section 12.5, as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
Section 10.1
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
(A) If at any time (a) the Company shall have paid or caused to be paid the principal of and interest on all the Securities of any Series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto Outstanding hereunder (other than Securities and Coupons which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.9) as and when the same shall have become due and payable, or (b) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustees for cancellation all Securities of any Series and Coupons theretofore authenticated (other than any Securities of such Series and Coupons which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which shall
 
have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.9) or (c)(i) all the Securities of such Series and Coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustees for cancellation shall have become due and payable, or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustees for the giving of notice of redemption, and (ii) the Company shall have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustees as trust funds the entire amount in the currency or currency unit required (other than moneys repaid by the Trustees or any Paying Agent to the Company in accordance with Section 10.4) or Government Obligations maturing as to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times as will ensure the availability of cash sufficient, in the opinion of a firm of independent certified public accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption all Securities of such Series and Coupons (other than any Securities of such Series and Coupons which shall have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which shall have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.9) not theretofore delivered to the Trustees for cancellation, including principal and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity as the case may be, and if, in any such case, the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company with respect to Securities of such Series and Coupons, then this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to Securities of such Series and Coupons (except as to (i) rights of registration of transfer and exchange, and the Company's right of optional redemption, (ii) substitution of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and Coupons, (iii) rights of Holders to receive payments of principal thereof and interest thereon upon the original stated due dates therefor (but not upon acceleration) and remaining rights of the Holders to receive mandatory sinking fund payments, if any, (iv) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustees hereunder and (v) the rights of the Securityholders of such Series as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the Trustees payable to all or any of them), and, subject to Section 10.5, the Trustees, on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging such satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture with respect to such Series; provided, that the rights of Holders of the Securities and Holders of Coupons to receive amounts in respect of principal of and interest on the Securities and Coupons held by them shall not be delayed longer than required by then-applicable mandatory rules or policies of any securities exchange upon which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to reimburse the Trustees for any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred and to compensate the Trustees for any services thereafter reasonably and properly rendered by the Trustees in connection with this Indenture, the Securities of such Series and Coupons.
(B) In addition to the provisions of Section 10.1(A), the Company may terminate its obligations under the Securities of any Series and this Indenture with respect to such Series, except those obligations referred to in the penultimate paragraph of this Section 10.1, if the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustees at their Corporate Trust Office or such other office as the Trustees may designate, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustees, as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Securityholders of such Series for that purpose, (i) cash in the currency or currency unit required or, (ii) Government Obligations maturing as to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times as are sufficient, in the opinion of a firm of independent certified public accountants, without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal or interest, to pay the principal of and interest on the outstanding Securities of such Series and Coupons to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, provided that the Trustees shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to the payment of said principal of and interest on the Outstanding Securities and Coupons of such Series.
 
Such irrevocable trust agreement shall include, among other things, provision for (1) payment of the principal of and interest on the Securities of such Series and Coupons when due (by redemption, sinking fund payments or otherwise), (2) the payment of the expenses of the Trustees incurred or to be incurred in connection with carrying out such trust provisions, (3) rights of registration, transfer, substitution and exchange of Securities of such Series and Coupons in accordance with the terms stated in this Indenture and (4) continuation of the rights and obligations and immunities of the Trustees as against the Securityholders of such Series as stated in this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this Section 10.1(B), the Company's obligations in Sections 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 10.4 and 10.5 shall survive until the Securities of such Series and Coupons, if any, are no longer Outstanding; provided, however, that the Company's obligations in Section 5.1 shall survive only with respect to Events of Default as defined in Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(b) and 5.1(c).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or any Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
If a Guaranty has been provided for a particular Series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.3, the Guarantor further agrees that its Guaranteed Obligations herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, or premium or interest on, any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or any Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.

The Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustees, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article Five for the purposes of any of the Guarantor's Guaranties herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article Five, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purposes of this Section.

On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that any semiannual payment of interest on Registered Securities becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.4 hereof.

If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.3, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside of the United States.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest borne by the Security.

mandatory sinking fund payment
optional sinking fund payment
sinking fund payment date
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Series of Securities in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustees Securities of such Series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Company or receive credit for Securities of such Series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustees for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such Series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Company through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such Series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustees at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any Series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustees a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 12.5) signed by an authorized officer of the Company (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 for the Securities of such Series and except as provided in Section 2.12(b), (e) and (f) hereof), and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such Series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such Series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such Series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing, (d) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such Series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Company intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date and (e) specifying such sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such Series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustees in order for the Company to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustees shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustees with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustees). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustees the Company shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such Series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash (in the currency or currency unit described above) without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such Series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such Series as provided in this Section.
 
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash (in the currency or currency unit described above) on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular Series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such Series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable, or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000, or the equivalent in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable, is available. The Trustees shall select, in the manner provided in Section 13.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such Series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be possible, and shall (if requested in writing by the Company) inform the Company of the serial numbers of the Securities of such Series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities of any Series which are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Company or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be excluded from Securities of such Series eligible for selection for redemption. The Trustees, in the name and at the expense of the Company after the Company provides the Trustees of the redemption information (or the Company, if it shall so notify the Trustees in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such Series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 13.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 13.3) for the redemption of Securities of such Series in part at the option of the Company. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such Series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such Series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular Series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such Series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such Series at maturity.
The Trustees shall not convert any currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such Series are payable for the purposes of such sinking fund application unless specifically requested to do so by the Company, and any such conversion agreed to by the Trustees in response to such request shall be for the account and at the expense of the Company and shall not affect the Company's obligation to pay the Holders in the currency or currency unit to which such Holder may be entitled.
 
Not later than 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the sinking fund payment date, the Company shall have paid to the Trustees in cash (in the currency or currency unit described in the third paragraph of this Section 13.5) or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustees shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a Series with sinking fund moneys or mail or publish any notice of redemption of Securities for such Series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing or publication of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustees shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such Series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article Five and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
Section 13.6
Repayment at the Option of the Holders
Securities of any Series which are repayable at the option of the Holders thereof before their stated maturity shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such Series.
The repayment of any principal amount of Securities pursuant to such option of the Holder to require repayment of Securities before their stated maturity, for purposes of Section 10.1, shall not operate as a payment, redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the Company, at its option, shall deliver or surrender the same to the Trustees with a directive that such Securities be cancelled.
