Exhibit 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: JOHN FULLER ANALYST CONTACT: VERNON L. PATTERSON 216.689.8140 216.689.0520 KEY MEDIA INVESTOR RELATIONS NEWSROOM: www.Key.com/newsroom INFORMATION: www.Key.com/ir FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2002 EARNINGS -------------------------------------------- - - EPS OF $0.57 - - REVENUE UP, EXPENSES STABLE - - NONPERFORMING LOANS DOWN - - STRATEGIC ACTIONS PRODUCING FAVORABLE RESULTS CLEVELAND, July 16, 2002 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter net income of $246 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, compared with first quarter net income of $240 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share. "Just like the first quarter's results, our second quarter results were solid," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Positive revenue, expense control and asset quality performance during the quarter demonstrate that the strategic actions we took in last year's second and fourth quarters are paying off." During the second quarter of last year, Key reported a net loss of $160 million, or $0.38 per common share. The loss reflects charges associated with the company's implementation of several strategic actions, including exiting the automobile leasing business, de-emphasizing indirect automobile lending, discontinuing certain credit-only relationships and bolstering the loan loss reserve. At that time, Key announced that it would return to its relationship banking roots and conservative credit culture. "Revenue increased by $34 million from last quarter and expense growth was kept to a minimum," said Meyer. "In addition, nonperforming loans decreased slightly and net loan charge-offs were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Moreover, we are comfortable with the level of loan loss reserves in both our continuing and run-off portfolios." SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew to $721 million for the second quarter of 2002 from $702 million in the previous quarter. This improvement was attributable to a 5 basis point rise in Key's net interest margin to 3.98% and to an increase of nearly $600 million in average earning assets. The increase in earning assets was due primarily to continued growth in home equity lending and a higher level of securities. Compared with the second quarter of 2001, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $2 million, reflecting a higher net interest margin, which more than offset the effect of a 5% decrease in average earning assets. The decrease in earning assets was attributable primarily to the impact of strategic actions, loan sales and weaker loan demand.
KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS JULY 16, 2002 PAGE 2 Key's noninterest income was $448 million for the second quarter of 2002, up from $443 million in the prior quarter. Higher income from investment banking activities (up $13 million) and service charges on deposit accounts (up $4 million) drove the increase. These positive results were offset in part by an $11 million decrease in income from dealer trading and derivatives. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income rose by $50 million. Included in last year's results is a $40 million charge taken to create a reserve for losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles. Noninterest expense of $665 million for the second quarter of 2002 was up slightly from $661 million for the first three months of this year. Compared with the second quarter of 2001, noninterest expense was down by $193 million. Results for the year-ago quarter include nonrecurring charges of $172 million, most of which were associated with the strategic actions implemented in that quarter. In addition, the January 1, 2002, adoption of new accounting guidance for goodwill resulted in an expense reduction of approximately $20 million. ASSET QUALITY Key's provision for loan losses was $135 million for the second quarter of 2002, essentially unchanged from the amount for the previous quarter and down significantly from $401 million for the second quarter of 2001. Net loan charge-offs totaled $203 million for the quarter, compared with $206 million for the previous quarter and $171 million for the year-ago quarter. Included in second quarter 2002 net charge-offs is $68 million of losses charged to the nonreplenishable allowance. In 2001, management set apart $490 million ($300 million of which was recorded in the second quarter) of Key's provision for loan losses as part of its decision to eliminate nonrelationship lending in the leveraged financing and nationally syndicated lending businesses and for the sales of distressed loans in other portfolios. The resulting segregated allowance is being used to exit approximately $2.7 billion in related commitments (which were moved to the run-off portfolio in May 2001) and for losses incurred in connection with loan sales. As losses are charged to this segregated allowance, Key does not intend to replenish it. Within the run-off portfolio, approximately $1.1 billion of commitments (including $724 million of loans outstanding) remained as of June 30, 2002. The following table summarizes certain asset quality indicators, segregated between Key's continuing and run-off loan portfolios. ASSET QUALITY INDICATORS (a) Includes activity related to the run-off loan portfolio and to the sales of distressed loans. N/M = Not Meaningful
KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS JULY 16, 2002 PAGE 3 The level of Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $16 million during the second quarter, reflecting a significant reduction in nonperforming loans related to the health care industry. This improvement was offset in part by a higher level of nonperforming loans in the middle market portfolio. As shown in the preceding table, nonperforming loans in the run-off portfolio totaled $132 million at June 30, 2002, compared with $208 million at March 31, 2002. CAPITAL Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" benchmarks at June 30, 2002. During the second quarter, Key did not repurchase any of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. There were 16.8 million shares remaining for repurchase under this authorization as of June 30, 2002. LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS The table below summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue and net income (loss) for the periods presented. The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major business groups are shown in the related discussions that follow and are described under the heading "Line of Business Descriptions." MAJOR BUSINESS GROUPS (a) Second quarter 2001 results exclude a one-time cumulative charge of $39 million ($24 million after tax) resulting from a prescribed change, applicable to all companies, in the accounting for retained interests in securitized assets (See note (b) below). (b) Reconciling items in the second quarter of 2001 include an additional provision for loan losses of $300 million ($189 million after tax) recorded in connection with Key's decision to eliminate nonrelationship credit-only transactions, a goodwill write-down of $150 million associated with Key's decision to downsize its automobile finance business, a $40 million ($25 million after tax) loss recorded in connection with declines in leased vehicle residual values, a $20 million ($13 million after tax) increase in litigation reserves and other nonrecurring charges of $2 million ($1 million after tax). Also included are charges related to unallocated nonearning assets of corporate support functions and the effect of the accounting change described in note (a) above. N/M = Not Meaningful
KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS JULY 16, 2002 PAGE 4 KEY CONSUMER BANKING GROUP (a) Second quarter 2001 results exclude a one-time cumulative charge of $39 million ($24 million after tax) resulting from a prescribed change, applicable to all companies, in the accounting for retained interests in securitized assets. N/M= Not Meaningful Additional Key Consumer Banking Data Net income for Key Consumer Banking was $115 million for the second quarter of 2002, representing an $8 million increase from the year-ago quarter. The improvement is attributable to an increase in noninterest income and a reduction in noninterest expense, offset in part by a decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income and a higher provision for loan losses. Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $5 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2001 due to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and a decline in average deposits outstanding. The adverse effect of these factors was partially offset by a more favorable spread on earning assets. Noninterest income grew by $15 million, or 14%, due primarily to a $9 million increase in income from service charges on deposit accounts contributed by the Retail Banking and Small Business lines of business. This growth resulted from new pricing implemented in mid-2001 in connection with PEG (Perform, Excel, Grow), Key's competitiveness improvement initiative. Also contributing to the growth in noninterest income are lower losses from retained interests in previously securitized assets and from trading activities. Noninterest expense was down $5 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2001. This improvement reflects
KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS JULY 16, 2002 PAGE 5 an approximate $9 million reduction in goodwill amortization, which resulted from the adoption of new accounting guidance on January 1, as well as lower costs for software amortization. These reductions were partially offset by higher costs related to personnel, marketing and activities associated with a higher volume of home equity lending. The $8 million, or 15%, increase in the provision for loan losses reflects the growth in lending in the National Home Equity line of business. KEY CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP Additional Key Corporate Finance Data dollars in billions 2Q02 1Q02 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Average loans and leases $29.6 $29.8 Average deposits 3.1 3.1 Full-time equivalent employees 1,728 1,750 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Net income for Key Corporate Finance was $100 million for the second quarter of 2002, compared with $105 million for the same period last year. The decrease is due to a reduction in noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income and lower noninterest expense. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $5 million, or 2%, due primarily to a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets and an increase in the taxable-equivalent adjustment related to income derived from the equipment leasing portfolio. At the same time, noninterest income decreased by $20 million, or 30%. In the Corporate Banking line of business, additional income from a significant increase in service charges on deposit accounts was more than offset by lower income from trading activities. The overall reduction in noninterest income also reflects declines in gains from loan sales in the National Commercial Real Estate line and from the residual values of leased equipment in the National Equipment Finance line. A $6 million, or 5%, decrease in noninterest expense was driven by an approximate $4 million reduction in goodwill amortization resulting from the January 1 adoption of new accounting guidance.
KEYCORP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS JULY 16, 2002 PAGE 6 KEY CAPITAL PARTNERS GROUP Additional Key Capital Partners Data dollars in billions 2Q02 1Q02 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Assets under management $70.7 $72.4 Nonmanaged and brokerage assets 72.0 77.8 High Net Worth sales personnel 815 831 Full-time equivalent employees 3,669 3,711 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Net income for Key Capital Partners was $42 million for the second quarter of 2002, up from $32 million in the second quarter of last year. The improvement is attributable to a substantial decrease in noninterest expense and growth in taxable-equivalent net interest income. These positive results more than offset a decline in noninterest income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $2 million, or 4%, from the second quarter of 2001, despite the reduction in average loans outstanding that resulted from the 2001 sale of residential mortgage loans associated with the High Net Worth line of business. The increase is due primarily to the lower cost of short-term borrowings and strong growth in home equity lending. A $6 million, or 3%, decrease in noninterest income is attributable mainly to lower income from derivatives and from foreign exchange in the Capital Markets line and a decrease in income from trading activities in the High Net Worth line. These decreases were offset in part by a $3 million gain from the divestiture of the 401(k) business in the second quarter of 2002. Noninterest expense decreased by $15 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to an approximate $6 million reduction that resulted from the change in accounting for goodwill, and to reduced software amortization.
