Exhibit 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: JOHN FULLER ANALYST CONTACT: VERNON L. PATTERSON 216.689.8140 216.689.0520 KEY MEDIA INVESTOR RELATIONS NEWSROOM: www.Key.com/newsroom INFORMATION: www.Key.com/ir FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2002 EARNINGS ------------------------------------------- - - EPS OF $0.57 - - EXPANDED PRESENCE IN DENVER - - APPOINTMENT OF NEW CFO COMPLETES MANAGEMENT RESTRUCTURING - - STOCK OPTIONS TO BE EXPENSED IN 2003 CLEVELAND, October 17, 2002 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced third quarter net income of $245 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, compared with second quarter net income of $246 million, or $0.57 per share. These results compare with net income of $249 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2001. "Key reported solid third quarter results, despite the challenging economic environment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Positive developments included a slightly higher net interest margin and continued growth in home equity lending. Expenses were down from the prior quarter, as we continue to drive for greater efficiency and to strengthen the company's expense culture. At the same time, revenue continues to be affected by weak loan demand and unfavorable trends in our market-sensitive businesses. Given these trends, we think our fourth quarter results, including earnings per common share, are likely to be very similar to those of the third quarter. "During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Union Bankshares of Denver, Colorado, our first bank acquisition in seven years. We also added industry veteran Jeff Weeden as our new chief financial officer. These actions demonstrate our commitment to growing Key's retail business and to creating the strong management team necessary to drive revenue growth when the economy recovers." In September, Key's Board of Directors approved management's recommendation to begin expensing stock options effective January 1, 2003. "Expensing this form of employee compensation is in line with other actions that we have taken over the past several quarters, such as expanding our line of business disclosures, to provide investors with a clearer picture of Key's financial performance. The change is also consistent with similar actions being taken by many other companies," said Meyer. It is expected to reduce Key's 2003 earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OCTOBER 17, 2002 PAGE 2 SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $722 million for the third quarter of 2002, essentially unchanged from the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin rose to 3.99%, while average earning assets decreased by $496 million. The slight decline in earning assets was due primarily to a lower level of commercial loans, which was offset in part by continued growth in home equity lending and a higher level of securities. Compared with the third quarter of 2001, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $8 million as the positive effect of a higher net interest margin was more than offset by the effect of a 5% decrease in average earning assets. The decrease in earning assets was attributable mainly to the impact of strategic actions initiated last year, loan sales and weaker loan demand. Key's noninterest income was $432 million for the third quarter of 2002, down from $448 million in the prior quarter. Lower income from investment banking and capital markets activities (down $13 million) and from trust and investment services (down $7 million) drove the decrease. These adverse results were offset in part by an increase of $7 million in non-yield-related loan fees. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income decreased by $22 million, reflecting a $9 million decrease in income from trust and investment services and a $17 million increase in losses incurred on lease residual values. Noninterest expense of $659 million for the third quarter of 2002 was down slightly from $665 million for the second quarter. Compared with the third quarter of 2001, noninterest expense improved by $24 million. The largest declines occurred in software amortization and the amortization of goodwill. The January 1, 2002, adoption of new accounting guidance for goodwill resulted in an expense reduction of approximately $20 million for the quarter. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS In September, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation to change Key's method of accounting for stock options granted to eligible employees and directors. Effective January 1, 2003, Key will adopt the fair value method of accounting as outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123. Under SFAS No. 123, companies may either recognize the compensation cost associated with stock options as expense over the respective vesting periods or disclose the pro forma impact on earnings in their audited financial statements. Key has historically followed the latter approach. Management believes that expensing this form of employee compensation is in line with other actions that have been taken over the past several quarters, such as expanding Key's line of business disclosures, to provide investors with a clearer picture of the company's financial performance. The change in accounting will be applied prospectively to all awards granted subsequent to the effective date. Based on the valuation of options granted in 2002, management estimates that the accounting change will reduce Key's diluted earnings per common share by approximately $.04 in 2003.
KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OCTOBER 17, 2002 PAGE 3 ASSET QUALITY Key's provision for loan losses was $135 million for the third quarter of 2002, unchanged from the amount for the previous quarter and up from $116 million for the third quarter of 2001. Net loan charge-offs totaled $185 million for the quarter, compared with $203 million for the previous quarter and $173 million for the year-ago quarter. Included in third quarter 2002 net charge-offs is $50 million of losses charged to the nonreplenished allowance. In 2001, management set apart $490 million (none of which was recorded in the third quarter) of Key's provision for loan losses as part of its decision to eliminate nonrelationship lending in the leveraged financing and nationally syndicated lending businesses and for the sales of distressed loans in other portfolios. The resulting segregated allowance is being used to exit approximately $2.7 billion in related commitments (which were moved to the run-off portfolio in May 2001) and for losses incurred in connection with loan sales. As losses are charged to this segregated allowance, Key does not intend to replenish it. Within the run-off portfolio, approximately $1.0 billion of commitments (including $662 million of loans outstanding) remained as of September 30, 2002. The following table summarizes certain asset quality indicators, segregated between Key's continuing and run-off loan portfolios. ASSET QUALITY INDICATORS (a) Includes activity related to the run-off loan portfolio and to the sales of distressed loans. The level of Key's nonperforming loans rose by $30 million during the third quarter, reflecting increases in the home equity, structured finance and commercial lease financing portfolios. As shown in the preceding table, nonperforming loans in the run-off portfolio totaled $91 million at September 30, 2002, compared with $132 million at June 30, 2002. CAPITAL Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" benchmarks at September 30, 2002. During the third quarter, Key repurchased 1.8 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. There were 15.0 million shares remaining for repurchase under this authorization as of September 30, 2002.

KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OCTOBER 17, 2002 PAGE 5 KEY CONSUMER BANKING GROUP Additional Key Consumer Banking Data Net income for Key Consumer Banking was $122 million for the third quarter of 2002, representing a $3 million decline from the year-ago quarter. Decreases in taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, along with a higher provision for loan losses, more than offset a reduction in noninterest expense. Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $15 million, or 3%, from the third quarter of 2001 due to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits, a decline in average deposits outstanding and an $11 million write-down of the unamortized premium associated with purchased home equity loans. The adverse effect of these factors was partially offset by a more favorable spread on earning assets. Noninterest income decreased by $4 million, or 3%, due primarily to a $9 million increase in losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles in the Indirect Lending line of business. Noninterest expense was down $17 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2001. This improvement includes an approximate $9 million reduction in goodwill amortization, which resulted from the adoption of a new accounting standard on January 1, as well as lower costs for software amortization and a decline in the level of fraud losses. These reductions were partially offset by higher personnel expense. A $9 million, or 17%, increase in the provision for loan losses reflects the growth in lending in the National Home Equity line of business.
KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OCTOBER 17, 2002 PAGE 6 KEY CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP Additional Key Corporate Finance Data dollars in billions 3Q02 2Q02 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average loans and leases $29.1 $29.6 Average deposits 3.4 3.1 Full-time equivalent employees 1,742 1,712 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income for Key Corporate Finance was $106 million for the third quarter of 2002, compared with $98 million for the same period last year. The improvement was attributable to an increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income, as changes in other major components of the income statement were not significant. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $9 million, or 3%, due primarily to a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets and an increase in the taxable-equivalent adjustment related to income derived from the equipment leasing portfolio. At the same time, the level of noninterest income was essentially unchanged, reflecting a number of offsetting factors. Increases in non-yield-related loan fees and loan sale gains in the National Commercial Real Estate line of business and in income from trading activities in the Corporate Banking line were offset by declines in gains from the residual values of leased equipment in the National Equipment Finance line and by lower fees generated by Corporate Banking. A $2 million, or 2%, decrease in noninterest expense was driven by an approximate $4 million reduction in goodwill amortization resulting from the January 1 adoption of a new accounting standard.
KEYCORP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OCTOBER 17, 2002 PAGE 7 KEY CAPITAL PARTNERS GROUP Additional Key Capital Partners Data dollars in billions 3Q02 2Q02 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Assets under management $62.4 $70.7 Nonmanaged and brokerage assets 67.2 72.0 High Net Worth sales personnel 809 815 Full-time equivalent employees 3,547 3,662 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Net income for Key Capital Partners was $38 million for the third quarter of 2002, up from $34 million in the third quarter of last year. The improvement is attributable to a substantial decrease in noninterest expense and growth in taxable-equivalent net interest income. These positive results more than offset a decline in noninterest income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $7 million, or 13%, from the third quarter of 2001, despite the reduction in average loans outstanding that resulted from the 2001 sale of residential mortgage loans associated with the High Net Worth line of business. A primary reason for this increase is a lower cost of short-term borrowings. Noninterest income decreased by $28 million, or 12%, as market-sensitive businesses were adversely affected by the weak economy. The decrease is attributable mainly to declines in trust and investment services income in both the High Net Worth and Victory Capital Management lines and lower income from trading activities and derivatives in the Capital Markets line. Additionally, gains from loan sales in the High Net Worth line totaled $1 million in the current quarter, compared with $7 million a year ago. Noninterest expense decreased by $23 million, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to an approximate $6 million reduction that resulted from the change in accounting for goodwill, lower variable compensation expense associated with revenue generation and reduced software amortization.
