Exhibit 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: JOHN FULLER ANALYST CONTACT: VERNON L. PATTERSON 216.689.8140 216.689.0520 KEY MEDIA INVESTOR RELATIONS NEWSROOM: WWW.KEY.COM/NEWSROOM INFORMATION: WWW.KEY.COM/IR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 2002 EARNINGS - - EPS OF $0.57 FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND $2.27 FOR THE FULL YEAR - - REVENUE UP; EXPENSES STABLE - - NONPERFORMING LOANS DOWN - - DEPOSIT TREND FAVORABLE CLEVELAND, January 15, 2003 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter net income of $245 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share. These results compare with third quarter net income of $245 million, or $0.57 per share, and a net loss of $174 million, or $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter of 2001. Key's 2002 net income was $976 million, or $2.27 per diluted common share. Net income in 2001 totaled $132 million, or $0.31 per share. Last year's results reflect charges to earnings taken in connection with initiatives designed to strengthen the company's future financial performance by emphasizing core relationship businesses and a more conservative risk management culture. "Key delivered consistent quarterly earnings all year long despite continued weakness in the economy and financial markets," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "I believe this consistency demonstrates that the difficult steps we took in 2001 are having their desired effect on our performance. In this respect: - Revenue growth was $26 million in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income. Average core deposits rose by an annualized 22 percent. - Expenses were at their lowest level for any year since 1998. - Nonperforming loans decreased. "The economy's weakness is clearly carrying into 2003 and continues to affect financial markets and the performance of financial institutions, such as Key. Given today's abundant uncertainties, it is prudent to limit comments on the outlook for Key's performance to the first quarter. In that regard, I would expect normal seasonal factors to lead to a decline in first quarter earnings compared to the fourth quarter." SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Taxable-equivalent net interest income improved modestly to $724 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 from $722 million in the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin of 3.98% was essentially unchanged, while average earning assets grew by $471 million. Growth in a moderate size securities portfolio and small increases in both commercial lease financing and home equity lending offset declines in the loan portfolios we are
KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS JANUARY 15, 2003 PAGE 2 strategically downsizing. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $2 million, reflecting a stable net interest margin and a small reduction in average earning assets. Key's noninterest income was $446 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, up from $432 million in the prior quarter. An $8 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities was a primary driver of the improvement. Noninterest income also benefited from increases in nonyield-related loan fees and net gains from sales of securities. These positive results were offset in part by a $9 million decrease in income from trust and investment services, which was adversely affected by market conditions. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts were down $3 million, as we continue to roll out our free checking products to additional markets. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income rose by $28 million, reflecting a $33 million decrease in losses from principal investing. Noninterest expense of $668 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 was up from $659 million for the third quarter, due primarily to an $8 million increase in fees for professional services. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, noninterest expense improved by $34 million. The largest declines occurred in software amortization and the amortization of goodwill. The January 1, 2002, adoption of new accounting guidance for goodwill resulted in an expense reduction of approximately $20 million for the quarter. ASSET QUALITY Key's provision for loan losses was $147 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $135 million for the previous quarter and $723 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Included in last year's amount is a provision of $400 million, which was used to increase the allowance for loan losses for Key's continuing loan portfolio. Another $190 million provision was added last year to the portion of the allowance segregated in the second quarter of 2001 in connection with Key's decision to eliminate nonrelationship lending in the leveraged financing and nationally syndicated lending businesses and to facilitate sales of distressed loans in other portfolios. The segregated portion of the allowance is being used to exit approximately $2.7 billion in related commitments (which were moved to the run-off portfolio in May 2001) and for losses incurred in connection with distressed loan sales. As losses are charged to this segregated allowance, Key does not intend to replenish it. Within the run-off portfolio, approximately $940 million of commitments (including $599 million of loans outstanding) remained as of December 31, 2002. The following table summarizes certain asset quality indicators, segregated between Key's continuing and run-off loan portfolios. ASSET QUALITY INDICATORS (a) Includes activity related to the run-off loan portfolio and to the sales of distressed loans. Net loan charge-offs totaled $186 million for the quarter, compared with $185 million for the previous quarter and $220 million for the year-ago quarter. Included in fourth quarter 2002 net charge-offs are $39 million of losses charged to the nonreplenished (and segregated) allowance, compared with $50 million for the previous quarter and $87 million for the year-ago quarter.
KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS JANUARY 15, 2003 PAGE 3 During the fourth quarter, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $44 million, primarily in the continuing loan portfolio. This improvement reflects reductions in the healthcare and large corporate portfolios, which were offset in part by a $21 million increase in nonperforming home equity loans. CAPITAL Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2002. During the fourth quarter, Key repurchased 1.2 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. There were 13.8 million shares remaining for repurchase under this authorization as of December 31, 2002. LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS The table below summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue and net income for the periods presented. The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major business groups are described under the heading "Line of Business Descriptions." For more detailed financial information pertaining to each business group and its respective lines of business, see the last three pages of this release. MAJOR BUSINESS GROUPS (a) In the fourth quarter of 2001, Reconciling Items include an additional provision for loan losses of $400 million ($252 million after tax) taken to increase the allowance for loan losses for Key's continuing loan portfolio and an additional $190 million ($120 million after tax) provision recorded primarily in connection with Key's decision to discontinue certain credit-only commercial relationships. Reconciling Items in the year-ago quarter also include a $15 million ($9 million after tax) increase in the reserve for customer derivative losses. For all periods presented, Reconciling Items include charges related to unallocated nonearning assets of corporate support functions. N/M = Not Meaningful
KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS JANUARY 15, 2003 PAGE 4 KEY CONSUMER BANKING GROUP TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable, N/M = Not Meaningful Additional Key Consumer Banking Data Net income for the Key Consumer Banking Group was $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, representing a $16 million increase from the year-ago quarter. The improvement is attributable to a rise in noninterest income, a reduction in noninterest expense and a lower provision for loan losses. These positive results were partially offset by a slight decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2001 due to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and a decline in yield-related loan fees in the Indirect Lending line of business. Noninterest income grew by $7 million, or 6%, due primarily to a decrease in net losses from derivatives in the National Home Equity line of business. Also contributing to the growth were higher fees from electronic banking services and mortgage loan processing. These positive results were partially offset by an aggregate $6 million decline in income from service charges on deposit accounts contributed by the Retail Banking and Small Business lines. Noninterest expense was down $14 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2001. The improvement reflects an approximate $9 million reduction in goodwill amortization, which resulted from the adoption of new accounting guidance, as well as lower costs for software amortization and a decline in fraud losses. These reductions were partially offset by higher personnel expense.
KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS JANUARY 15, 2003 PAGE 5 KEY CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable, N/M = Not Meaningful Net income for the Key Corporate Finance Group was $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $118 million for the same period last year. The decrease was due to reductions in taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, as well as a higher provision for loan losses. Noninterest expense was unchanged from the year-ago quarter. Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $10 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2001 as the adverse effect of a decrease in average loans outstanding more than offset the positive effect of an increase in average deposits. At the same time, noninterest income decreased by $2 million, or 2%. Losses from residual values of leased equipment in the National Equipment Finance line of business in the current year and lower fees generated by Corporate Banking more than offset increases in nonyield-related loan fees and loan sale gains in the National Commercial Real Estate line. Noninterest expense was unchanged as an approximate $4 million reduction in goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard was offset by an increase in personnel expense. The provision for loan losses rose by $15 million, or 31%, reflecting a higher level of net charge-offs in the National Equipment Finance line.
KEYCORP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS JANUARY 15, 2003 PAGE 6 KEY CAPITAL PARTNERS GROUP TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable, N/M = Not Meaningful Additional Key Capital Partners Data Net income for the Key Capital Partners Group was $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, up from $35 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement was attributable to a substantial decrease in noninterest expense and growth in taxable-equivalent net interest income. These positive results more than offset a decline in noninterest income and a higher provision for loan losses. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $9 million, or 16%, from the fourth quarter of 2001. The growth was primarily due to a lower cost of short-term borrowings, as well as a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets. Noninterest income decreased by $16 million, or 7%, as market-sensitive businesses were adversely affected by the weak economy. The reduction is attributable mainly to an aggregate decline of $19 million in trust and investment services income in the High Net Worth and Victory Capital Management lines and lower income from trading activities and derivatives in the Capital Markets line. These reductions more than offset a $12 million increase in investment banking income. Noninterest expense decreased by $15 million, or 7%, from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to an approximate $6 million reduction that resulted from the change in accounting for goodwill, lower variable compensation expense associated with revenue generation and reduced software amortization. OTHER SEGMENTS Other segments consist primarily of Treasury, Principal Investing and the net effect of funds transfer pricing. This segment generated a net loss of $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with a net loss of $33 million for the same period last year. The improvement reflects a $33 million ($21 million after tax) decrease in net losses from principal investing.
