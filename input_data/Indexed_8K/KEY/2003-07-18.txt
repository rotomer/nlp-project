Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, July 18, 2003  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter net income of $225 million, or $0.53 per diluted common share. These results compare with net income of $217 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first quarter of 2003.
     "Key's second quarter results reflected improved performance trends relative to our first quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "In that regard:
     "Over the remainder of the year, I expect improvement in our business fundamentals and modest earnings growth. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities, such as our recently announced acquisition of Newbridge Partners, a growth equity investment management firm based in New York City, to ensure that we are well positioned for the anticipated economic rebound. For the full year, we are comfortable with the current analysts' consensus estimate for earnings per share of $2.13."
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income improved to $710 million for the second quarter of 2003 from $703 million in the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin of 3.85% was essentially unchanged from the first quarter, while average earning assets grew by $510 million. The increase in earning assets was due primarily to continued growth in home equity lending and a higher level of securities available for sale. Compared with the second quarter of 2002, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $11 million as the negative effect of a lower net interest margin more than offset the effect of a 2% increase in average earning assets.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2003 Earnings July 18, 2003 Page 2
     The combination of a soft economy and significant growth in core deposits was a factor in both comparisons. Over the past twelve months, core deposit growth has exceeded net loan growth. The excess funds have been either invested in securities or used to reduce wholesale funding. Although these actions improved Key's liquidity, the weak demand for commercial loans has placed pressure on the net interest margin. This pressure is expected to continue as a result of the Federal Reserve's most recent cut in interest rates in June 2003.
     Key's noninterest income was $434 million for the second quarter of 2003, up from $397 million for the prior quarter. Improved results from principal investing (up $22 million) and growth in non-yield-related loan fees (up $9 million) were the primary drivers of the increase. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income decreased by $14 million, reflecting a $27 million decline in income from trust and investment services. Of the $27 million decrease, $14 million is attributable to the June 2002 sale of Key's 401(k) plan recordkeeping business. The remainder is attributable primarily to a decline over the past year in the market value of assets under management.
     Noninterest expense of $688 million for the second quarter of 2003 was up from $657 million in the prior quarter due primarily to higher incentive compensation accruals, an increase in marketing expense and professional fees incurred to enhance Key's sales management systems. Compared with the second quarter of 2002, noninterest expense grew by $23 million, or 3%. The largest increases occurred in professional fees and the cost of employee benefits.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $125 million for the second quarter of 2003, down from $130 million for the first quarter of 2003 and $135 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $141 million, or 0.90% of average loans, compared with $161 million, or 1.04%, for the previous quarter and $203 million, or 1.27%, for the year-ago quarter. Included in second quarter 2003 net charge-offs are $17 million of losses charged to the now depleted portion of Key's allowance for loan losses that had been segregated in connection with management's decision to discontinue many credit-only relationships in the leveraged financing and nationally syndicated lending businesses and to facilitate sales of distressed loans in other portfolios. Considering the progress that has been made in exiting the commitments related to these two portfolios, management believes that it is no longer necessary to segregate the run-off portfolio for reporting purposes.
     During the second quarter, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $67 million, primarily due to reductions in the structured finance and health care portfolios. Nonperforming loans represented 1.32% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2003, down from 1.44% at March 31, 2003, and 1.50% at June 30, 2002. Nonperforming assets represented 1.42% of loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets at June 30, 2003, compared with 1.54% at March 31, 2003, and 1.56% a year ago. Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.4 billion, or 2.22% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2003, compared with $1.4 billion, or 2.27% at March 31, 2003, and $1.5 billion, or 2.41% at June 30, 2002. At June 30, 2003, the allowance for loan losses represented 168% of nonperforming loans, compared with 157% at March 31, 2003, and 161% a year ago.

CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at June 30, 2003. During the second quarter, Key repurchased 3 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. At June 30, 2003, there were 8.8 million shares remaining for repurchase under this authorization. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.90% at quarter end, compared with 6.71% at March 31, 2003, and 6.69% at June 30, 2002.
LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS

Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2003 Earnings July 18, 2003 Page 4
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $100 million for the second quarter of 2003, representing an $8 million decrease from the year-ago quarter. The decline was attributable to a reduction in noninterest income and a higher level of noninterest expense. These negative changes were partially offset by an increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income and a lower provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $11 million, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2002, due largely to an improved interest rate spread on earning assets, a 3% increase in average loans outstanding, primarily in the home equity and commercial portfolios, and a higher level of core deposits. These positive results were offset in part by a decline in yield-related loan fees associated with our efforts to exit the automobile leasing business.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2003 Earnings July 18, 2003 Page 5
     Noninterest income decreased by $3 million, or 2%, due primarily to a $10 million reduction in service charges on deposit accounts generated by the Retail Banking line of business. The decrease in deposit service charges reflects lower overdraft fees, as well as the introduction of free checking products during the second half of 2002. The overall reduction in noninterest income was moderated, however, by increases in mortgage loan processing fees and net gains from loan sales, both in the National Home Equity unit.
     Noninterest expense rose by $25 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2002. Increases in personnel expense, professional fees and various indirect charges accounted for the increase.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $5 million, or 7%, reflecting a lower level of net charge-offs in the Indirect Lending unit. This improvement was largely the result of Key's decision in 2001 to exit the automobile leasing business and to scale back indirect prime automobile lending to footprint markets.
Corporate and Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $92 million for the second quarter of 2003, down from $95 million for the same period last year. A reduction in taxable-equivalent net interest income and higher noninterest expense accounted for the decrease. These negative changes were offset by an increase in noninterest income and a lower provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $8 million, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2002 due primarily to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources, as well as a decline in average loans outstanding. The adverse effect of these factors was partially offset by the positive effect of deposit growth.
     Noninterest income increased by $12 million, or 11%, due primarily to increases in non-yield-related loan fees and net gains from loan sales in the KeyBank Real Estate Capital line of business. In addition, results benefited from higher net gains from the residual values of leased equipment in Key Equipment Finance. These positive changes were partially offset by lower income from investment banking and capital markets activities, mainly in the Corporate Banking line.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2003 Earnings July 18, 2003 Page 6
     Noninterest expense increased by $13 million, or 8%, due primarily to increases in the cost of employee benefits, business and franchise taxes, and various indirect charges.

Additional Investment Management Services Data
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $15 million for the second quarter of 2003, down from $31 million in the second quarter of last year. The decrease was attributable to a significant reduction in noninterest income. This reduction was substantially offset by an increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income and decreases in both noninterest expense and the provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $4 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2002. The growth was due primarily to an improved interest rate spread on earning assets, combined with strong growth in average deposits.
     Noninterest income decreased by $38 million, or 23%, as market-sensitive businesses continue to be adversely affected by the weak economy. The reduction was due primarily to an aggregate decline of $29 million in trust and investment services income in the McDonald Financial Group and in Victory Capital Management. This decline was largely attributable to a decrease over the past year in the market value of assets under management, as well as reduced revenue resulting from the June 2002 sale of Key's 401(k) plan recordkeeping business. Funds that clients elected to move from money market funds under management to FDIC insured deposit accounts with Key also contributed to the decline.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $7 million, or 4%, due primarily to lower variable compensation expense associated with revenue generation.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2003 Earnings July 18, 2003 Page 7
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Treasury, Principal Investing and the net effect of funds transfer pricing. These segments generated net income of $19 million for the second quarter of 2003, compared with net income of $5 million for the same period last year. The improvement reflects net gains of $20 million ($12 million after tax) from principal investing in the second quarter of 2003, compared with net losses of less than $2 million for the year-ago quarter.
