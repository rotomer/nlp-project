Item 9.
Regulation FD Disclosure
On September 10, 2003, Henry L. Meyer III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeffrey B. Weeden, Chief Financial Officer, presented at the Lehman Brothers Financial Services Conference. The presentation addressed the Registrant's corporate strategy. While not the focus of the presentation, the Registrant also provided updated earnings guidance at the Conference. The slide presentation reviewed by the Registrant in the Conference follows as Annex A to this Item 9. In his spoken remarks at the Conference, Mr. Weeden reported that, as a result of higher levels of prepayments in certain investment and loan portfolios and weak loan demand, management expects: (i) the Registrant's net interest margin to decline to approximately 3.70% for the second half of 2003 and (ii) the Registrant's earnings per share to be approximately $2.10 for the full fiscal year 2003.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
