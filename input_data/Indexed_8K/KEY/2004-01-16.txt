Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, January 16, 2004- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter net income of $234 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share. These results compare with net income of $227 million, or $0.53 per share, for the third quarter of 2003, and $245 million, or $0.57 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2002.
     Key's 2003 net income was $903 million, or $2.12 per diluted common share, compared with $976 million, or $2.27 per share in 2002.
     "Key reported solid fourth quarter financial results," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "We improved our net interest margin, continued to grow core deposits, had a stronger performance from our market-sensitive businesses and managed our expenses effectively. Although we saw no improvement in commercial loan growth during the quarter, we were encouraged by the continued steady growth in our commercial lease financing and home equity lending businesses.
     "In addition, Key's asset quality trends remain positive. Nonperforming loans fell by $101 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarterly decrease.
     "We are optimistic that 2004 results will be better than 2003's, given the positive momentum gained in the fourth quarter and a gradually improving economy. For 2004, we expect earnings to be in the range of $.52 to $.55 per share for the first quarter and $2.25 to $2.35 per share for the full year."
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income improved modestly to $693 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 from $690 million in the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin of 3.78% rose 5 basis points, while average earning assets decreased by $510 million. Declines in the levels of commercial loans and securities more than offset continued growth in commercial lease financing and home equity lending. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $31 million, as the negative effect of a lower net interest margin more than offset the effect of a 1% increase in average earning assets.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Earnings January 16, 2004 Page 2
     Key's noninterest income was $466 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up from $463 million for the third quarter. Stronger financial markets contributed to a $16 million increase in investment banking income and an $8 million increase in income from trust and investment services. Noninterest income also benefited from a $10 million decrease in losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles and equipment. These positive results were offset in part by a $10 million decrease in income from dealer trading and derivatives and a $17 million reduction in net gains from loan securitizations and sales; third quarter results benefited from Key's annual education loan securitization. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income grew by $20 million, reflecting a $12 million decrease in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles and equipment. In addition, Key had $8 million of net gains from principal investing in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $13 million of net losses in the fourth quarter of 2002. These improvements were partially offset by lower income from service charges on deposit accounts.
     Noninterest expense was $698 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 and essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, despite a $9 million increase in severance expense. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, noninterest expense grew by $30 million, or 4%. A $25 million rise in personnel expense accounted for most of the growth from the year-ago quarter with the largest increases occurring in pension costs (up $7 million), stock-based compensation (up $6 million) and severance expense (up $5 million).
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $123 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, equal to that for the third quarter of 2003 and down from $147 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $123 million, or 0.78% of average loans, compared with $123 million, or 0.77%, for the previous quarter and $186 million, or 1.18%, for the year-ago quarter. Included in fourth quarter 2002 net charge-offs are $39 million of losses charged to the now depleted portion of Key's allowance for loan losses that had been segregated in connection with management's decision to discontinue many credit-only relationships in the leveraged financing and nationally syndicated lending businesses and to facilitate sales of distressed loans in other portfolios.
     During the fourth quarter of 2003, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $101 million to $694 million, primarily due to reductions in the middle market, large corporate, structured finance and commercial real estate portfolios. Nonperforming loans represented 1.11% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2003, down from 1.27% at September 30, 2003, and 1.51% at December 31, 2002. Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.4 billion, or 2.24% of loans outstanding at both December 31, 2003, and September 30, 2003, compared with $1.5 billion, or 2.32% at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses represented 203% of nonperforming loans, compared with 177% at September 30, 2003, and 154% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2003. During the fourth quarter, risk-based capital ratios for certain prior periods were restated to reflect a more precise risk weighting of certain loans and a more precise measurement and risk weighting of unfunded commitments.
     Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.94% at both December 31, 2003, and September 30, 2003, compared with 6.73% at December 31, 2002. This ratio is currently above management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.

     Key's strong capital position provides the company with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities and to repurchase shares when appropriate. During the fourth quarter, Key repurchased 4 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. At December 31, 2003, there were 21 million shares remaining for repurchase under that authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Earnings January 16, 2004 Page 4
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $108 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, representing a $7 million increase from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to growth in taxable-equivalent net interest income and a lower provision for loan losses, offset in part by higher noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $22 million, or 5%, from the fourth quarter of 2002, due largely to an improved interest rate spread on earning assets; a 5% increase in average loans outstanding, primarily in the home equity portfolio; and a higher level of average core deposits. The positive effects of these factors were offset in part by the adverse effect of a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits.
     Noninterest income decreased by $2 million, or 2%, due primarily to a reduction in service charges on deposit accounts generated by the Retail Banking line of business. The decrease in deposit service charges resulted from lower overdraft fees, as well as the introduction of free checking products during the second half of 2002. This adverse change was substantially offset by an increase in net gains from loan securitizations and sales.
     Noninterest expense rose by $18 million, or 5%, from the fourth quarter of 2002. Most of the increase was attributable to costs associated with other real estate owned, personnel expense and various indirect charges.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Earnings January 16, 2004 Page 5
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $9 million, or 12%, as a result of improved asset quality in the Indirect Lending and Retail Banking businesses.
Corporate and Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up from $100 million for the same period last year. A significant reduction in the provision for loan losses and an increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income drove the improvement, and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $6 million, or 2%, from the fourth quarter of 2002, due primarily to a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets and a higher level of average core deposits. The positive effects of these factors were offset in part by a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources; and a decrease in average loans outstanding. Although the overall demand for commercial loans remained soft, commercial lease financing receivables increased for the tenth consecutive quarter and grew by $687 million, or 10%, from the fourth quarter of 2002.
     Noninterest income increased by $2 million, or 1%, due largely to an increase in non-yield-related loan fees. In addition, the Key Equipment Finance line of business recorded net gains from the residual values of leased equipment in the fourth quarter, compared with net losses a year ago. These positive results were offset partially by a reduction in net gains from loan sales in the KeyBank Real Estate Capital line and a decrease in investment banking and capital markets income in Corporate Banking.
     Noninterest expense rose by $9 million, or 5%, due to increases in personnel expense and various indirect charges.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $18 million, or 27%, as a result of improved asset quality in the Key Equipment Finance line of business.

Investment Management Services
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $33 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up from $30 million for the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was attributable to growth in both taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, and was offset in part by a higher provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $4 million, or 7%, from the fourth quarter of 2002, due primarily to strong growth in average core deposits. The positive effect of this growth was moderated, however, by the adverse effect of a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources.
     Noninterest income rose by $5 million, or 3%, due to a rise in the market value of assets under management, a higher level of brokerage commissions and the implementation of various pricing initiatives during 2003. These positive factors were offset in part by a decline in revenue resulting from the June 2002 sale of the 401(k) plan recordkeeping business.
     The provision for loan losses rose by $3 million, reflecting a higher level of net charge-offs in the McDonald Financial Group.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist of primarily Treasury, Principal Investing and the net effect of funds transfer pricing. These segments generated a net loss of $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with net income of $9 million for the same period last year. The unfavorable change was due primarily to the net effect of funds transfer pricing. Internal rates used to assign credit for new deposits generated by the lines of business were higher than the yields available on various investment opportunities at the time. The decrease in earnings attributable to funds transfer pricing was offset in part by an improvement in principal investing results. For the fourth quarter of 2003, Key had net principal investing gains of $8 million ($5 million after tax), compared with net losses of $13 million ($8 million after tax) for the year-ago quarter.
