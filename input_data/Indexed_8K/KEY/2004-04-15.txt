EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, April 15, 2004  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced first quarter net income of $250 million, or $0.59 per diluted common share. These results compare with net income of $217 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first quarter of 2003.
     "I am very pleased with our first quarter results," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Relative to the year-ago quarter, revenue grew, expenses were stable and asset quality improved significantly.
     "We are particularly pleased with the improved performance of Key's market-sensitive businesses, including trust and investment services, and principal investing. These businesses contributed to a 9% increase in total noninterest income from that reported one year ago. They have benefited not only from strengthening equity markets, but also from the integration of our banking, investments and trust businesses, and our focus on targeted client segments.
     "The improvement in asset quality continues a trend that has been in place for well over a year. Nonperforming loans fell for the sixth consecutive quarter, and net loan charge-offs declined to their lowest level since the first quarter of 2001.
     "We are committed to enhancing shareholder value through effective capital management. In that regard, during the first quarter, Key increased its quarterly dividend and repurchased 8 million of its common shares.
     "We expect earnings to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2004 and $2.30 to $2.45 per share for the full year."

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $685 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $703 million for the year-ago quarter. A 12 basis point reduction in Key's net interest margin drove the decrease, as the level of Key's average earning assets was essentially unchanged. Declines in commercial real estate lending and indirect automobile lease financing were offset by the growth in commercial lease financing and home equity lending.
     Key's noninterest income was $431 million for the first quarter of 2004, up from $397 million for the first three months of 2003. Stronger financial markets contributed to a $14 million increase in income from trust and investment services. In addition, Key recorded net gains of $10 million from principal investing in the first quarter of 2004, compared with net losses of $3 million for the year-ago quarter. Noninterest income also benefited from a $14 million decrease in losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles and equipment, and a $10 million increase in net gains from loan sales. These positive results were partially offset by lower income from trading activities and from service charges on deposit accounts.
     Noninterest expense was $659 million for the first quarter of 2004 and essentially unchanged from the same period last year. Higher personnel expense resulting from an increase in incentive compensation accruals was offset by declines in most of the other major components of noninterest expense.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $81 million for the first quarter of 2004, down from $123 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 and $130 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $111 million, or 0.71% of average loans, compared with $123 million, or 0.78%, for the previous quarter and $161 million, or 1.04%, for the same period last year.
     During the first quarter of 2004, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $107 million to $587 million, primarily due to reductions in the structured finance, large corporate, commercial lease financing and healthcare portfolios. Nonperforming loans represented 0.94% of loans outstanding at March 31, 2004, down from 1.11% at December 31, 2003, and 1.44% at March 31, 2003.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.3 billion, or 2.09% of loans outstanding at March 31, 2004, compared with $1.4 billion, or 2.24% at December 31, 2003, and $1.4 billion, or 2.27% at March 31, 2003. At March 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses represented 222% of nonperforming loans, compared with 203% at December 31, 2003, and 157% a year ago. During the first quarter of 2004, Key reclassified $70 million of its allowance for loan losses to a separate allowance for probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. First quarter earnings and prior period balances were not affected by this reclassification. The separate allowance is included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the balance sheet.

CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at March 31, 2004. In addition, Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.98% at quarter end, compared with 6.94% at December 31, 2003, and 6.71% at March 31, 2003.
     Key's strong capital position provides the company with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities and to repurchase shares when appropriate. During the first quarter of 2004, Key repurchased 8 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. At March 31, 2004, there were 13 million shares remaining for repurchase under that authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
     The following table summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue and net income for the periods presented.

Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Earnings April 15, 2004 Page 4
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $109 million for the first quarter of 2004, representing a $9 million increase from the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses and growth in noninterest income. The positive effects of these factors were offset in part by a decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $8 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2003, due largely to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and a decline in yield-related loan fees resulting from our efforts to exit the automobile leasing business. The adverse effects of these factors were moderated by a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets, and increases in average loans and core deposits.
     Noninterest income increased by $8 million, or 7%, due largely to a $13 million reduction in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles and a $10 million increase in net gains from the sales of loans (primarily those in the home equity portfolio), both in the Consumer Finance line of business. These improvements were offset in part by a $7 million reduction in service charges
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Earnings April 15, 2004 Page 5
on deposit accounts (primarily those generated in the Retail Banking line of business), which resulted from lower overdraft and maintenance fees. Maintenance fees were lower because a higher proportion of Key's clients have elected to use Key's free checking products.
     Noninterest expense rose by $4 million, or 1%, from the first quarter of 2003, and the provision for loan losses decreased by $19 million, or 24%, reflecting improved asset quality in each of the Consumer Banking lines of business.
Corporate & Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $115 million for the first quarter of 2004, up from $95 million for the same period last year. A significant reduction in the provision for loan losses and an increase in noninterest income drove the improvement, and more than offset a decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income and a slight increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $4 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2003, due primarily to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources, and a decrease in average loans outstanding. The adverse effects of these factors were offset in part by a more favorable interest rate spread on earning assets and growth in average deposits.
     During the same period, noninterest income increased by $10 million, or 9%, due largely to an aggregate $6 million increase in letter of credit and non-yield-related loan fees in the KeyBank Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking lines of business.
     Noninterest expense rose by $4 million, or 2%, due primarily to a $6 million increase in personnel expense. This increase was partially offset by a $3 million reduction in professional fees.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $29 million, or 58%, as a result of improved asset quality, primarily in the Corporate Banking line of business.

Investment Management Services
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $32 million for the first quarter of 2004, up from $16 million for the first quarter of last year. The increase was due primarily to growth in noninterest income and a reduction in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $1 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2003, due primarily to strong growth in average core deposits. The positive effect of this growth was moderated, however, by a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources.
     Noninterest income rose by $16 million, or 13%, due to a $15 million increase in income from trust and investment services. This growth was attributable primarily to a rise in the market value of assets under management and a higher level of brokerage commissions, both of which reflected improvements in the equity markets. In addition, trust and investment services income benefited from the implementation of various pricing initiatives and the acquisition of Newbridge Partners, both of which occurred during 2003. Higher income from investment banking activities also contributed to the growth in noninterest income.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $7 million, or 4%, due primarily to lower indirect operations and technology charges.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Treasury and principal investing. These segments generated net income of $7 million for both the first quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2003. A $13 million improvement in principal investing results was offset by a decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income; net losses from the sales of securities, compared with net gains recorded a year-ago; and an increase in noninterest expense.
