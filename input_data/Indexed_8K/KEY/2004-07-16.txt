Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, July 16, 2004  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter net income of $239 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share, compared with $225 million, or $0.53 per share, for the second quarter of 2003. For the first quarter of 2004, net income was $250 million, or $0.59 per diluted common share.
     "Key's performance continued to improve in the second quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Noninterest income benefited from the stronger performance of our market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and other capital markets activities. In addition, asset quality continued to improve as nonperforming loans decreased for the seventh consecutive quarter. At June 30, these loans were at their lowest level since December 31, 1999.
     "We also saw a modest, but encouraging, increase in commercial loan balances during the quarter. The increased demand for commercial loans was geographically broad-based and spread among a number of industry sectors."
     The Company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.61 per share for the third quarter of 2004 and $2.35 to $2.45 per share for the full year.
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $658 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared with $685 million in the previous quarter. A 17 basis point reduction in Key's net interest margin caused the decrease, while average earning assets grew by $493 million. Increases in commercial loans and short-term investments more than offset declines in consumer loans (primarily due to sales in the home equity and indirect lending portfolios) and securities. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $52 million due to a lower net interest margin and a slight reduction in average earning assets.

     Key's noninterest income was $446 million for the second quarter of 2004, up from $431 million for the first quarter. A $27 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities drove the improvement. In addition, noninterest income benefited from smaller increases in several other fee-based components, including electronic banking fees, letter of credit and loan fees, and service charges on deposit accounts. These positive results were offset in part by a $24 million decrease in net gains from loan securitizations and sales. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income grew by $12 million. Stronger financial markets contributed to a $15 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, and an $11 million increase in income from trust and investment services. In addition, Key recorded net gains of $4 million on the residual values of leased vehicles and equipment in the second quarter of 2004, compared with net losses of $7 million for the same period last year. These improvements were partially offset by a $13 million decrease in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, and a $5 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts.
     Noninterest expense of $679 million for the second quarter of 2004 was up from $659 million in the prior quarter, due primarily to an increase in franchise and business tax expense (included in "Other expense"), and higher costs associated with marketing, occupancy and computer processing. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, noninterest expense decreased by $9 million due to a variety of factors.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $74 million for the second quarter of 2004, down from $81 million for the first quarter of 2004 and $125 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $104 million, or 0.67% of average loans, compared with $111 million, or 0.71%, for the previous quarter and $141 million, or 0.90%, for the same period last year.
     During the second quarter of 2004, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $133 million to $454 million, due primarily to reductions in the middle market, large corporate and healthcare portfolios. Nonperforming loans represented 0.71% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2004, down from 0.94% at March 31, 2004, and 1.32% at June 30, 2003.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.3 billion, or 1.99% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2004, compared with $1.3 billion, or 2.09% at March 31, 2004, and $1.4 billion, or 2.22% at June 30, 2003. At June 30, 2004, the allowance for loan losses represented 281% of nonperforming loans, compared with 222% at March 31, 2004, and 168% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at June 30, 2004. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.64% at quarter end, compared with 6.98% at March 31, 2004, and 6.90% at June 30, 2003.

     Key's strong capital position provides the Company with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the second quarter of 2004, Key repurchased 6 million of its common shares under an authorization that allows for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares. At June 30, 2004, there were 7 million shares remaining for repurchase under that authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Major Business Groups
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2004 Earnings July 16, 2004 Page 4
Consumer Banking
Additional Consumer Banking Data
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $98 million for the second quarter of 2004, representing a $4 million decrease from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in taxable-equivalent revenue, which was offset substantially by a decline in noninterest expense and a lower provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $32 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2003, due largely to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits in a historically low interest rate environment.
     Noninterest income decreased slightly from the year-ago quarter, due largely to a $10 million decline in net gains from loan sales in the Consumer Finance line of business. The reduction in loan sale gains was essentially offset by a $9 million decrease in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $10 million, or 3%, due primarily to declines in depreciation expense related to equipment and various indirect charges.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2004 Earnings July 16, 2004 Page 5
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $19 million, or 29%, as a result of improved asset quality in each of the major lines of business.
Corporate and Investment Banking
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $105 million for the second quarter of 2004, up from $86 million for the same period last year. The improvement resulted largely from a significant decrease in the provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $16 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2003, due primarily to a less favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources. The adverse effect of this factor was offset in part by an increase in average earning assets.
     During the same period, noninterest income rose by $12 million, or 10%, due largely to an increase in income from various investment banking and capital markets activities.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $6 million, or 3%, due primarily to lower professional fees and decreases in various indirect charges.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $31 million, or 55%, reflecting improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking and National Equipment Finance lines.

Investment Management Services
Additional Investment Management Services Data
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $24 million for the second quarter of 2004, up from $16 million for the second quarter of last year. The increase was due primarily to growth in noninterest income.
     Noninterest income grew by $16 million, or 13%, due to an increase in income from trust and investment services. This growth was attributable primarily to a rise in the market value of assets under management and a higher level of brokerage commissions, both of which reflect improvements in the equity markets.
     Noninterest expense rose by $2 million, or 1%, due to higher incentive compensation expense related to revenue generation, and an increase in occupancy expense related to the closing of two offices in the McDonald Financial Group. These increases were offset in part by decreases in various indirect charges.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $2 million, or 50%, reflecting improved asset quality in the McDonald Financial Group.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Treasury and principal investing. These segments generated net income of $14 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared with $23 million for the same period last year. Declines in taxable-equivalent net interest income, net gains from principal investing and income from corporate-owned life insurance drove the decrease.
