Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, October 14, 2004  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced third quarter net income of $252 million, or $0.61 per diluted common share, compared with $227 million, or $0.53 per share, for the third quarter of 2003. For the second quarter of 2004, net income was $239 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share.
     "Key reported solid third quarter results with a modest increase in revenue and continued improvement in asset quality," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Contributing to positive momentum was an increase in the net interest margin and stronger loan growth. We continue to be encouraged by the increase in commercial loan balances, which were up an annualized 14% from the prior quarter. The growth in commercial loans was geographically broad-based and spread among a number of industry sectors.
     "Asset quality also continued to improve as nonperforming loans declined for the eighth consecutive quarter and net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans fell to their lowest level since the second quarter of 2000."
     Key expects earnings to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.63 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004.
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose to $680 million for the third quarter of 2004 from $658 million in the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin improved 4 basis points to 3.61%, while average earning assets grew by $1.4 billion, due primarily to an increase in the commercial loan portfolio. Compared with the third quarter of 2003, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $10 million, as the negative effect of a lower net interest margin more than offset the effect of a 2% increase in average earning assets.
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings October 14, 2004 Page 2
     Key's noninterest income was $436 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $446 million for the second quarter. The decrease reflected a $17 million decline in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, due primarily to a reduction in net gains from principal investing and lower income from trading activities. Income from trust and investment services was down $6 million, due to a slowdown in brokerage activities, and net gains from the sales of securities decreased by $7 million. These reductions were substantially offset by a $20 million increase in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, including a $13 million gain from the annual securitization and sale of education loans in the third quarter of 2004. Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income decreased by $27 million, due largely to declines of $18 million in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, and $9 million in service charges on deposit accounts. These reductions were partially offset by net gains of $4 million on the residual values of leased vehicles and equipment in the third quarter of 2004, compared with net losses of $9 million for the same period last year.
     Noninterest expense of $690 million for the third quarter of 2004 was up from $679 million in the prior quarter. Personnel expense rose by $23 million, due to increases in incentive compensation accruals, the cost of employee benefits and costs stemming from stock-based compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $12 million, reflecting lower costs associated with marketing, real estate acquired through foreclosures, and occupancy. Compared with the third quarter of 2003, noninterest expense decreased by $9 million as reductions in a variety of expense components more than offset higher costs for personnel and computer processing.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $51 million for the third quarter of 2004, down from $74 million for the second quarter of 2004 and $123 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $76 million, or 0.47% of average loans, compared with $104 million, or 0.67%, for the previous quarter and $123 million, or 0.77%, for the same period last year. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were at their lowest level since the second quarter of 2000.
     During the third quarter of 2004, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $64 million to $390 million, due primarily to reductions in the middle market, small business and media portfolios. Nonperforming loans represented 0.60% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2004, down from 0.71% at June 30, 2004, and 1.27% at September 30, 2003.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.251 billion, or 1.93% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2004, compared with $1.276 billion, or 1.99% at June 30, 2004, and $1.405 billion, or 2.24% at September 30, 2003. At September 30, 2004, the allowance for loan losses represented 321% of nonperforming loans, compared with 281% at June 30, 2004, and 177% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2004. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.57% at quarter end, compared with 6.64% at June 30, 2004, and 6.94% at September 30, 2003.

     Key's strong capital position provides the Company with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the third quarter of 2004, Key repurchased 2,500,000 of its common shares. At September 30, 2004, there were 29,461,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings October 14, 2004 Page 4
Consumer Banking
Additional Consumer Banking Data
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $118 million for the third quarter of 2004, representing an $8 million increase from the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to a substantially lower provision for loan losses, offset in part by a decrease in noninterest income.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $19 million as a result of improved asset quality in Consumer Finance and Small Business lines of business.
     Noninterest income decreased by $7 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2003, due largely to an $11 million decline in net gains from loan securitizations and sales in the Consumer Finance line of business and a $6 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, primarily in Retail Banking. These reductions were offset partially by a $7 million decrease in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles.

Corporate and Investment Banking
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $112 million for the third quarter of 2004, up from $85 million for the same period last year. A significant decrease in the provision for loan losses and growth in noninterest income drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $49 million, reflecting improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking line of business.
     Noninterest income rose by $8 million, or 7%, due largely to increases of $5 million in both non-yield-related loan fees and income from investment banking and capital markets activities. In addition, Key Equipment Finance recorded net gains of $5 million on the residual values of leased equipment in the third quarter of 2004, compared with a small net loss in the year-ago quarter. These favorable results were offset in part by a decrease in net gains from loan sales.
     Noninterest expense increased by $13 million, or 7%, due primarily to an $8 million increase in personnel expense.

Investment Management Services
Additional Investment Management Services Data
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $27 million for the third quarter of 2004, up from $21 million for the third quarter of last year. The positive effects of a decrease in noninterest expense and a reduction in the provision for loan losses more than offset a decline in noninterest income.
     Noninterest expense declined by $13 million, or 8%, due to a variety of factors, including decreases in computer processing costs and indirect charges.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $4 million, reflecting improved asset quality in the McDonald Financial Group.
     Noninterest income decreased by $7 million, or 5%, due largely to a $4 million decline in brokerage commissions and lower income from the sales of annuities.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Treasury and principal investing. These segments generated net income of $3 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $14 million for the same period last year. Declines in net gains from principal investing and the sales of securities, lower income from corporate-owned life insurance and additional revenue recorded in the third quarter of 2003 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance company in which Key was a policy holder contributed to the decrease.
