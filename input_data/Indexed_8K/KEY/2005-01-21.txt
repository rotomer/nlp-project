EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, January 21, 2005  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter net income of $213 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share. Excluding the effects of the sale of the broker-originated home equity loan portfolio and the reclassification of the indirect automobile loan portfolio to held-for-sale status, adjusted net income for the quarter was $290 million, or $0.70 per share. These results compare with net income of $252 million, or $0.61 per share, for the third quarter of 2004, and $234 million, or $0.55 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2003.
     On a reported basis, Key's net income for 2004 was $954 million, or $2.30 per diluted common share, compared with $903 million, or $2.12 per share in 2003.
     The following table shows the extent to which the above actions contributed to the difference between Key's reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004.

     "Key's fourth quarter results reflect our continued focus on revenue growth and improved asset quality," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Higher levels of both net interest income and adjusted noninterest income generated an increase of $71 million in adjusted total taxable-equivalent revenue relative to the prior quarter. This improvement reflected continued growth in commercial loan balances as well as strengthening financial markets. Also, asset quality continued to improve as nonperforming loans decreased for the ninth consecutive quarter, and core deposit growth was solid.
     "During the quarter, we improved our market share positions by completing the acquisitions of EverTrust Bank and American Express Business Finance Corporation. In addition, we improved our risk profile by selling our broker-originated home equity loan portfolio in December and moving our indirect automobile loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in anticipation of its sale. These actions will result in an improved business mix as we acquired $2.2 billion of loans in lending businesses that provide an opportunity to build customer relationships and moved ahead to sell $2.7 billion of loans in credit-only relationship businesses.
     "Looking ahead, Key is well positioned to benefit from an improving economy. We have successfully repositioned our balance sheet in anticipation of rising interest rates and significantly improved our risk profile. For the first quarter of 2005, we expect earnings to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.63 per share, and for the full year, our expectation is for earnings to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share."
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     To facilitate comparisons between current and prior quarter results, the following Summary of Operations illustrates the financial impact of management's decision to sell Key's broker-originated home equity loan portfolio and its indirect automobile loan portfolio on the major components of Key's income statement for the fourth quarter.
Summary of Operations
TE = Includes taxable-equivalent adjustment of $26 million in 4Q04 and $22 million in 3Q04.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose to $708 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 from $680 million in the previous quarter. Key's net interest margin improved 3 basis points to 3.64%, while average earning assets grew by $2.3 billion, due primarily to increases in all major components of the commercial loan portfolio. This growth was attributable in part to the acquisitions of EverTrust Bank and American Express Business Finance Corporation during the fourth quarter. Compared with the same period last year, taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $15 million, as the positive effect of a 6% increase in average earning assets more than offset the effect of a lower net interest margin.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings January 21, 2005 Page 3
     Excluding the $46 million loss associated with the previously-mentioned decision to sell certain loan portfolios, Key's noninterest income was $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $436 million for the third quarter. Stronger financial markets contributed to an $18 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, while income from trust and investment services grew by $8 million, reflecting an increase in brokerage activities. Noninterest income also benefited from increases of $14 million in letter of credit and loan fees and $8 million in income from corporate-owned life insurance. These positive results were offset in part by lower income from service charges on deposit accounts. Compared with the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income grew by $13 million, due primarily to increases of $16 million in income from dealer trading and derivatives, and $13 million in letter of credit and loan fees. These improvements were partially offset by an $11 million decline in service charges on deposit accounts.
     Key's adjusted noninterest expense of $729 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 was up from $690 million in the prior quarter. Personnel expense rose by $17 million, due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense increased by $22 million, reflecting higher costs associated with marketing, professional fees and a variety of other expense components. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2003, substantially all of the $31 million increase in adjusted noninterest expense was attributable to higher costs associated with personnel. Comparisons to results for the prior and year-ago quarters were also affected by a fourth quarter 2004 reclassification of $9 million of expense from "Franchise and business taxes" to "Income taxes."
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was a credit of $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with expense of $51 million for the third quarter and $123 million for the year-ago quarter. The reduction from the prior quarter was due to two factors. The credit of $21 million resulted from the reversal of provision recorded in prior periods and was done in connection with management's decision to sell Key's indirect automobile loan portfolio. The amount reversed was equal to the remaining allowance allocated to this portfolio after it was marked to fair value and reclassified to held-for-sale status. In addition, as a result of continued improvement in asset quality, Key did not record any provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter of 2004. The following table summarizes the extent to which the above decision and other factors contributed to the change in certain asset quality indicators during the fourth quarter.
Selected Asset Quality Data

KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings January 21, 2005 Page 4
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $140 million, or 0.83% of average loans, compared with $76 million, or 0.47%, for the previous quarter and $123 million, or 0.78%, for the same period last year. As shown in the following table, net loan charge-offs, excluding those recorded on the credit-only relationship consumer loan portfolios that Key is exiting, were $56 million, or 0.35% of adjusted average loans for the fourth quarter of 2004.
Net Loan Charge-offs
N/M = Not Meaningful
     During the fourth quarter of 2004, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $74 million to $316 million. As shown in the Selected Asset Quality Data table, this reduction was attributable primarily to the sale of our broker-originated home equity loan portfolio. Nonperforming loans represented 0.46% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2004, down from 0.60% at September 30, 2004, and 1.11% at December 31, 2003.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.138 billion, or 1.66% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2004, compared with $1.251 billion, or 1.93% at September 30, 2004, and $1.406 billion, or 2.24% at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses represented 360% of nonperforming loans, compared with 321% at September 30, 2004, and 203% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2004. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.35% at quarter end, compared with 6.57% at September 30, 2004, and 6.94% at December 31, 2003.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2004, Key did not repurchase any of its common shares. At December 31, 2004, there were 29,461,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
     The following table summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue and net income for the periods presented. The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major business groups are described under the heading "Line of Business Descriptions." For more detailed financial information pertaining to each business group and its respective lines of business, see the last three pages of this release.
Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings January 21, 2005 Page 6
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $47 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $97 million for the year-ago quarter. The reduction reflected the impact of the sale of the broker-originated home equity loan portfolio, and the reclassification of the indirect automobile loan portfolio to held-for-sale status. These actions resulted in significant decreases in noninterest income and the provision for loan losses, and a substantial increase in noninterest expense. Excluding the effects of the above actions, net income for Consumer Banking was $124 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Noninterest income decreased by $39 million, or 32%, due to a $46 million loss recorded in connection with management's decision to sell the loan portfolios mentioned above, and a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. These adverse changes were offset in part by a decline in net losses from retained interests in previously securitized assets and associated trading activities, higher income from electronic banking activities and a decrease in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2003. The reduction was due largely to improved asset quality in the Consumer Finance and Small Business lines of business, but also reflected a $21 million reversal of provision that resulted from management's decision to sell Key's indirect automobile loan portfolio.
     Noninterest expense rose by $75 million, or 21%, due primarily to a $55 million write-off of goodwill recorded in connection with management's decision to sell the nonprime indirect automobile loan business. Also contributing to the growth were increases in personnel expense and various indirect charges.
     In October 2004, we strengthened our market share position by completing the acquisition of EverTrust Bank, a state-chartered bank headquartered in Everett, Washington with assets of approximately $780 million and deposits of approximately $570 million at the date of acquisition.

Corporate and Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional Corporate and Investment Banking Data
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $162 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, up from $100 million for the same period last year. A significant reduction in the provision for loan losses and growth in both net interest income and noninterest income drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     The provision for loan losses was a negative $30 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. The reduction was due largely to improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking and KeyBank Real Estate Capital lines of business.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $16 million, or 7%, due to strong growth in average loans and deposits, and a more favorable interest rate spread on deposits and other funding sources.
     Noninterest income rose by $22 million, or 15%, due largely to increases in non-yield-related loan fees, and income from investment banking and capital markets activities.
     Noninterest expense increased by $17 million, or 9%, due primarily to an $8 million increase in personnel expense and increases in various indirect charges.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings January 21, 2005 Page 8
     All of Corporate and Investment Banking's income statement components were affected in the fourth quarter by our December acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation, the equipment leasing unit of American Express' small business division headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey. American Express Business Finance provides capital for small and middle market businesses, mostly in the healthcare, information technology, office products, and commercial vehicle/construction industries, and has a leasing portfolio of approximately $1.5 billion. This acquisition added 75 offices to our network for small-ticket lease solutions.
Investment Management Services
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional Investment Management Services Data
     Net income for Investment Management Services was $30 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, up from $27 million for the fourth quarter of last year. The positive effects of an increase in net interest income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses more than offset a decline in noninterest income.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $2 million, or 3%, due primarily to growth in average core deposits and higher loan volume.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $6 million, reflecting improved asset quality in the McDonald Financial Group.
     Noninterest income decreased by $3 million, or 2%. Lower income from trust and investment services and a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts drove the decline.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings January 21, 2005 Page 9
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $7 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with net income of $12 million for the same period last year. A decline in net gains from principal investing drove the decrease.
