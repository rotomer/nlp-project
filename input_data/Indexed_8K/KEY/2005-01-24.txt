Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On January 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of KeyCorp established 2005 performance goals for awards under the KeyCorp Annual Performance Plan. Participants in the Annual Performance Plan are the Chief Executive Officer of KeyCorp and his direct reports. The Committee determined that the performance goals are based on KeyCorp's total revenue. The KeyCorp Annual Performance Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
     As previously disclosed on Form 8-K, on December 28, 2004, KeyCorp executed amendments to freeze the KeyCorp Deferred Compensation Plan, the KeyCorp Supplemental Retirement Plan, the KeyCorp Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan, the KeyCorp Excess 401(k) Savings Plan, and the KeyCorp Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (the "Plans"). The purpose of the amendments was to preserve participants' earned and vested Plan benefits as of December 31, 2004 in accordance with the law in effect prior to the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"). In addition, KeyCorp established new plans, effective January 1, 2005, with terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the frozen plans (the "New Plans") to comply with the requirements of the Act.
     On January 20, 2005, KeyCorp executed restated amendments to the Plans to clarify that in conjunction with the freezing of all additional accruals, contributions, and deferrals under the Plans, all unvested participant Plan benefits as of December 31, 2004 shall be transferred to and calculated under the provisions of the New Plans. The restated amendments to the Plans are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6.
