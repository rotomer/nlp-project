Section 8  Other Events
     As previously reported, McDonald Investments Inc. ("McDonald"), a registered broker-dealer subsidiary of KeyCorp, received subpoenas and inquiries from various regulatory authorities, seeking documents and information as part of their investigations into trading activity involving the mutual fund, brokerage and annuity businesses. McDonald has responded to the various regulatory authorities. On February 22, 2005, McDonald submitted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (the "AWC") to the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") under the terms of which it has agreed to accept a censure and pay a fine of $275,000 in connection with the resolution of the NASD's investigation. In the AWC, McDonald consented, without admitting or denying the NASD's allegations, to the entry of findings that it had failed to establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system and written procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect improper market timing and late trading of mutual funds during specified periods. On March 10, 2005, the NASD's Office of Disciplinary Affairs accepted the AWC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
