EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, April 15, 2005  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced first quarter net income of $264 million, or $0.64 per diluted common share. These results compare with net income of $250 million, or $0.59 per share, for the first quarter of 2004.
     "We're pleased that revenue growth and positive asset quality trends continue to drive Key's improving performance," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Relative to the year-ago quarter, Key's total taxable-equivalent revenue rose by $60 million, reflecting stronger demand for commercial loans and growth in fee income.
     "With regard to asset quality, nonperforming loans decreased for the 10 consecutive quarter, and are at the lowest level we've seen in a decade. Further, net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans fell to their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 1995. While a stronger economy contributed to these positive changes, they also reflect strategic business mix changes we've made to improve Key's risk profile.
th
     "Looking ahead, we expect earnings to range from $0.62 to $0.66 per share for the second quarter of 2005 and from $2.55 to $2.65 per share for the full year."
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose to $722 million for the first quarter of 2005 from $685 million for the year-ago quarter. The positive effect of a $5.8 billion increase in average earning assets, due primarily to increases in all major components of the commercial loan portfolio, more than offset the effect of a lower net interest margin, which decreased 8 basis points to 3.66%. The growth in earning assets was attributable in part to the acquisitions of EverTrust Bank and American Express Business Finance Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2005 Earnings April 15, 2005 Page 2
     Key's noninterest income was $454 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $431 million for the first three months of 2004. The principal driver of the increase was income from investment banking and capital markets activities, which grew by $21 million, due to higher revenue from dealer trading and derivatives. Of this amount, $11 million represented derivative income recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of the indirect automobile loan portfolio as part of a strategy announced last quarter to improve Key's risk profile and business mix. During the first quarter, Key completed the sale of the prime segment of this portfolio, resulting in a gain of $19 million. However, compared with the first quarter of 2004, net gains from loan securitizations and sales decreased by $6 million, due in part to a $9 million impairment charge in the education lending business recorded in the current year.
     During the first quarter of 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued interpretive guidance, applicable to all publicly held companies, related to the accounting for operating leases. Accordingly, Key's noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2005 included a net occupancy charge of $30 million to adjust the accounting for rental expense associated with such leases from an escalating to a straight-line basis. Excluding this catch-up adjustment, noninterest expense was $701 million, compared with $659 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense rose by $17 million and nonpersonnel expense grew by $25 million, with the single largest factor being a $20 million contribution (included in miscellaneous expense) to the KeyCorp Foundation to fund future contributions.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $44 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with a credit of $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 and expense of $81 million for the year-ago quarter. The $21 million credit recorded in the fourth quarter represented the reversal of provision recorded in prior periods and resulted from management's decision to sell Key's indirect automobile loan portfolio.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $54 million, or 0.32% of average loans, compared with $140 million, or 0.83%, for the previous quarter and $111 million, or 0.71%, for the same period last year. Included in the $140 million of net charge-offs recorded for the fourth quarter of 2004 are net charge-offs of $84 million that related to the consumer loan portfolios that Key has exited or is in the process of exiting.
     During the first quarter of 2005, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $11 million to $305 million and represented 0.45% of period-end loans at March 31, 2005, compared with 0.46% at December 31, 2004, and 0.94% at March 31, 2004.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.128 billion, or 1.65% of loans outstanding at March 31, 2005, compared with $1.138 billion, or 1.66% at December 31, 2004, and $1.306 billion, or 2.09% at March 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses represented 370% of nonperforming loans, compared with 360% at December 31, 2004, and 222% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at March 31, 2005. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.44% at quarter end, compared with 6.35% at December 31, 2004, and 6.98% at March 31, 2004. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.

     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the first quarter of 2005, Key repurchased 2,500,000 of its common shares. At March 31, 2005, there were 26,961,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional Consumer Banking Data
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $131 million for the first quarter of 2005, up from $124 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses and growth in net interest income. The positive effects of these factors were offset in part by an increase in noninterest expense.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $22 million, or 36%, as a result of improved asset quality in both the Retail Banking and Small Business units within the Community Banking line of business, and management's 2004 decision to sell the broker-originated home equity and indirect automobile loan portfolios within the Consumer Finance line.
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2005 Earnings April 15, 2005 Page 5
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $11 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2004, due largely to growth in average core deposits and a more favorable interest rate spread on deposits.
     Noninterest income was essentially unchanged. The positive effects of a decrease in net losses incurred on the residual values of leased vehicles, along with increases in electronic banking fees, and income from dealer trading and derivatives, were offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts, and net gains from loan securitizations and sales. During the first quarter, a $19 million gain resulting from the sale of the prime indirect automobile loan portfolio was offset in part by a $9 million impairment charge taken in the education lending business.
     Noninterest expense rose by $21 million, or 5%, due primarily to higher costs associated with personnel, loan servicing, computer processing and various indirect charges.
Corporate and Investment Banking

Additional Corporate and Investment Banking Data
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2005 Earnings April 15, 2005 Page 6
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $148 million for the first quarter of 2005, up from $119 million for the same period last year. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income, along with a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $38 million, or 15%, from the first quarter of 2004, due primarily to strong growth in average loans and leases, and deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $7.0 billion, or 25%, reflecting improvements in each of the primary lines of business. The increase in lease financing receivables in the Key Equipment Finance line was bolstered by the acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Noninterest income rose by $9 million, or 6%, due largely to increases in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, and non-yield-related loan fees.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $15 million, or 75%, reflecting improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking and Key Equipment Finance lines of business.
     Noninterest expense rose by $15 million, or 8%, due primarily to an increase in personnel expense, reflecting expansion of the business and improved profitability.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $13 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $9 million for the same period last year.
