Item 8.01
Other Events
     McDonald Investments Inc. ("McDonald"), a registered broker-dealer subsidiary of KeyCorp, entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (the "AWC") with the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD"), which was accepted by the NASD's Office of Disciplinary Affairs on June 7, 2005. Under the terms of the AWC, McDonald agreed to accept a censure and pay a fine of $1,500,000 in connection with the resolution of an NASD inquiry regarding directed brokerage. In the AWC, McDonald consented, without admitting or denying the NASD's allegations, to the entry of findings that it had received directed brokerage commissions from mutual fund complexes whose shares were sold by McDonald as payment for participating in McDonald's Strategic Partner Program that gave such fund complexes increased access to McDonald's sales force and certain other benefits. The AWC also contained a finding that McDonald failed to comply with certain NASD recordkeeping requirements for mandated periods.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
