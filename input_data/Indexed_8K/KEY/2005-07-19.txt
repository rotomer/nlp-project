Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, July 19, 2005  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter net income of $291 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, compared with $239 million, or $0.58 per share, for the second quarter of 2004. For the first quarter of 2005, net income was $264 million, or $0.64 per diluted common share. For the first six months of 2005, net income was $555 million, or $1.34 per diluted common share, compared with $489 million, or $1.17 per share, for the first half of 2004.
     Return on average equity reached 16.15% for the second quarter of 2005, compared with 13.97% for the same period last year and 15.09% for the first quarter of 2005.
     "Key's solid second quarter results reflect continued improvement in the company's operating fundamentals and the positive effects of our longer-term strategic activities," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $72 million from the second quarter of last year, benefiting from a better net interest margin, substantial commercial loan growth and an increase in core deposits. Once again, we saw improvements in asset quality; nonperforming loans decreased for the 11consecutive quarter and net loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, remained at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 1995.
th
     "During the second quarter, we completed the sale of the nonprime segment of our indirect automobile loan portfolio and the integration of American Express Business Finance Corporation into Key Equipment Finance, our leasing line of business. These and other strategic actions we have taken to improve our business mix and credit risk profile clearly are contributing to our improving performance."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2005 and $2.60 to $2.70 per share for the full year.

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $723 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $714 million for the previous quarter and $651 million for the same period one year ago. This growth was attributable to a higher net interest margin, which improved to 3.71% from 3.66% for the previous quarter and 3.56% for the second quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2005, the net interest margin benefited from a principal investing distribution of $15 million received in the form of dividends and interest. This distribution added approximately 8 basis points to the net interest margin for the current quarter. Key's average earning assets for the second quarter of 2005 declined slightly from the prior quarter, due largely to the sale of the nonprime segment of the indirect automobile loan portfolio completed in April and the sale of the prime segment in March. Compared with the same period last year, average earning assets increased by 7%, due primarily to strong commercial loan growth.
     In light of recent changes in industry reporting practice, during the second quarter of 2005, Key reclassified its operating leases from "Loans" to "Accrued income and other assets" for all periods presented. The rental income and depreciation expense associated with these leases were similarly reclassified from "Net interest income" to "Other income" and to "Other expense," respectively. The reclassification of these leases, which have historically represented less than 1 percent of Key's total earning assets, had no effect on net income in any of the periods for which the reclassification was made.
     Key's noninterest income was $486 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $500 million for the first quarter. The decrease reflected a $15 million decline in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, due to a reduction in net gains from principal investing activities, and lower revenue from dealer trading and derivatives. During the first quarter, Key recorded $11 million of derivative income in connection with the anticipated sale of the indirect automobile loan portfolio. In addition, net gains from loan securitizations and sales declined by $9 million from the prior quarter. Included in Key's results for the first quarter of 2005 was a $19 million gain that resulted from the sale of the prime segment of the indirect automobile loan portfolio. These decreases were offset, in part, by growth in service charges on deposit accounts, higher letter of credit and loan fees, and net gains from the sales of securities, compared with net losses incurred for the prior quarter.
     Compared with the year-ago quarter, noninterest income decreased by $5 million, due largely to declines of $21 million in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, and $10 million in service charges on deposit accounts. These reductions were partially offset by increases in letter of credit and loan fees, and net gains from loan securitizations and sales.
     Key's noninterest expense was $753 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $769 million for the previous quarter. The reduction was due to a $30 million net occupancy charge recorded during the first quarter of 2005 to adjust the accounting for rental expense associated with operating leases from an escalating to a straight-line basis, and a $20 million contribution (included in miscellaneous expense) to the Key Foundation, also recorded during the first quarter, to fund future contributions. The overall reduction in noninterest expense was moderated by increases in marketing and a variety of other expense components.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2005 Earnings July 19, 2005 Page 3
     Compared with the second quarter of 2004, noninterest expense rose by $36 million, with the single largest factor being a $15 million increase in personnel expense.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $20 million for the second quarter of 2005, down from $44 million for the first quarter of 2005 and $74 million for the year-ago quarter.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $48 million, or 0.29% of average loans, compared with $54 million, or 0.32%, for the previous quarter and $104 million, or 0.67%, for the same period last year.
     During the second quarter of 2005, Key's nonperforming loans decreased by $12 million to $293 million and represented 0.43% of period-end loans at June 30, 2005, compared with 0.45% at March 31, 2005, and 0.72% at June 30, 2004.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.100 billion, or 1.62% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2005, compared with $1.128 billion, or 1.67% at March 31, 2005, and $1.276 billion, or 2.01% at June 30, 2004. At June 30, 2005, the allowance for loan losses represented 375% of nonperforming loans, compared with 370% at March 31, 2005, and 281% a year ago.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at June 30, 2005. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.60% at quarter end, compared with 6.43% at March 31, 2005, and 6.64% at June 30, 2004. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the second quarter of 2005, Key did not repurchase any of its common shares. At June 30, 2005, there were 26,961,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
     The following table shows the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue and net income for the periods presented. The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major business groups are described under the heading "Line of Business Descriptions." For more detailed financial information pertaining to each business group and its respective lines of business, see the last two pages of this release.
Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2005 Earnings July 19, 2005 Page 5
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $125 million for the second quarter of 2005, up from $104 million for the year-ago quarter. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income, along with a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $3 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2004, due to growth in, and a more favorable interest rate spread on, average deposits. The positive effects of these factors were moderated by a less favorable interest rate spread on earning assets and a decline in average loans, due largely to the sale of the higher-yielding broker-originated home equity and indirect automobile loan portfolios within the Consumer Finance line.
     Noninterest income increased by $13 million, or 6%, due primarily to net gains of $5 million from loan securitizations and sales in the current year, compared with net losses of $5 million in the year-ago quarter.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $27 million, or 55%, as a result of improved asset quality.
     Noninterest expense increased by $9 million, or 2%, due primarily to higher costs associated with loan servicing, reserves established to absorb potential noncredit-related losses from our education lending business, and various indirect charges. These adverse changes were partially offset by decreases in both personnel and net occupancy expenses.

Corporate and Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful, N/A = Not Applicable
 
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $157 million for the second quarter of 2005, up from $118 million for the same period last year. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income, along with a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses drove the improvement. These positive changes were offset, in part, by an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $61 million, or 26%, from the second quarter of 2004, due primarily to strong growth in average loans and leases, as well as deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $6.9 billion, or 25%, reflecting improvements in each of the primary lines of business. The increase in lease financing receivables in the Key Equipment Finance line was bolstered by the acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2005 Earnings July 19, 2005 Page 7
     Noninterest income rose by $9 million, or 4%, due largely to an increase in non-yield-related loan fees. This growth was moderated by a decrease in income from investment banking and capital markets activities.
     The provision for loan losses was a credit of $2 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with expense of $25 million for the year-ago quarter. The reduction from the second quarter of 2004 reflected improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking and KeyBank Real Estate Capital lines of business.
     Noninterest expense rose by $34 million, or 14%, as expansion of the business and improved profitability led to increases in personnel and various other expense categories. During the second quarter of 2005, we completed the integration of American Express Business Finance Corporation into Key Equipment Finance, our leasing line of business.
     In June 2005, we announced plans to further expand our FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, based in Dallas, Texas. This is one in a series of acquisitions that we have initiated over the past several years to build upon the success we have experienced in our commercial mortgage origination and servicing area.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $10 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $15 million for the same period last year. Declines in net gains from principal investing and the sales of securities drove the decrease.
