Item 8.01
Other Events
KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp, announced today that it has consented to the issuance of a consent order ("Order") from the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") pursuant to which KeyBank is required to improve its compliance and operations infrastructure designed to detect and prevent money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA"). At the same time, KeyCorp entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland ("FRB") covering compliance with the BSA and other related matters. Neither the OCC nor the FRB imposed a fine or civil money penalty in connection with these actions.
As part of the Order, KeyBank has agreed to strengthen its BSA internal controls, including the development and implementation of enhanced policies and procedures for BSA compliance; to enhance its programs and controls for Suspicious Activity Reporting; to enhance its BSA audit functions and its independent audit program; and to improve employee training relating to the detection and prevention of money laundering. KeyCorp and its KeyBank subsidiary have already taken significant steps to strengthen the organizations' compliance policies and procedures, and operations infrastructure in areas related to those specified in the Order and the MOU, as well as in other respects. Management is committed to ensuring that all of the requirements of these regulatory actions are met.
Management does not expect the actions to have a material impact on KeyBank's or KeyCorp's financial condition or results of operations. However, KeyBank has incurred additional expenses related to making the improvements necessary to strengthen its BSA operations and compliance, and expects that some increased expenses in connection with these regulatory actions may be incurred in the future. The actions may also have some impact on KeyCorp's ability to engage in certain acquisitions while the Order and MOU are outstanding.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, October 18, 2005  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced third quarter net income of $278 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share, compared with $252 million, or $0.61 per share, for the third quarter of 2004. For the second quarter of 2005, net income was $291 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share. For the first nine months of 2005, net income was $833 million, or $2.01 per diluted common share, compared with $741 million, or $1.78 per share, for the first nine months of 2004.
     "Key's third quarter performance reflects the company's ability to produce solid financial results in a more challenging interest rate environment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Taxable-equivalent revenue, which increased $102 million from the year-ago period, benefited from growth in net interest income and a stronger performance from our fee-based businesses. The increase in net interest income was driven by a 7 basis point improvement in the net interest margin to 3.67%, higher earning assets resulting from solid commercial loan growth, and an increase in core deposits. The improvement in fee income was due primarily to increases in loan fees, and income from principal investing and capital markets activities.
     "Both net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans were down from the same period last year, but nonperforming loans increased relative to the second quarter of 2005. The increase was attributable to Key's commercial passenger airline lease portfolio."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Separately, the company said that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRB), and KeyBank N.A. has entered into a consent order with the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) concerning compliance-related matters, particularly the Bank Secrecy Act. The company said it does not expect these actions to have a material effect on its operating results, adding that neither the OCC nor the FRB imposed a fine or civil money penalty in the matter. As part of the consent order and memorandum of
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2005 Earnings October 18, 2005 Page 2
understanding, Key has agreed to continue to strengthen its anti-money laundering and other compliance controls.
     "Key takes its regulatory obligations with the utmost seriousness," said Meyer, "and we are taking all necessary measures to meet the requirements of the consent order and memorandum of understanding."
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $726 million for the third quarter of 2005 from $673 million for the same period last year. Average earning assets rose by 6%, due primarily to commercial loan growth, while the net interest margin increased 7 basis points to 3.67%. Compared with the second quarter of 2005, taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $3 million. This growth was attributable to a $740 million increase in average earning assets, which more than offset the effect of a 4 basis point decline in the net interest margin. During the second quarter of 2005, Key's net interest margin benefited from a principal investing distribution of $15 million received in the form of dividends and interest. This distribution added approximately 8 basis points to the second quarter margin.
     Key's noninterest income was $531 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $482 million for the year-ago quarter. Increases of $34 million in income from principal investing and capital markets activities, and $8 million from letter of credit and loan fees drove the improvement.
     Compared with the second quarter of 2005, noninterest income grew by $45 million. The improvement reflected a $41 million increase in income from principal investing and capital markets activities. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts rose by $6 million from the prior quarter.
     Key's noninterest expense was $781 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $729 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense rose by $20 million and nonpersonnel expense increased by $32 million, reflecting higher costs associated with net occupancy, computer processing and a variety of other expense components.
     Compared with the second quarter of 2005, noninterest expense rose by $28 million. Personnel expense accounted for virtually all of the increase, with the largest increases occurring in incentive and stock-based compensation. Nonpersonnel expense was essentially unchanged. Higher costs associated with net occupancy and computer processing were offset by reductions in both marketing and miscellaneous expense. During the second quarter, miscellaneous expense included an $11 million charge to establish a reserve to absorb potential noncredit-related losses from Key's education lending business.

ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $43 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $51 million for the year-ago quarter and $20 million for the second quarter of 2005.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $49 million, or 0.30% of average loans, compared with $76 million, or 0.49%, for the same period last year and $48 million, or 0.30%, for the previous quarter.
     At September 30, 2005, Key's nonperforming loans stood at $360 million and represented 0.55% of period-end loans, compared with 0.63% at September 30, 2004, and 0.45% at June 30, 2005. The increase in the third quarter from June 30, 2005, was attributable to several carriers within the commercial passenger airline industry for which Key has provided lease financing.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $1.093 billion, or 1.67% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2005, compared with $1.251 billion, or 2.02% at September 30, 2004, and $1.100 billion, or 1.70% at June 30, 2005. At September 30, 2005, the allowance for loan losses represented 304% of nonperforming loans, compared with 322% a year ago and 377% at June 30, 2005.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2005. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.68% at quarter end, compared with 6.57% at September 30, 2004, and 6.60% at June 30, 2005. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the third quarter of 2005, Key repurchased 1,250,000 of its common shares. At September 30, 2005, there were 25,711,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Major Business Groups
N/M = Not Meaningful
Consumer Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2005 Earnings October 18, 2005 Page 5
Additional Consumer Banking Data
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $123 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $125 million for the year-ago quarter. A decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense caused the decline and more than offset growth in noninterest income and a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $9 million, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2004, due to a less favorable interest rate spread on average earning assets and a reduction in loans which resulted from the sale of the higher-yielding broker-originated home equity and indirect automobile loan portfolios within the Consumer Finance line of business. The adverse effects of these factors were moderated by growth in average deposits.
     Noninterest expense increased by $20 million, or 4%, due primarily to higher costs associated with marketing, loan servicing, recording and filing fees, and various indirect charges. The rise in these costs was partially offset by a decrease in fees for professional services.
     Noninterest income rose by $3 million, or 1%, due largely to increases in securitization servicing, insurance and electronic banking fees. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, and a decline in service charges on deposit accounts.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $23 million, or 44%, as a result of improved asset quality.

Corporate and Investment Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional Corporate and Investment Banking Data
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $147 million for the third quarter of 2005, up from $124 million for the same period last year. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income drove the improvement. These positive changes were offset, in part, by an increase in noninterest expense. In addition, Corporate and Investment Banking's provision for loan losses was an expense in the third quarter of 2005, compared with a credit in the year-ago quarter.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $61 million, or 26%, from the third quarter of 2004, due primarily to strong growth in average loans and leases, as well as deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $6.2 billion, or 22%, reflecting improvements in each of the primary lines of business. The increase in lease financing receivables in the Key Equipment Finance line was bolstered by the acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation ("AEBF") during the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2005 Earnings October 18, 2005 Page 7
     Noninterest income rose by $25 million, or 11%, due largely to increases in non-yield-related loan fees and income from capital markets activities.
     Noninterest expense rose by $34 million, or 13%, as business expansion, including the acquisition of AEBF, and improved profitability led to increases in personnel and various other expense categories.
     The provision for loan losses was an expense of $14 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with a credit of $1 million for the year-ago quarter.
     On July 1, 2005, we expanded our FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, based in Dallas, Texas. This is one in a series of acquisitions that we have made over the past several years to build upon our success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist primarily of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $21 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $4 million for the same period last year. Increases in net gains from principal investing and net interest income drove the improvement.
