Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     CLEVELAND, January 20, 2006  KeyCorp today announced fourth quarter net income of $296 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share, compared with $213 million, or $0.51 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. Adjusted net income for the year-ago quarter was $290 million, or $0.70 per share, excluding the effects of the sale of the broker-originated home equity loan portfolio and the reclassification of the indirect automobile loan portfolio to held-for-sale status. For the third quarter of 2005, net income was $278 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share. Return on average equity rose to 15.59% for the fourth quarter of 2005 from 11.99% for the same period last year and 14.84% for the third quarter of 2005.
     Key's 2005 net income of $1.129 billion, or $2.73 per diluted common share, was the highest in the company's history. Net income increased 18 percent from a reported $954 million, or $2.30 per share, for the previous year. Return on average equity rose to 15.42% for 2005 from 13.75% for 2004.
     "Key's solid fourth quarter results reflect our success in growing revenue, improving our business mix and strengthening our credit risk profile," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Compared with last year's comparable quarter, taxable-equivalent revenue rose by $132 million, reflecting an improved net interest margin, strong commercial loan growth, higher fee income and growth in core deposits  which increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2004. During the quarter, we also increased our commercial mortgage servicing portfolio from $44 billion to more than $70 billion through the acquisition of the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC.
     "Over the past several years, we have restored our strong credit culture, and we remain committed to maintaining it. Included in our net charge-offs for the quarter were $127 million of commercial passenger airline leases. Our exposure to that industry now stands at $86 million, substantially all of which is categorized as performing. Total nonperforming loans were down $31 million and total nonperforming assets declined by $72 million from December 31, 2004; both are at their lowest level in 11 years.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and Record 2005 Earnings January 20, 2006 Page 2
     "We are also committed to strengthening our anti-money laundering processes, and controls related to the Bank Secrecy Act. We believe we have made significant progress in this regard during the fourth quarter and will continue with our improvement efforts into 2006."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2006 and $2.80 to $2.90 per share for the full year.
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $748 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 from $698 million for the same period last year. Average earning assets rose by 4%, due primarily to commercial loan growth, while the net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 3.71%. The growth in commercial loans was attributable in part to the acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Compared with the third quarter of 2005, taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $22 million. This growth was attributable to a $1.4 billion increase in average earning assets and a 4 basis point improvement in the net interest margin.
     Key's noninterest income was $561 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $479 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable primarily to net gains from loan securitizations and sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with net losses recorded in the year-ago quarter. Current year results included a $16 million gain from the annual securitization and sale of education loans, while last year's results included $46 million of losses associated with management's decision to sell the broker-originated home equity and indirect automobile loan portfolios. Also contributing to the improved performance was a $15 million increase in income from principal investing.
     Compared with the third quarter of 2005, noninterest income grew by $30 million. The improvement reflected a $22 million increase in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, due largely to the gain resulting from the securitization and sale of education loans in the current period. Noninterest income also benefited from increases of $9 million in income from investment banking activities, $6 million in net gains on the residual values of leased equipment and $5 million in income from corporate owned life insurance. These increases were offset, in part, by an $11 million reduction in income from principal investing.
     Key's noninterest expense was $834 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $818 million for the same period last year. Excluding a $55 million write-off of goodwill recorded during the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with the decision to sell Key's nonprime indirect automobile loan business, noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 was up $71 million from the year-ago quarter. Nonpersonnel expense accounted for most of the growth. During the fourth quarter, miscellaneous expense included a $15 million contribution to the Key Foundation, a $10 million accrual for the settlement of a legal dispute and an additional $5 million reserve to absorb potential noncredit-related losses from Key's education lending business. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense were professional fees associated with Key's efforts to strengthen its compliance controls, higher franchise and business taxes, and an increase in net occupancy expense. Personnel expense rose by $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and Record 2005 Earnings January 20, 2006 Page 3
     Compared with the third quarter of 2005, noninterest expense increased by $53 million. Nonpersonnel expense grew by $51 million, reflecting the $15 million contribution to the Key Foundation, the legal settlement accrual, and increases in professional fees and a variety of other expense components. The level of personnel expense was essentially unchanged.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was an expense of $36 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with a credit of $21 million for the year-ago quarter and an expense of $43 million for the third quarter of 2005.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $164 million, or 0.98% of average loans, compared with $140 million, or 0.88%, for the same period last year and $49 million, or 0.30%, for the previous quarter. The increase from September 30, 2005, was attributable to the charge-off of several credits within the commercial passenger airline portfolio. Key had established reserves in prior periods in connection with these lease financing receivables.
     At December 31, 2005, Key's nonperforming loans stood at $277 million and represented 0.42% of period-end loans, compared with 0.49% at December 31, 2004, and 0.55% at September 30, 2005. The decrease from the prior quarter reflects charge-offs related to certain commercial passenger airline leases.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $966 million, or 1.45% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2005, compared with $1.138 billion, or 1.80% at December 31, 2004, and $1.093 billion, or 1.67% at September 30, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses represented 349% of nonperforming loans, compared with 369% a year ago and 304% at September 30, 2005.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2005. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.68% at quarter end, compared with 6.35% at December 31, 2004, and 6.68% at September 30, 2005. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Key repurchased 3,250,000 of its common shares. At December 31, 2005, there were 22,461,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and Record 2005 Earnings January 20, 2006 Page 5
     Net income for Consumer Banking was $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $59 million for the year-ago quarter. Two principal causes of the increase were the fourth quarter 2004 sale of the broker-originated home equity loan portfolio, and the reclassification of the indirect automobile loan portfolio to held-for-sale status. These actions significantly reduced noninterest income and the provision for loan losses, and substantially increased noninterest expense in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the effects of the above actions, net income for Consumer Banking was $136 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $13 million, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2004, due to a less favorable interest rate spread on average earning assets and a reduction in loans which resulted from the sale of the higher-yielding broker-originated home equity and indirect automobile loan portfolios. The adverse effects of these factors were moderated by growth in average deposits.
     Noninterest income rose by $52 million, or 28%, due primarily to net gains from loan securitizations and sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with net losses recorded in the year-ago quarter. Current year results included a $16 million gain from the annual securitization and sale of education loans, while last year's results included $46 million of losses associated with management's decision to sell the previously-mentioned portfolios. Noninterest income also benefited from higher income from electronic banking and loan securitization servicing. The positive effects of these factors were offset, in part, by decreases in income from brokerage, and various investment banking and capital markets activities.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $28 million, or 5%, due primarily to a $55 million write-down of goodwill recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with management's decision to sell the nonprime indirect automobile loan business, and a decrease in personnel expense. The overall reduction in noninterest expense was moderated by higher costs associated with loan servicing and various indirect charges.

Corporate and Investment Banking
 
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful, N/A = Not Applicable
 
     Net income for Corporate and Investment Banking was $161 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, down from $174 million for the same period last year. A significant increase in the provision for loan losses and growth in noninterest expense more than offset increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.
     The provision for loan losses was an expense of $8 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with a credit of $30 million for the year-ago quarter. The credit recorded last year was due largely to improved asset quality in the Corporate Banking and KeyBank Real Estate Capital lines of business.
     Noninterest expense rose by $46 million, or 17%, as business expansion, including the acquisition of American Express Business Finance Corporation ("AEBF"), contributed to increases in personnel and various other expense categories.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $55 million, or 21%, due primarily to strong growth in average loans and leases, as well as deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $5.6 billion, or 18%, reflecting improvements in each of the primary lines of business. The increase in lease financing receivables in the Key Equipment Finance line was bolstered by the acquisition of AEBF during the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and Record 2005 Earnings January 20, 2006 Page 7
     Noninterest income grew by $7 million, or 3%. The improvement was driven by net securities gains in the current year, compared with net losses recorded one year ago, higher income from operating leases and an increase in net gains on the residual values of leased equipment. The positive effects of these factors were partially offset by a reduction in income from investment banking activities.
     On December 8, 2005, we continued the expansion of our commercial mortgage servicing business by acquiring the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC. This is one in a series of acquisitions that we have made over the past several years to build upon our success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $9 million for the same period last year. Increases in net gains from principal investing and net interest income drove the improvement.
