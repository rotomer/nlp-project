Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, April 18, 2006  KeyCorp today announced first quarter net income of $289 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, compared with $264 million, or $0.64 per share, for the first quarter of 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2005, net income was $296 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share. Return on average equity was 15.48% for the first quarter of 2006, compared with 15.09% for the same period last year and 15.59% for the fourth quarter of 2005.
     "Key's first quarter results reflect continued strength in the bank's business fundamentals," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Compared with last year's first quarter, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $42 million, reflecting a better net interest margin, solid commercial loan growth and an increase in core deposits. Asset quality also remained solid. The level of our nonperforming loans was down slightly from the year-ago quarter, and net loan charge-offs represented 0.23 percent of average total loans.
     "We recently announced that Beth Mooney, a highly respected industry executive, will be joining the company as vice chair and leader of our Community Bank. In addition, on April 1, we completed the acquisition of Austin Capital Management, which broadened our asset management product line. These actions demonstrate our continuing commitment to build the strong management team required to succeed in an intensely competitive market and to expand our product offerings."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2006 and $2.80 to $2.90 per share for the full year.
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $756 million for the first quarter of 2006 from $714 million for the same period last year. Average earning assets rose by 3% as a result of commercial loan growth, and the net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 3.77%. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $8 million. This growth was attributable to an increase in average earning assets and a 6 basis point improvement in the net interest margin. During the first quarter of 2006, net interest income benefited from the call of certain securitization trusts, which added approximately 3 basis points to the margin.
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2006 Earnings April 18, 2006 Page 2
     Key's noninterest income was $481 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with $500 million for the year-ago quarter. Last year's first quarter results benefited from income related to the sale of the indirect automobile loan portfolio, including a $19 million gain recorded in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, and $11 million of derivative income recorded in investment banking and capital markets revenue. In addition, Key recorded net losses of $3 million from principal investing in the current year, compared with net gains of $12 million one year ago. The reduction in noninterest income caused by these factors was substantially offset by a $25 million gain recorded in investment banking and capital markets revenue that resulted from the initial public offering completed by the New York Stock Exchange in March 2006. The gain represents the difference between the value of shares and other consideration received, and the carrying amount of the exchange seats owned by Key.
     Compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, noninterest income decreased by $80 million, due primarily to declines of $24 million in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, $19 million in principal investing results, $9 million in letter of credit and loan fees, and $15 million in miscellaneous income, due to a variety of items. The decrease in noninterest income is attributable in part to normal seasonal fluctuations.
     Key's noninterest expense was $770 million for the first quarter of 2006, essentially unchanged from the level reported one year ago. Personnel expense rose by $15 million, due to additional costs incurred in connection with business expansion, and an increase in employee benefits expense. Nonpersonnel expense was down $14 million, reflecting a $28 million decrease in net occupancy expense and a $20 million reduction in charitable contributions included in miscellaneous expense. The favorable effects of these factors were substantially offset by increases in computer processing expense, professional fees, and a variety of miscellaneous expense components. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2005 included an $11 million credit to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments.
     Compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, noninterest expense decreased by $64 million. Personnel expense declined by $11 million, due primarily to lower incentive compensation accruals, offset in part by an increase in costs associated with employee benefits. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $53 million as a result of reductions in marketing expense, professional fees, net occupancy expense and charitable contributions.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
     Effective January 1, 2006, Key adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R changes the manner in which forfeited share-based awards must be accounted for. Under the new standard, companies are no longer permitted to account for forfeitures as they occur. Those, such as Key, that have been expensing share-based awards and using this alternative method of accounting must now estimate expected forfeitures at the date the awards are granted and record compensation expense only for those that are expected to vest. As of the effective date, companies must estimate the forfeitures they expect to occur and reduce their related compensation obligation for expense previously recognized in the financial statements. The after-tax amount of this reduction must also be presented on the income statement as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Key's cumulative after-tax adjustment increased first quarter 2006 earnings by $5 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share.

ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $39 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with $44 million for the year-ago quarter and $36 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $39 million, or 0.23% of average loans, compared with $54 million, or 0.34%, for the same period last year and $164 million, or 0.98%, for the previous quarter. Included in net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $127 million of commercial passenger airline leases.
     At March 31, 2006, Key's nonperforming loans stood at $295 million and represented 0.44% of period-end loans, compared with 0.47% at March 31, 2005, and 0.42% at December 31, 2005.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $966 million, or 1.44% of loans outstanding at March 31, 2006, compared with $1.128 billion, or 1.76%, at March 31, 2005, and $966 million, or 1.45%, at December 31, 2005. At March 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses represented 327% of nonperforming loans, compared with 377% a year ago and 349% at December 31, 2005.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at March 31, 2006. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.71% at quarter end, compared with 6.43% at March 31, 2005, and 6.68% at December 31, 2005. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the first quarter of 2006, Key repurchased 6,000,000 of its common shares. At March 31, 2006, there were 16,461,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Major Business Groups
Community Banking
 
KeyCorp Reports First Quarter 2006 Earnings April 18, 2006 Page 5
Additional Community Banking Data
     Net income for Community Banking was $108 million for the first quarter of 2006, up from $89 million for the year-ago quarter. An increase in net interest income and lower noninterest expense drove the improvement. Both noninterest income and the provision for loan losses were essentially unchanged.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $19 million, or 5%, from the first quarter of 2005, due to growth in average deposits and commercial loans. The positive effects of these factors were moderated by tighter interest rate spreads on average earning assets and deposits.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $13 million, or 3%. Higher costs associated with personnel, marketing and computer processing were more than offset by reductions in various indirect charges.

National Banking
Additional National Banking Data
     Net income for National Banking was $177 million for the first quarter of 2006, up from $168 million for the same period last year. Increases in both net interest income and noninterest income, along with a decrease in the provision for loan losses, drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $20 million, or 6%, reflecting strong growth in average loans and leases, as well as deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $3.1 billion, or 8%, with most of the growth coming from the Real Estate Capital line of business. Net interest income also benefited from the call of certain securitization trusts during the first quarter of 2006.
     Noninterest income increased by $13 million, or 6%, due primarily to higher income from investment banking and capital markets activities.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $6 million, or 38%, as a result of an improved credit risk profile.
     Noninterest expense rose by $26 million, or 8%, reflecting higher costs associated with personnel and a $9 million credit to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments recorded during the year-ago quarter.

     Since the first quarter of 2005, we have completed two acquisitions that have helped us to build upon our success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we continued the expansion of our commercial mortgage servicing business by acquiring the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the third quarter, we expanded our FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, also based in Dallas.

These segments generated net income of $1 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with $13 million for the same period last year.
