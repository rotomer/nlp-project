On June 20, 2006, in connection with the closing of the Capital Securities offering, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the "RCC"), whereby the Company agreed for the benefit of certain of its debtholders named therein that it would not cause the redemption or repurchase of the Capital Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures unless such repurchases or redemptions are made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the RCC.

Exhibit 1.1
EXECUTION COPY
June 13, 2006
To the Representatives of the several Underwriters
    named in Schedule I to the respective
    Pricing Agreements hereinafter described
Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time KeyCorp Capital VIII, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the Designated Trust), and KeyCorp, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), as depositor of the Designated Trust and as guarantor, propose to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, that the Designated Trust issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its preferred securities (the "Securities") representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Designated Trust. The Securities specified in such Pricing Agreement are referred to as the "Firm Designated Securities" with respect to such Pricing Agreement. If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Designated Trust may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Securities, specified as provided in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and any Optional Designated Securities are collectively called the "Designated Securities." The proceeds of the sale of the Designated Securities to the public and of common securities of the Designated Trust (the "Common Securities") to the Company concurrently with the sale of the Designated Securities are to be invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures") identified in the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Junior Subordinated Debentures"), to be issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 4, 1996, between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), as supplemented from time to time (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). The Designated Securities may be exchangeable into Designated Junior Subordinated Debentures, as specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement. The Designated Securities will be guaranteed by the Company to the extent set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities (the "Designated Guarantee") (all such Designated Guarantees together, the "Guarantees").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the amended and restated trust agreement identified in such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Trust Agreement").
1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Designated Trust to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Designated Trust to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities, the maximum number of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated Securities, including the terms on which and terms of the securities into which the Designated Securities will be exchangeable, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm and Optional Designated Securities, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The standard provisions set forth herein will be incorporated by reference in any Pricing Agreement. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

8. (a) The Designated Trust and the Company, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that neither the Designated Trust nor the Company shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Designated Trust and the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Designated Trust and the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Designated Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Designated Trust and the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Designated Trust and the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Designated Trust in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve it from
 
any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other hand from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Designated Trust and the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Designated Trust, the Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be
 
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Designated Trust and the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Designated Trust and the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Designated Trust and the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Designated Trust and the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Designated Trust shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Designated Trust that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Designated Trust notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Designated Trust shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Designated Trust agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Designated Trust shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Designated Trust shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or the Over-allotment Option relating to such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Designated Trust or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Designated Trust and the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

11. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, neither the Designated Trust nor the Company shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Designated Trust or the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Designated Trust or the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Designated Trust or the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Designated Trust or

13. The Company and the Designated Trust each acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and Junior Subordinated Debentures pursuant to this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Designated Trust, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Designated Trust, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Designated Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Designated Trust on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or the Designated Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement and (iv) the Company and the Designated Trust (if applicable) has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company and the Designated Trust each agree that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Designated Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Designated Trust, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the trustees, officers and directors of the Designated Trust, the Company and each person who controls any Designated Trust or the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

KEYCORP, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Property Trustee of KEYCORP CAPITAL VIII, or registered assigns, the principal sum of                      dollars ($             ) on June 15, 2066. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from June 20, 2006 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2006, at the rate of 7% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum, compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month period and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Property Trustee or the principal offices of the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement hereinafter referred to for KEYCORP CAPITAL VIII, is closed for business. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this
 
 
Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be (i) the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, or (ii) the fifteenth (15) day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is not issued in the form of a Global Security. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more full provided in said Indenture.
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for up to twenty consecutive quarterly interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extension Period"), but shall (subject to its rights to further defer interest on Interest Payment Dates during an APM Period as described in the Indenture) pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law, compounded quarterly at the rate specified in this Security) on the first Interest Payment Date following the termination of such Extension Period; , that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security. Upon termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period except on the first Interest Payment Date thereafter.
provided, however
The Company also shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of this Security, to defer payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date during an APM Period (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, if the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an MDE Certification (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to such Interest Payment Date as described in the Indenture, that the Company may not so defer interest on or after the maturity date of, or redemption date for, this Security, or if such deferral would result in the Company having failed to pay accrued interest in full on more than forty (40) consecutive Interest Payment Dates. On any Interest Payment Date during an APM Period, the Company covenants not to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on this Security except on an Interest Payment Date and except in an aggregate amount for each Interest Payment Date that does not exceed the Eligible Equity Proceeds (as defined in the Indenture) raised by the Company as described in the Indenture.

Book-Entry Capital Securities.
As provided in Section 5.2(b), Capital Securities, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of Global Capital Securities Certificates representing Book-Entry Capital Securities, to be delivered to DTC or its nominee by, or on behalf of, the Issuer Trust.

(c) If any Global Capital Securities Certificate is to be exchanged for other Capital Securities Certificates or cancelled in part, or if another Capital Securities Certificate is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in any Global Capital Securities Certificate, then either (i) such Global Capital Securities Certificate shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation as provided in this Article Five or (ii) the aggregate Liquidation Amount represented by such Global Capital Securities Certificate shall be reduced, subject to Section 5.2, or increased by an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount represented by that portion of the Global Capital Securities Certificate to be so exchanged or cancelled, or equal to the Liquidation Amount represented by such other Capital Securities Certificates to be so exchanged for Global Capital Securities represented thereby, as the case may be, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Securities Registrar, whereupon the Property Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, shall instruct the Clearing Agency or its authorized representative to make a corresponding adjustment to its records. Upon surrender to the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar of the Global Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, shall execute the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency.

Upon the issuance of Definitive Capital Securities Certificates, the Issuer Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates as Holders. The Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them.
(d) Every Capital Securities Certificate executed and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Capital Securities Certificate or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Article Five or Article Four or otherwise, shall be executed and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Capital Securities Certificate, unless such Capital Securities Certificate is registered in the name of a Person other than the Clearing Agency for such Global Capital Securities Certificate or a nominee thereof.
(e) The Clearing Agency or its nominee, as registered owner of a Global Capital Securities Certificate, shall be the Holder of such Global Capital Securities Certificate for all purposes under this Trust Agreement and the Global Capital Securities Certificate, and Owners with respect to a Global Capital Securities Certificate shall hold such interests pursuant to the Applicable Procedures. The Securities Registrar and the Issuer Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Trust Agreement relating to the Book-Entry Capital Securities (including the payment of the Liquidation Amount of and Distributions on the Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities and the giving of instructions or directions to Owners of Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities) as the sole Holder of Capital Securities evidenced by the Book-Entry Capital Securities and shall have no obligations to the Owners thereof. Neither the Property Trustee nor the Securities Registrar shall have any liability in respect of any transfers effected by the Clearing Agency.
The rights of the Owners of the Book-Entry Capital Securities shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law, the Applicable Procedures and
 
agreements between such Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Certificate Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 5.4(b), the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments on the Capital Securities to such Clearing Agency Participants, and none of the Depositor or the Issuer Trustees shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect thereto.

Upon receipt by the Securities Registrar of such Capital Securities Certificate as provided in Section 5.5(a) and instructions satisfactory to the Securities Registrar directing that a specified number of Capital Securities to be represented by the Global Capital Securities Certificate not greater than the number of Capital Securities represented by such Capital Securities Certificate be credited to a specified Clearing Agency Participant's account and then the Securities Registrar shall cancel such Capital Securities Certificate (and issue a new Capital Securities Certificate in respect of any untransferred portion thereof) as provided in Section 5.5(a) and increase the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Global Capital Securities Certificate by the Liquidation Amount represented by such Capital Securities so transferred as provided in Section 5.4(c).

Any purchaser or Holder of any Capital Securities or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding thereof that either (i) it is not a Plan and no part of the assets to be used by it to purchase and/or hold such Capital Securities or any interest therein constitutes "plan assets" of any Plan, or (ii) it is itself a Plan or is purchasing or holding the Capital Securities or an interest therein on behalf of or with "Plan Assets" of
PTCE
 
one or more Plans, and each such purchase and holding of such securities either (A) satisfies the requirements of, and is entitled to full exemptive relief under, PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 (or some other applicable class or individual exemption) (or, in the case of a non-ERISA Plan, a similar exemption applicable to the transaction) or (B) will not result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or its equivalent under applicable similar laws.

In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time.
SECTION 5.7.
Persons Deemed Holders.
The Issuer Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Issuer Trustees nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.

The Paying Agents shall initially be the Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Bank, and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee. In the event that the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). Such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities other than as set forth in the next preceding sentence shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating substantially "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 5.11 OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT.

SECTION 5.13.
Rights of Holders.
(a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust
 
Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement.

(b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default under Section 5.1(a)(1) of the Indenture, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee with a copy to the Property Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount of and the accrued interest on all of the Debentures shall become immediately due and payable, provided that if such a Debenture Event of Default results from the failure to pay interest on the Debentures on or by the next interest payment date following a five-year Extension Period, the Holders may not declare such principal amount of the Debentures due and payable and may not institute a Direct Action (as defined below) for the enforcement of payment of principal on the Debentures prior to the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of such Extension Period. Any payment of principal and interest on such Debentures as described herein shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in the Indenture.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)) on all of the Debentures,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and
(C) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been
 
deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Capital Securities all or part of which is represented by Book-Entry Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).
(c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(a)(1), 5.1(b)(2) or 5.1(b)(3) of the Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or interest on Debentures having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a ""), provided that if such a Debenture Event of Default results from the failure to pay interest on the Debentures on or by the next interest payment date following a five-year Extension Period, the Holders may not declare such principal amount of the Debentures due and payable and may not institute a Direct Action for the enforcement of payment of principal on the Debentures prior to the expiration of ten consecutive years after the commencement of such Extension Period.

(b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Issuer Trust, the Property Trustee shall not (i) direct the time, method or place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Property Trustee with respect to such Debentures, (ii) waive any past default which is waivable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due

The Issuer Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received from the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustee shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
provided, however,

A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.

SECTION 8.1.
Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Article. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee from liability for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct with respect to acts or omissions. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee has duties and liabilities relating thereto to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees.
(b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
(c) If a Trust Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders.
(d) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
 
(iii) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
(iv) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law; and
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor.
(e) The Administrative Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Administrative Trustee, the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor.
SECTION 8.2.
Certain Notices.
Within five Business Days after the occurrence of any Trust Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Trust Event of Default to the Holders, the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor, unless such Trust Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
SECTION 8.3.
Certain Rights of Property Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1:

(g) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; that, nothing contained in this Section 8.3(g) shall be taken to relieve the Property Trustee, upon the occurrence of a Trust Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement;
provided
(h) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit;

(k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement;
(l) when the Property Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with a Bankruptcy Event, such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law or law relating to creditors rights generally; and
(m) the Property Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of a Trust Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Property Trustee receives written notice of such event from Holders holding more than a majority of Capital Securities (based upon Liquidation Amount).
No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which any Issuer Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation.

Relevant Trustee
Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, a Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Issuer Trust, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
Unless a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Issuer Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holder of the Common Securities. If a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at such time by Act of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). An Administrative Trustee may be removed by the Holder of the Common Securities at any time. In no event will the Holders of the Capital Securities have a right to vote to appoint, remove or replace the Administrative Trustees.
If any Issuer Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Issuer Trustee for any reason, at a time when no Debenture
 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holder of the Common Securities, by Act, shall promptly appoint a successor Issuer Trustee or Issuer Trustees, and the retiring Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11, except that a successor Administrative Trustee need not comply with Section 8.11. If the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by Act of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If an Administrative Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Administrative Trustee, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holder of the Common Securities, by Act, shall promptly appoint a successor Administrative Trustee or Trustees. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holder of the Common Securities or the Holders of the Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11 if applicable, any Holder who has been a Holder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Administrative Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holder of Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by appointment by the remaining Administrative Trustees.
SECTION 8.11.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, other than the appointment of a successor Administrative Trustee pursuant to Section 8.19(a), the retiring Relevant Trustee (if requested by the Depositor) and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Issuer Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on request of the Issuer Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust.
Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Issuer Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
 
No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
SECTION 8.12.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
SECTION 8.13.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or the Issuer Trust.
If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any other obligor upon the Capital Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any such other obligor).
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Issuer Trust or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer Trust for the payment of any past due Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Property Trustee and, in the event the Property Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Property Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Property Trustee.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Property Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement adjustment or compensation affecting the Trust Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Property Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
