Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, July 18, 2006  KeyCorp today announced second quarter net income of $308 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share, compared to $291 million, or $0.70 per share, for the second quarter of 2005. For the first quarter of 2006, net income was $289 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share. Return on average equity was 16.11% for the second quarter of 2006, compared to 16.15% for the same period last year and 15.48% for the first quarter of 2006.
     For the first six months of 2006, net income was $597 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, compared to $555 million, or $1.34 per share, for the first six months of 2005. Return on average equity was 15.80%, compared to 15.63% for the first half of 2005.
     "Key's improved performance in the second quarter was driven by revenue growth and solid asset quality," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Relative to last year's second quarter, Key's taxable-equivalent revenue rose by $90 million. This increase was due largely to solid commercial loan growth, higher income from our fee-based businesses and growth in core deposits, which increased 10% from the second quarter of 2005. The growth in fee income was broad-based and included increases in trust and investment services income, investment banking fees, income from operating leases, and net gains from both principal investing and the initial public offering by MasterCard.
     "With regard to asset quality, both nonperforming loans and net loan charge-offs were down from both the prior and year-ago quarters. For the second quarter of 2006, net loan charge-offs represented 0.21% of Key's average total loans."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter of 2006 and $2.85 to $2.95 per share for the full year.
SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased to $752 million for the second quarter of 2006 from $723 million for the same period last year. The positive effect of a 4% increase in average earning assets, due primarily to commercial loan growth, more than offset the effect of a 2 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 3.69%. During the second quarter of 2005, the net interest margin benefited from a principal investing distribution of $15 million received in the

July 18, 2006
Page 2
form of dividends and interest. This distribution added approximately 8 basis points to the net interest margin for the year-ago quarter.
     Compared to the first quarter of 2006, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $4 million. This reduction was attributable to an 8 basis point decline in the net interest margin, offset in part by a slight increase in average earning assets.
     Key's noninterest income was $547 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to $486 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected net gains of $23 million from principal investing in the current year, compared to net losses of $1 million one year ago, and a $9 million gain recorded in miscellaneous income that resulted from the share redemption by MasterCard Incorporated as part of its initial public offering in May 2006. Also contributing to the improved performance were increases in income from trust and investment services, investment banking activities, insurance products and operating leases.
     Compared to the first quarter of 2006, noninterest income grew by $66 million, due to a $26 million increase in principal investing results and broad-based improvement in fee income resulting from increased business activities. Key's noninterest income for the second quarter of 2006 included the $9 million gain associated with the MasterCard initial public offering, and results for the prior quarter included a $25 million gain recorded in investment banking and capital markets revenue that resulted from the initial public offering completed by the New York Stock Exchange in March.
     Key's noninterest expense was $816 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to $753 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense rose by $45 million, due to additional costs incurred in connection with business expansion, an increase in employee benefits expense and higher incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense increased by $18 million. This increase included a $10 million rise in professional fees, due largely to additional expenses associated with Key's efforts to strengthen its compliance controls.
     Compared to the first quarter of 2006, noninterest expense increased by $46 million. Personnel expense rose by $26 million, due primarily to higher incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense grew by $20 million, reflecting increases in marketing expense and professional fees.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $24 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to $20 million for the year-ago quarter and $39 million for the first quarter of 2006.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $34 million, or 0.21% of average loans, compared to $48 million, or 0.30%, for the same period last year and $39 million, or 0.23%, for the previous quarter.
     At June 30, 2006, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $279 million and represented 0.41% of period-end loans, compared to 0.45% at June 30, 2005, and 0.44% at March 31, 2006.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $956 million, or 1.42% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2006, compared to $1.100 billion, or 1.70%, at June 30, 2005, and $966 million, or 1.44%, at March 31, 2006. At June 30, 2006, the allowance for loan losses represented 343% of nonperforming loans, compared to 377% a year ago and 327% at March 31, 2006.

CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at June 30, 2006. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.68% at quarter end, compared to 6.60% at June 30, 2005, and 6.71% at March 31, 2006. The ratio is currently within management's targeted range of 6.25% to 6.75%.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the second quarter of 2006, Key repurchased 4,000,000 of its common shares. At June 30, 2006, there were 12,461,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Community Banking
 
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional Community Banking Data
     Net income for Community Banking was $105 million for the second quarter of 2006, down from $118 million for the year-ago quarter. An increase in noninterest expense drove the decline and more than offset growth in net interest income. Noninterest income and the provision for loan losses were essentially unchanged.
     Noninterest expense grew by $37 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005, due primarily to a rise in personnel expense and increases in various indirect charges.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $16 million, or 4%, due to growth in average core deposits, which also experienced a more favorable interest rate spread. The positive effect of these factors was offset in part by a tighter interest rate spread on average earning assets.

National Banking
 
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable
Additional National Banking Data
     Net income for National Banking was $175 million for the second quarter of 2006, up from $160 million for the same period last year. Growth in both net interest income and noninterest income more than offset increases in noninterest expense and the provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $26 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005, reflecting strong growth in average loans and leases, as well as deposits. Average loans and leases rose by $3.4 billion, or 9%, with most of the growth coming from the Real Estate Capital line of business. The positive effect of these factors was moderated by a tighter interest rate spread on average earning assets in the Consumer Finance line of business.
     Noninterest income rose by $20 million, or 8%. Contributing to the improved performance were increases in income from trust and investment services, investment banking activities and operating leases.
     Noninterest expense increased by $19 million, or 6%, reflecting higher costs associated with personnel and various indirect charges.
     Since the second quarter of 2005, we have completed two acquisitions that have helped us to build upon our success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we continued the expansion of our commercial mortgage servicing business by acquiring the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the third quarter, we expanded our FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, also based in Dallas.
