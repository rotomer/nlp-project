Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, October 17, 2006  KeyCorp today announced third quarter net income of $312 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share, compared to $278 million, or $0.67 per share, for the third quarter of 2005. For the second quarter of 2006, net income was $308 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share. Return on average equity was 15.88% for the third quarter of 2006, compared to 14.84% for the same period last year and 16.11% for the second quarter of 2006.
     For the first nine months of 2006, net income was $909 million, or $2.21 per diluted common share, compared to $833 million, or $2.01 per share, for the first nine months of 2005. Return on average equity was 15.82%, compared to 15.36% for the same period last year.
     "Key's financial performance continued to improve in the third quarter, driven once again by revenue growth and solid asset quality trends," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Key's taxable-equivalent revenue rose by $37 million from the year-ago quarter due to solid commercial loan growth, an increase in core deposits and higher fee income. These improved results were achieved in a challenging interest rate environment and a highly competitive market for loans and deposits.
     "With regard to asset quality, nonperforming assets decreased by $64 million from the third quarter of 2005. Net loan charge-offs were down $6 million and represented 0.25% of Key's average total loans for the current quarter.
     "During the third quarter, we reached an agreement to sell our McDonald Investments branch network to UBS Financial Services and separately announced our intention to pursue the sale of the Champion Mortgage finance business. These actions will improve Key's business mix and support our focus on relationship businesses."
     The company expects earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006.

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $751 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared to $726 million for the year-ago quarter. The positive effect of a 5% increase in average earning assets, due primarily to a 7% rise in commercial loans, more than offset the effect of a 4 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 3.63%. Competitive pressure on loan and deposit pricing and the flat-to-inverted yield curve are expected to continue to put pressure on margins.
     Compared to the second quarter of 2006, taxable-equivalent net interest income was essentially unchanged. The favorable effect of an increase in average earning assets was offset by the effect of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin.
     Key's noninterest income was $543 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared to $531 million for the year-ago quarter. The improvement reflected higher income from several of Key's fee-based businesses, offset in part by reductions in income from dealer trading and derivatives, and other investments. In addition, Key recorded net losses from the sales of securities, compared to net gains in the same period one year ago.
     Compared to the second quarter of 2006, noninterest income decreased by $4 million. Lower income from investment banking and capital markets activities was the primary cause of the decline. In addition, Key recorded net losses from the sales of securities in the third quarter of 2006, compared to net gains in the prior quarter. These results were moderated by increases in income from a number of other fee-based businesses.
     Key's noninterest expense was $808 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared to $781 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense rose by $8 million, due primarily to higher costs incurred in connection with business expansion. Nonpersonnel expense grew by $19 million, which included a $10 million contribution made to Key Foundation during the third quarter of 2006.
     Compared to the second quarter of 2006, noninterest expense decreased by $8 million. The improvement was attributable to decreases in personnel expense, professional fees and miscellaneous expense, offset in part by higher costs associated with marketing and the contribution to Key Foundation.

ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $31 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared to $43 million for the year-ago quarter and $24 million for the second quarter of 2006.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $43 million, or 0.25% of average loans, compared to $49 million, or 0.30%, for the same period last year and $34 million, or 0.21%, for the previous quarter.
     At September 30, 2006, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $223 million and represented 0.34% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 0.55% at September 30, 2005, and 0.41% at June 30, 2006. During the third quarter of 2006, Key moved approximately $55 million of loans from "nonperforming loans" to "nonperforming loans held for sale" in connection with its intention to pursue the sale of the Champion Mortgage finance business. This reclassification had no effect on Key's total nonperforming assets. At September 30, 2006, nonperforming assets totaled $329 million and represented 0.50% of portfolio loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, compared to 0.60% at September 30, 2005, and 0.46% at June 30, 2006.
     Key's allowance for loan losses stood at $944 million, or 1.44% of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2006, compared to $1.093 billion, or 1.67%, at September 30, 2005, and $956 million, or 1.42%, at June 30, 2006. At September 30, 2006, the allowance for loan losses represented 423% of nonperforming loans, compared to 304% one year ago and 343% at June 30, 2006.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2006. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.81% at quarter end, compared to 6.68% at September 30, 2005, and June 30, 2006.
     Key's capital position provides it with the flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities, to repurchase shares when appropriate and to pay dividends. During the third quarter of 2006, Key repurchased 2,500,000 of its common shares. At September 30, 2006, there were 9,961,248 shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization. Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Major Business Groups
 
Community Banking
 
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2006 Earnings October 17, 2006 Page 5
Additional Community Banking Data
     Net income for Community Banking was $112 million for the third quarter of 2006, up slightly from $111 million for the year-ago quarter. Growth in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses drove the improvement and more than offset an increase in noninterest expense. Noninterest income was essentially unchanged.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $11 million, or 3%, from the third quarter of 2005, due to growth in average deposits, which also experienced a more favorable interest rate spread. The positive effects of these factors were moderated by a reduction in, and a tighter interest rate spread on, earning assets.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $4 million, or 15%, as a result of an improved credit risk profile.
     Noninterest expense rose by $15 million, or 3%. Increases in personnel expense and various indirect charges caused the rise.
     During the third quarter of 2006, Key entered into an agreement to sell the McDonald Investments branch network to UBS Financial Services Inc., a subsidiary of UBS AG. This network includes approximately 340 financial advisors in addition to the field support staff who work in 14 states throughout the Northeast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Northwest. The sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007.
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2006 Earnings October 17, 2006 Page 6
National Banking
     Net income for National Banking was $176 million for the third quarter of 2006, up from $161 million for the same period last year. The improvement was due primarily to higher net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses, offset in part by a rise in the level of noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $27 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2005, reflecting strong growth in deposits, as well as average loans and leases. Deposits rose by $3.3 billion, or 42%, from the third quarter of 2005. Average loans and leases grew by $1.7 billion, or 5%, due largely to increases in the Real Estate Capital and Equipment Finance lines of business. The positive effects of these factors were moderated by tighter interest rate spreads on average earning assets in the Equipment Finance and Consumer Finance lines.
     Noninterest income rose by $3 million, or 1%. Higher income from operating leases, trust and investment services, and a number of other fee-based services were moderated by reductions in income from dealer trading and derivatives, and other investments. In addition, Key recorded net losses from the sales of securities, compared to net gains in the same period one year ago.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $8 million, or 47%, as a result of an improved credit risk profile.
     Noninterest expense increased by $14 million, or 4%, reflecting higher costs associated with operating leases and various indirect charges.

     In the current year, we have continued to take actions to improve our business mix and to support our focus on relationship businesses. During the third quarter, we announced our plans to pursue the sale of the Champion Mortgage finance business, and during the prior quarter, we expanded our asset management product line by acquiring Austin Capital Management, Ltd., an investment firm headquartered in Austin, Texas.
     In addition, during the second half of 2005, we completed two acquisitions that have helped us to build upon our success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we continued the expansion of our commercial mortgage servicing business by acquiring the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the third quarter, we expanded our FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, also based in Dallas.
