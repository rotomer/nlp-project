Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     CLEVELAND, January 19, 2007  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $311 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations of $284 million, or $0.69 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005, and $305 million, or $0.74 per share, for the third quarter of 2006. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Key's income from continuing operations for 2006 was $1.193 billion, or $2.91 per diluted common share, compared to $1.090 billion, or $2.63 per share, in 2005.
     Key sold the nonprime mortgage loan portfolio held by its Champion Mortgage finance business in November 2006 and announced that it had entered into a separate agreement to sell Champion's origination platform. The platform sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007. As a result of these actions, Key has applied discontinued operations accounting to this business for all periods presented in this release.
     Net income totaled $146 million, or $0.36 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to net income of $296 million, or $0.72 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005, and $312 million, or $0.76 per share, for the third quarter of 2006. Key's net income for 2006 was $1.055 billion, or $2.57 per diluted common share, compared to $1.129 billion, or $2.73 per share, in 2005.
     The following table shows Key's continuing and discontinued operating results for comparative quarters and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

     "Key's positive results reflect the strategic actions we have taken over the past several years to improve the company's business mix," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Our decisions in 2006 to sell the Champion Mortgage finance business and the McDonald Investments branch network exemplify our disciplined focus on our core relationship-oriented businesses. These actions, along with our commitment to maintaining a strong credit culture and strengthening our compliance controls, have positioned the company well as we move into 2007. We remain on track to sell the McDonald branch network and the Champion origination platform during the first quarter."
     The company expects full year 2007 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.10 per share.
SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $744 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $716 million for the year-ago quarter. Average earning assets grew by 4%, due primarily to a 5% increase in commercial loans. The net interest margin was 3.66%, compared to 3.68% for the same period one year ago. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Key's net interest margin benefited from a $16 million lease accounting adjustment resulting from a change in effective state tax rates, and an $8 million principal investing distribution received in the form of a dividend. These two items added approximately 12 basis points to the taxable-equivalent net interest margin for the current quarter.
     Compared to the third quarter of 2006, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $18 million. The improvement was due to the lease accounting adjustment and the principal investing distribution recorded during the fourth quarter.
     Key's noninterest income was $558 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $552 million for the year-ago quarter. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2006 included two offsetting items: a $24 million charge to miscellaneous income recorded in connection with the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, and a $25 million gain from the annual securitization and sale of education loans. Key experienced strong performance from its fee-based businesses in the fourth quarter, including investment banking and capital markets activities. Fee income from principal investing activities was down $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2005. However, in the current period, the Principal Investing unit received $8 million in the form of a dividend included in net interest income.
     Compared to the third quarter of 2006, noninterest income grew by $15 million. The company experienced higher fee income from several fee-based businesses, including investment banking and capital markets activities. Net gains from principal investing decreased from the third quarter.
     Key's noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $809 million, down from $812 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense rose by $36 million from the year-ago quarter, due to higher costs associated with business expansion, employee benefits and variable compensation associated with the improvement in Key's fee-based businesses. Nonpersonnel expense was down $39 million, primarily due to a $9 million decrease in professional fees and a $16 million decrease in franchise and business tax expense, due to settlements of disputed amounts during the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, miscellaneous expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 included a $15 million contribution to Key Foundation.
     Compared to the third quarter of 2006, noninterest expense rose by $19 million, due primarily to increases in personnel expense, professional fees and net occupancy expense. These costs were offset in part by lower franchise taxes and marketing expense. In addition, miscellaneous expense for the third quarter of 2006 included a $10 million contribution to Key Foundation.

ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses from continuing operations was $53 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $35 million for the year-ago quarter and the third quarter of 2006.
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $54 million, or 0.33% of average loans from continuing operations, compared to $164 million, or 1.02%, for the same period last year and $43 million, or 0.26%, for the previous quarter. The fourth quarter of 2005 included net charge-offs of $127 million related to commercial passenger airline leases.
     At December 31, 2006, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $215 million and represented 0.33% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 0.42% at December 31, 2005, and 0.34% at September 30, 2006. At December 31, 2006, nonperforming assets totaled $273 million and represented 0.41% of portfolio loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2005, and 0.50% at September 30, 2006.
     Key's allowance for loan losses was $944 million, or 1.43% of loans outstanding, at December 31, 2006, compared to $966 million, or 1.45%, at December 31, 2005, and $944 million, or 1.44%, at September 30, 2006.
CAPITAL
     Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2006. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.01% at quarter end, compared to 6.68% at December 31, 2005, and 6.81% at September 30, 2006.
     Key repurchased 5.0 million of its common shares and reissued 1.4 million shares under employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans during the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year, Key repurchased 17.5 million shares and reissued 10.0 million shares. Key has 30.0 million common shares remaining for repurchase under the new authorization approved by the Board of Directors yesterday.
     Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.
Summary of Changes in Common Shares Outstanding
     Effective December 31, 2006, Key adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," which requires an employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status, respectively, of its defined benefit plans. As a result of adopting this guidance, Key recorded an after-tax charge of $149 million to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders' equity during the fourth quarter.

Additional Community Banking Data
Community Banking Summary of Operations
     Net income for Community Banking was $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up from $95 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense accounted for the improvement, and more than offset a slight decline in net interest income. Noninterest income was essentially unchanged.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2005. Net interest income benefited from growth in average deposits, which also experienced a more favorable interest rate spread. However, the positive effects of these factors were offset by a reduction in, and a tighter interest rate spread on, earning assets.
     The provision for loan losses decreased by $7 million, or 23%, as a result of lower net charge-offs.
     Noninterest expense decreased by $4 million, or 1%. Reductions in various indirect charges caused the improvement, but were offset in part by increases in personnel and marketing expense.
     During the third quarter of 2006, Key entered into an agreement to sell the McDonald Investments branch network to UBS Financial Services Inc., a subsidiary of UBS AG. This network includes approximately 340 financial advisors in addition to the field support staff who work in 14 states throughout the Northeast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Northwest. The sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007.

National Banking
 
National Banking Summary of Continuing Operations
     Income from continuing operations for National Banking was $194 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up from $164 million for the same period last year. The improvement was attributable to growth in net interest income and noninterest income, offset in part by a higher provision for loan losses and an increase in noninterest expense.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $31 million, or 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting strong growth in deposits, as well as average loans and leases. Deposits rose by $3.3 billion, or 38%, from the fourth quarter of 2005. Average loans and leases grew by $2.8 billion, or 8%, reflecting growth in all major lines of business. In addition, the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2006 benefited from a $16 million lease accounting adjustment resulting from a change in effective state tax rates. The positive effects of the above factors were moderated by tighter interest rate spreads on average earning assets in the Consumer Finance and Equipment Leasing lines of business.
     Noninterest income rose by $49 million, or 18%. Higher income from investment banking and capital markets activities, operating leases, trust and investment services, and net gains from loan securitizations and sales drove the improvement.
     The provision for loan losses rose by $25 million, with most of the increase recorded in the Real Estate Capital and Equipment Finance lines of business.
     Noninterest expense grew by $7 million, or 2%, reflecting increases in personnel expense and costs associated with operating leases. These increases were partially offset by decreases in various indirect charges.

     In the current year, Key has continued to take actions to improve its business mix and to support its focus on relationship businesses. These actions include the November 2006 sale of the nonprime mortgage loan portfolio held by the Champion Mortgage finance business, and the sale of Champion's origination platform, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007. As a result of these actions, Key has applied discontinued operations accounting to this business. Further information with regard to the composition of the fourth quarter 2006 loss from Champion discontinued operations presented in the preceding table is presented on the first page of this release.
     In 2006, Key expanded its asset management product line by acquiring Austin Capital Management, Ltd., an investment firm headquartered in Austin, Texas.
     During the second half of 2005, Key completed two acquisitions that have helped to build upon success in commercial mortgage origination and servicing. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Key continued the expansion of its commercial mortgage servicing business by acquiring the commercial mortgage-backed servicing business of ORIX Capital Markets, LLC, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the third quarter, Key expanded its FHA financing and servicing capabilities by acquiring Malone Mortgage Company, also based in Dallas.
Other Segments
     Other segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $19 million for the same period last year. A decrease in net gains from principal investing and a $24 million charge recorded in the current quarter in connection with the redemption of certain trust preferred securities caused the decrease.
