Other Events
Key has previously reported on its on-going litigation with Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation ("Swiss Re") in the United States Federal District Court in Ohio relating to insurance coverage of the residual value of certain automobile leases through Key Bank USA (the "Residual Value Litigation").
On February 13, 2007, Key and Swiss Re entered into an agreement to settle the Residual Value Litigation, subject to certain conditions. On February 16, 2007, the conditions to settlement were satisfied. Under the settlement agreement, Swiss Re will pay Key $279 million in two installments: $50 million on March 15, 2007, and $229 million on June 29, 2007. As a result of the settlement, Key will record a one-time gain of approximately $26 million ($17 million after tax, or $.04 per diluted common share), representing the difference between the proceeds received and the receivable recorded on Key's balance sheet.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
