Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          CLEVELAND, July 17, 2007  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter income from continuing operations of $337 million, or $0.85 per diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations of $303 million, or $0.74 per share, for the second quarter of 2006, and $358 million, or $0.89 per share, for the first quarter of 2007. Key's income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2007 was $695 million, or $1.74 per diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  of $577 million, or $1.40 per share, for the first half of 2006.
          Net income totaled $334 million, or $0.84 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2007, compared to net income of $308 million, or $0.75 per share, for the second quarter of 2006 and $350 million, or $0.87 per share, for the first quarter of 2007. Key's net income for the first half of 2007 was $684 million, or $1.71 per diluted common share, compared to $597 million, or $1.45 per share, for the same period last year.
          The following table shows Key's continuing and discontinued operating results for comparative quarters and for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.
Results of Operations
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2007 Earnings July 17, 2007 Page 2
          As shown below, the comparability of Key's income from continuing operations for comparative quarters is affected by several significant items, including the McDonald Investments branch network sold in February 2007.
Significant Items Affecting the Comparability of Earnings
          "We are extremely pleased with the company's results in light of continued competitive pressures experienced in a challenging interest rate environment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Growth in noninterest income and effective expense control drove Key's strong second quarter results. Noninterest income rose by $104 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by the favorable performance of several of our fee-based businesses. Principal investing gains were $90 million during the current quarter, which was up $67 million from the year-ago period. While we don't expect this level of principal investing gains to repeat in the second half of 2007, we expect to see strength in several of our fee-based businesses, and our overall outlook for the remainder of the year is positive.
          "Beyond our financial performance for the quarter, as we previously reported, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland have removed the regulatory agreements. I am extremely appreciative of the commitment and level of effort put forth by our employees, and of the support provided by our Board of Directors as we strengthened our Anti-money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs."
          The company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60 for the second half of 2007.

SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $706 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $726 million for the year-ago quarter. Average earning assets grew by $2.6 billion, or 3%, while the net interest margin for the current quarter declined to 3.46% from 3.68% for the second quarter of 2006. The reduction in the net interest margin was due primarily to tighter interest rate spreads on both loans and deposits, reflecting the continuation of competitive pricing, and a shift from NOW and money market deposit accounts to higher-cost certificates of deposit. Additionally, as part of the February 2007 sale of the McDonald Investments branch network, Key transferred approximately $1.3 billion of NOW and money market deposit accounts to the buyer. McDonald Investments' NOW and money market deposit accounts averaged $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2006.
          Compared to the first quarter of 2007, taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $6 million, and the net interest margin declined by 4 basis points. The improvement in net interest income was attributable to a $1.4 billion, or annualized 7%, increase in average earning assets.
Key's noninterest income was $649 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $545 million for the year-ago quarter. The strong growth reflected increases of $67 million in net gains from principal investing, $23 million in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, and higher revenue from several other fee-based businesses. In addition, results for the current quarter include a $40 million gain related to the sale of MasterCard Incorporated shares, compared to a $9 million gain recorded in the year-ago quarter that resulted from the share redemption by MasterCard Incorporated as part of its initial public offering. Trust and investment services income decreased due to lower brokerage income resulting from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network. The company experienced increases in both personal and institutional asset management income.
          Compared to the first quarter of 2007, noninterest income declined by $5 million. The company's first quarter results included a $171 million gain from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network and $19 million of fee income from the operation of that network. During the same quarter, Key recorded a $49 million loss in connection with the repositioning of the securities portfolio and a $26 million gain from the settlement of the automobile residual value insurance litigation.
          Key's noninterest expense was $815 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $798 million for the same period last year. Included in results for the current quarter is a $42 million charge related to litigation. Personnel expense decreased by $16 million, due to lower incentive compensation accruals stemming from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network. Excluding the litigation reserve, nonpersonnel expense was down $9 million, due primarily to reductions in professional fees and certain other costs associated with the McDonald Investments branch network.
          Compared to the first quarter of 2007, noninterest expense increased by $31 million as the litigation charge recorded in the second quarter more than offset reductions in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense associated with the McDonald Investments branch network. Additionally, Key recorded a $6 million provision for losses on lending-related commitments in the second quarter, compared to an $8 million credit in the first quarter.

ASSET QUALITY
          Key's provision for loan losses from continuing operations was $53 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $23 million for the year-ago quarter and $44 million for the first quarter of 2007.
          Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $53 million, or 0.32% of average loans from continuing operations, compared to $34 million, or 0.22%, for the same period last year and $44 million, or 0.27%, for the previous quarter.
          At June 30, 2007, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $276 million and represented 0.41% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 0.39% at March 31, 2007, and 0.41% at June 30, 2006. At June 30, 2007, nonperforming assets totaled $378 million and represented 0.57% of portfolio loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, compared to 0.54% at March 31, 2007, and 0.46% at June 30, 2006.
          Key's allowance for loan losses was $945 million, or 1.42% of loans outstanding, at June 30, 2007, compared to $944 million, or 1.44%, at March 31, 2007, and $956 million, or 1.42%, at June 30, 2006.
CAPITAL
          Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at June 30, 2007. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.89% at quarter end, compared to 6.97% at March 31, 2007, and 6.68% at June 30, 2006.
          Key repurchased 6.0 million of its common shares and reissued .9 million shares under employee benefit plans during the second quarter of 2007. At June 30, 2007, Key had 16.0 million common shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization.
          Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Additional Community Banking Data
Community Banking Summary of Operations
          Net income for Community Banking was $97 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $100 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in both net interest income and noninterest income were offset in part by a decline in noninterest expense. The provision for loan losses was essentially unchanged.
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $16 million, or 4%, from the second quarter of 2006. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in, and a tighter interest rate spread on, average earning assets, along with a shift from NOW and money market deposit accounts to higher-cost certificates of deposit. Also, as part of the February 2007 sale of the McDonald Investments branch network, Key transferred approximately $1.3 billion of NOW and money market deposit accounts to the buyer. McDonald's NOW and money market deposit accounts averaged $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2006.
          Noninterest income decreased by $32 million, or 14%, from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to a reduction in brokerage income caused by the McDonald Investments sale. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts.
          Noninterest expense declined by $43 million, or 9%. Lower personnel costs and decreases in certain other costs associated with the McDonald Investments branch network accounted for most of the improvement.

National Banking
National Banking Summary of Continuing Operations
          Income from continuing operations for National Banking was $169 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $176 million for the same period last year. Increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense accounted for the reduction, and more than offset an increase in noninterest income. Net interest income was essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter.
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by less than $1 million from the second quarter of 2006. The adverse effect of a tighter interest rate spread on average earning assets was offset by the growth in average loans and deposits.
          The provision for loan losses rose by $30 million, reflecting a higher level of net loan charge-offs.
          Noninterest income was up $35 million, or 14%. The growth was attributable to a significant increase in net gains from loan securitizations and sales, along with higher income from operating leases, and trust and investment services.
          Noninterest expense grew by $15 million, or 5%, due primarily to higher costs associated with operating leases.
Other Segments
          Other segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $49 million for the second quarter of 2007, up from $19 million for the same period last year.
