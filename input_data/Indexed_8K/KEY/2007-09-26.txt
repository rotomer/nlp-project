Item 5.02
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On September 20, 2007, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of KeyCorp approved an amendment to each of the KeyCorp Second Supplemental Retirement Plan, the KeyCorp Second Executive Supplemental Pension Plan, the KeyCorp Second Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan, the KeyCorp Deferred Savings Plan, the KeyCorp Automatic Deferral Plan, and the KeyCorp Deferred Bonus Plan, effective January 1, 2008. The amendment will permit Plan participants who commence disability benefits under the KeyCorp Long Term Disability Plan and whose employment with Key is terminated in conjunction with their commencement of disability benefits under the Long Term Disability Plan to become fully vested in their benefit under the Plan effective as of their termination date from Key.
     It is anticipated that the KeyCorp Second Supplemental Retirement Plan, the KeyCorp Second Executive Supplemental Pension Plan, the KeyCorp Second Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan, the KeyCorp Deferred Savings Plan, the KeyCorp Automatic Deferral Plan, and the KeyCorp Deferred Bonus Plan will be amended by December 31, 2007 to reflect the foregoing change and will be filed following completion of all amendments.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
