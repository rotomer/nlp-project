Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND, October 16, 2007  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced third quarter income from continuing operations of $224 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations of $305 million, or $0.74 per share, for the third quarter of 2006, and $337 million, or $0.85 per share, for the second quarter of 2007. Key's income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 was $919 million, or $2.31 per diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  of $882 million, or $2.15 per share, for the first nine months of 2006.
Net income totaled $210 million, or $0.54 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2007, compared to net income of $312 million, or $0.76 per share, for the third quarter of 2006 and $334 million, or $0.84 per share, for the second quarter of 2007. Key's net income for the first nine months of 2007 was $894 million, or $2.25 per diluted common share, compared to $909 million, or $2.21 per share, for the same period last year.
Key's continuing and discontinued operating results for comparative quarters and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented in the following table.
Results of Operations
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2007 Earnings October 16, 2007 Page 2
During the third quarter of 2007, the fixed income markets experienced extraordinary volatility with credit spreads widening rapidly. The widening of these spreads had a direct impact on market values in Key's loans held-for-sale and trading portfolios. During the third quarter, Key recorded net losses of $53 million from loan sales and write-downs, $2 million from dealer trading and derivatives, and $22 million from other investments for a total of $77 million in net losses. This compares to net gains of $26 million and $51 million from these activities in the third quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2007, respectively.
"The fixed income market volatility had an adverse impact on our third quarter results," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "While the fixed income markets continue to remain under some pressure as we head into the fourth quarter, we believe most of the financial impact on our held-for-sale portfolios is behind us and we expect to see improved results from these portfolios over the remainder of the year.
"Business activity outside of the fixed income markets remained solid during the quarter. We experienced good growth in both loans and core deposits. We also saw growth in our institutional asset management business and related fee income. Given the challenges related to revenue associated with the fixed income markets, we focused on controlling our costs, which declined compared to the same period one year ago and the second quarter of this year.
"Key's nonperforming assets rose by $241 million from the third quarter of 2006. The increase was due primarily to deteriorating market conditions in the residential real estate segment of our Real Estate Capital line of business, principally in Florida and California. Our total net loan charge-offs were $59 million or 0.35% of average total loans for the current quarter.
"During the quarter, we made progress in expanding our franchise through targeted acquisitions. We announced our plans to acquire U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, headquartered in Orangeburg, New York, and Tuition Management Systems, Inc., one of the leading providers of education-related financial services. We completed the acquisition of Tuition Management Systems on October 1 and we remain on track to complete the acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Company early in 2008, subject to approval by its shareholders and the banking regulators."
The company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.74 for the fourth quarter of 2007.
SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $712 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $726 million for the year-ago quarter. Average earning assets grew by $3.6 billion, or 4%, while the net interest margin for the current quarter declined to 3.40% from 3.61% for the third quarter of 2006. Both loan and deposit spreads have remained under pressure due to the continuation of competitive pricing.
 
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2007 Earnings October 16, 2007 Page 3
Compared to the second quarter of 2007, taxable-equivalent net interest income grew by $6 million, and the net interest margin declined by 6 basis points. The improvement in net interest income was attributable to a $1.9 billion, or annualized 9%, increase in average earning assets.
Key's noninterest income was $438 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $543 million for the year-ago quarter. The decrease was attributable to the impact of market volatility on several of Key's capital markets-driven businesses, as well as the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network completed in the first quarter of this year. Results for the current quarter included $53 million in net losses from the sales and write-downs of primarily commercial real estate loans held for sale, compared to net gains of $14 million for the same period last year. Income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased by $35 million, due primarily to a $25 million decline in the fair values of two real estate-related investments held by the Private Equity unit within the Real Estate Capital line of business. Net gains from principal investing declined by $19 million from the third quarter of 2006. Trust and investment services income was down $18 million, due to lower brokerage income resulting from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network. Excluding the impact of the McDonald Investments sale, trust and investment services income increased by $15 million, driven by growth in both personal and institutional asset management income. The reduction in noninterest income was moderated by a $27 million gain from the sale of MasterCard Incorporated shares in the current quarter and growth in deposit service charge income.
Compared to the second quarter of 2007, noninterest income declined by $211 million. The reduction reflected $53 million in net losses from loan sales and write-downs in the current quarter, compared to net gains of $33 million for the prior quarter, an $81 million reduction in net gains from principal investing and a $43 million decrease in income from investment banking and capital markets activities. The decrease in income from investment banking and capital markets activities was attributable to declines in the fair values of the two real estate-related investments, as well as a loss from dealer trading and derivatives in the current quarter, compared to income in the second quarter. In addition, noninterest income for the current quarter included the $27 million gain related to the sale of MasterCard Incorporated shares, compared to a $40 million gain recorded in the prior quarter.
Key's noninterest expense was $753 million for the third quarter of 2007, down from $790 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense decreased by $35 million, due to lower incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense was down $2 million from the year-ago quarter. Reductions in costs resulting from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network accounted for a $46 million decline in total noninterest expense, including $27 million of the decrease in personnel expense.
Compared to the second quarter of 2007, noninterest expense decreased by $62 million. The improvement included a $28 million reduction in personnel expense due to lower incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $34 million. In the second quarter of 2007, Key recorded a $42 million charge related to litigation.

ASSET QUALITY
Key's provision for loan losses from continuing operations was $69 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $35 million for the year-ago quarter and $53 million for the second quarter of 2007.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $59 million, or 0.35% of average loans from continuing operations, compared to $43 million, or 0.26%, for the same period last year and $53 million, or 0.32%, for the previous quarter.
At September 30, 2007, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $498 million and represented 0.72% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 0.41% at June 30, 2007, and 0.34% at September 30, 2006. At September 30, 2007, nonperforming assets totaled $570 million and represented 0.83% of portfolio loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, compared to 0.57% at June 30, 2007, and 0.50% at September 30, 2006. The increase in nonperforming assets during the third quarter of 2007 was attributable primarily to deteriorating market conditions in the residential real estate segment of Key's commercial real estate construction portfolio. The majority of the increase in this segment came from loans outstanding in Florida and California.
Key's allowance for loan losses was $955 million, or 1.38% of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2007, compared to $945 million, or 1.42%, at June 30, 2007, and $944 million, or 1.44%, at September 30, 2006.
CAPITAL
Key's capital ratios continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2007. Key's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.78% at quarter end, compared to 6.89% at June 30, 2007, and 6.81% at September 30, 2006.
Key repurchased 2.0 million of its common shares and reissued 1.3 million shares under employee benefit plans during the third quarter of 2007. At September 30, 2007, Key had 14.0 million common shares remaining for repurchase under the current authorization.
Share repurchases and other activities that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the table below.

Additional Community Banking Data
Community Banking Summary of Operations
Net income for Community Banking was $131 million for the third quarter of 2007, up from $112 million for the year-ago quarter. Declines in both net interest income and noninterest income were more than offset by decreases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $34 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2006, as interest rate spreads on both average earning assets and deposits have remained under pressure due to the continuation of competitive pricing. The decrease also reflected the effect of the February 2007 sale of the McDonald Investments branch network in which Key transferred approximately $1.3 billion of NOW and money market deposit accounts to the buyer. McDonald Investments' NOW and money market deposit accounts averaged $1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2006.
Noninterest income decreased by $27 million, or 11%. The decrease was attributable to the McDonald Investments sale. Excluding the impact of this sale, noninterest income rose by $13 million, or 6%, from the same period one year ago, due largely to growth in deposit service charge income.
The provision for loan losses decreased by $21 million, compared to the third quarter of 2006.
Noninterest expense declined by $69 million, or 14%, from the year-ago quarter. Reductions in costs resulting from the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network accounted for $46 million of the decline, including a $27 million decrease in personnel expense. The remainder of the decline in total noninterest expense reflected decreases in various direct and indirect charges, due in part to a reduction in the number of average full-time equivalent employees.
On July 27, 2007, Key entered into an agreement to acquire U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, a state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Orangeburg, New York, with 31 branches. U.S.B. Holding Company has assets of approximately $3 billion and deposits of approximately $2 billion. Key expects to complete this acquisition early in 2008, subject to approval by U.S.B. Holding Company shareholders and the banking regulators. The acquisition will expand Key's presence in markets both within and contiguous to its current operations in the Hudson Valley.

National Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful, N/A = Not Applicable
National Banking Summary of Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for National Banking was $72 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $169 million for the same period last year. Lower noninterest income along with increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense accounted for the reduction, and more than offset an increase in net interest income.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $11 million, or 3%, from the third quarter of 2006. Increases in average earning assets and deposits, and a more favorable interest rate spread on deposits more than offset the adverse effect of a tighter interest rate spread on average earning assets.
Noninterest income declined by $86 million, or 36%, as several capital markets-driven businesses were adversely affected by volatility in the financial markets. Results for the current quarter included net losses of $57 million from the sales and write-downs of primarily commercial real estate loans held for sale, compared to net gains of $10 million for the year-ago quarter. Income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased by $39 million, due primarily to a $25 million decline in the fair values of two real estate-related investments held by the Private Equity unit within the Real Estate Capital line of business, and less favorable results related to trading activities conducted in the Debt Capital markets area.
The provision for loan losses rose by $55 million, reflecting increases in nonperforming loans in the Real Estate Capital and Consumer Finance lines of business.
Noninterest expense grew by $24 million, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a $12 million rise in costs associated with operating leases, and smaller increases in a variety of other expense components.
On October 1, 2007, Key acquired Tuition Management Systems, Inc., one of the nation's largest providers of outsourced tuition planning, billing and related technology services. Headquartered in Warwick, Rhode Island, Tuition Management Systems serves more than 700

colleges, universities, elementary and secondary educational institutions. The payment plan systems and technology in place at Tuition Management Systems and the array of payment plan products offered by Key will create one of the largest, most robust payment plan offerings in the nation.
Other Segments
Other segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $16 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $20 million for the same period last year. A reduction in net gains from principal investing caused the decrease.
