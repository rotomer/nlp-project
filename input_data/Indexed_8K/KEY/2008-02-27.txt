February 20, 2008
To the Representatives of the several Underwriters
      named in Schedule I to the respective
      Pricing Agreements hereinafter described
Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time KeyCorp Capital X, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Designated Trust"), and KeyCorp, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), as depositor of the Designated Trust and as guarantor, propose to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, that the Designated Trust issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its preferred securities (the "Securities") representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Designated Trust. The Securities specified in such Pricing Agreement are referred to as the "Firm Designated Securities" with respect to such Pricing Agreement. If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Designated Trust may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Securities, specified as provided in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and any Optional Designated Securities are collectively called the "Designated Securities." The proceeds of the sale of the Designated Securities to the public and of common securities of the Designated Trust (the "Common Securities") to the Company concurrently with the sale of the Designated Securities are to be invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures") identified in the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Junior Subordinated Debentures"), to be issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 4, 1996, between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), as supplemented from time to time (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"). The Designated Securities may be exchangeable into Designated Junior Subordinated Debentures, as specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement. The Designated Securities will be guaranteed by the Company to the extent set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities (the "Designated Guarantee") (all such Designated Guarantees together, the "Guarantees").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the amended and restated trust agreement identified in such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Trust Agreement").
1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Designated Trust to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Designated Trust to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities, the maximum number of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated Securities, including the terms on which and terms of the securities into which the Designated Securities will be exchangeable, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm and Optional Designated Securities, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The standard provisions set forth herein will be incorporated by reference in any Pricing Agreement. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Designated Trust and the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Designated Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Designated Trust and the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Designated Trust and the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Designated Trust in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 8. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
 
relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other hand from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Designated Trust and the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Designated Trust and the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Designated Trust, the Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Designated Trust and the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Designated Trust and the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Designated Trust and the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Designated Trust and the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Designated Trust
 
shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Designated Trust that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Designated Trust notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Designated Trust shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Designated Trust agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Designated Trust shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Designated Trust shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or the Over-allotment Option relating to such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Designated Trust or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Designated Trust and the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Designated Trust or the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of
 
any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Designated Trust or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Designated Trust or the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
11. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, neither the Designated Trust nor the Company shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Designated Trust or the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Designated Trust or the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Designated Trust or the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Designated Trust or the Company, respectively, set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Designated Trust and the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
13. The Company and the Designated Trust each acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and Junior Subordinated Debentures pursuant to this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Designated Trust, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Designated Trust, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Designated Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Designated Trust on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or the Designated Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement and (iv) the Company and the Designated Trust (if applicable) has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company and the Designated Trust each agree that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Designated Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Designated Trust, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the trustees, officers and directors of the Designated Trust, the Company and each person who controls any Designated Trust or the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof.

Payment of Deferred Interest
(i) Commencing on the earlier of (A) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (B) the date of any payment of current interest on the Debentures during an
 
Optional Deferral Period, if any Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall continuously use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect sales of Qualifying APM Securities in an amount that will generate sufficient net Eligible Equity Proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Debentures then outstanding. Notwithstanding (and as a qualification to) the foregoing or any other provision of this Supplemental Indenture, (x) the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of Qualifying APM Securities during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event, (y) the Company will be permitted to pay Deferred Interest using cash from any source upon the occurrence of a Supervisory Event as provided for in paragraph (v) of Section 2.1(g) and (z) the Company shall not pay interest on the Debentures at a time when such payment would violate a specific prohibition against payment of interest contained in the terms of any Parity Securities or securities ranking senior to the Debentures upon a liquidation of the Company. The Company's obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying APM Securities to pay all Deferred Interest on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exits or is continuing.
(ii) The Company is not permitted to sell Common Stock, Qualified Warrants on Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock such that the Common Stock to be issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof) would be in excess of the "Maximum Share Number," determined pursuant to this sub-paragraph (ii), for the purpose of satisfying the Company's obligations under Section 2.1(h)(i) or otherwise paying Deferred Interest on the Debentures then outstanding.

If the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Maximum Share Number shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Company shall increase the Maximum Share Number (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) to an amount that would allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest in full at the end of the first year of an Optional Deferral Period (and on each subsequent anniversary of the end of the first year of an Optional Deferral Period to the extent that an Optional Deferral Period would last more than one year), if the then-current Maximum Share Number would not allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest at such time assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of the Company's common stock over the ten-trading-day period preceding such date; , , that the Company will not be obligated to increase the Maximum Share Number above 265 million shares. Until the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, a default will occur if the Company does not increase the Maximum Share Number to an amount that is greater than 110 million shares when required to do so as described above, that no default will occur if the Company has increased the Maximum Share Number to 265 million shares.

In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of Qualifying APM Securities following the earlier of (x) such Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (y) the date of any payment of current interest during an Optional Deferral Period are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of Deferred Interest, such net proceeds will be paid to the holders of the Debentures on a basis; , , that, if the Company has outstanding at such time any Parity Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated (I) to sell Qualifying APM Securities and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon) or (II) to apply the proceeds of any Qualifying APM Securities to payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon), then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales of Qualifying APM Securities and available for payment of Deferred Interest shall be applied to the Debentures and such Parity Securities on a basis, taking into account any net proceeds from the sales of securities other than Qualifying APM Securities that would be permitted to be applied to the payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon) on any such Parity Securities but not on the Debentures.

The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from February 27, 2008 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2008, at the rate of 8.000% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum, compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month period and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.

This is one of the Securities referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.
Dated: February 27, 2008
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 4, 1996, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 13, 2005, a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2005, a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 20, 2006, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 21, 2006, and a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 27, 2008 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Supplemental Indentures referenced above, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $805,010,000 issuable on one or more occasions.
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of February 27, 2008 (the "Trust Agreement"), for KEYCORP CAPITAL X, among KeyCorp, as Sponsor, and the Trustees named therein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Trust Agreement, as the case may be.
The Company may at any time, at its option, on or after March 15, 2013, and subject to the terms and conditions of Article XI of the Indenture and Section 2.1(l) of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, and subject to prior approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if then required, redeem this Security in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without premium or penalty, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Tax Event, Investment Company Event or a Regulatory Capital Event in respect of the Trust, the Company may, at its option, at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of such Tax Event, Investment Company Event or Regulatory Capital Event redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, subject to the provisions of Article XI of the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Rating Agency Event, the Company may, at its option, at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of such Rating Agency Event redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, subject to the provisions of Article XI of the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the Make-whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
Commencing on the earlier of (A) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (B) the date of any payment of current interest on the Debentures during an Optional Deferral Period, if any
 
Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall continuously use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect sales of Qualifying APM Securities in an amount that will generate sufficient net Eligible Equity Proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Debentures then outstanding. Notwithstanding (and as a qualification to) the foregoing or any other provision of this Supplemental Indenture, (x) the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of Qualifying APM Securities during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event, (y) the Company will be permitted to pay Deferred Interest using cash from any source upon the occurrence of a Supervisory Event as provided for in paragraph (v) of Section 2.1(g) of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture and (z) the Company shall not pay interest on the Debentures at a time when such payment would violate a specific prohibition against payment of interest contained in the terms of any Parity Securities or securities ranking senior to the Debentures upon a liquidation of the Company. The Company's obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Common Stock to pay all Deferred Interest on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exits or is continuing.
Following the earlier of (A) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (B) the date of any payment of current interest during an Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall apply the net proceeds received by it from sales of Qualifying APM Securities to the payment of all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest with net proceeds to be paid promptly after receipt until all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest have been paid in full; , that the Company shall not be obligated to sell Qualifying APM Securities or apply the proceeds of sales thereof to payment of Deferred Interest if a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event has occurred and is continuing; provided, further, that if a Supervisory Event occurs because the FRB permits the Company to sell Qualifying APM Securities but disapproves the application of the net proceeds of such sale to pay deferred interest, the Company may, if the FRB so directs, sell Qualifying APM Securities and apply the proceeds to a purpose other than paying Deferred Interest without creating a breach of its obligations under Section 2.1(h) or any other provision of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture. In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of Qualifying APM Securities following the earlier of (x) such Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (y) the date of any payment of current interest during an Optional Deferral Period are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of Deferred Interest, such net proceeds will be paid to the holders of the Debentures on a basis; , that, if the Company has outstanding at such time any Parity Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated (I) to sell Qualifying APM Securities and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon) or (II) to apply the proceeds of any Qualifying APM Securities to payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon), then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales of Qualifying APM Securities and available for payment of Deferred Interest shall be applied to the Debentures and such Parity Securities on a basis, taking into account any net proceeds from the sales of securities other than Qualifying APM Securities that would be permitted to be applied to the payment of deferred interest (including additional interest thereon) on any such Parity Securities but not on the Debentures. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to sell Qualifying APM Securities or to apply such net proceeds or any portion thereof to the payment of Deferred Interest during the occurrence and continuation of Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Capital Securities Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.9, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them shall execute by manual or facsimile signature and deliver to the Property Trustee for further delivery, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount dated the date of execution by such Administrative Trustee.
The Securities Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of any Capital Securities that have been called for redemption. At the option of a Holder, Capital Securities Certificates may be exchanged for other Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of the same class and of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount upon surrender of the Capital Securities Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.9.
Every Capital Securities Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Securities Registrar duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Capital Securities Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of by the Property Trustee or Securities Registrar in accordance with such Person's customary practice.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates, but the Securities Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Securities Registrar, for so long as the Bank shall act as Securities Registrar.
Whenever this Trust Agreement makes reference to the execution of Trust Securities Certificates, such reference to execution shall mean manual execution by an Administrative Trustee or, in the alternative, execution by facsimile signature by an Administrative Trustee and authentication by the Property Trustee.
Capital Securities Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper Administrative Trustees of the Issuer Trust shall bind the Issuer Trust,
 
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such office prior to the authentication and delivery of such Capital Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such Capital Securities Certificates.
Each Capital Securities Certificate that is executed by facsimile and authenticated by the Property Trustee shall be dated the date of its authentication.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates and beneficial interests in Book-Entry Capital Securities of the kinds specified in this Section 5.5(b) shall be made only in accordance with this Section 5.5(b).
Certain Transfers and Exchanges.
(i) If the Holder of a Capital Securities Certificate (other than a Global Capital Securities Certificate) wishes at any time to transfer all or any portion of the Capital Securities represented thereby to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of Book-Entry Capital Securities represented by a Global Capital Securities Certificate, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this Clause (b)(i) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Securities Registrar of such Capital Securities Certificate as provided in Section 5.5(a) and instructions satisfactory to the Securities Registrar directing that a specified number of Capital Securities to be represented by the Global Capital Securities Certificate not greater than the number of Capital Securities represented by such Capital Securities Certificate be credited to a specified Clearing Agency Participant's account and then the Securities Registrar shall cancel such Capital Securities Certificate (and issue a new Capital Securities Certificate in respect of any untransferred portion thereof) as provided in Section 5.5(a) and increase the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Global Capital Securities Certificate by the Liquidation Amount represented by such Capital Securities so transferred as provided in Section 5.4(c).
Non-Global Capital Securities Certificate to Global Capital Securities Certificate.
(ii) Capital Securities other than Book-Entry Capital Securities may be transferred, in whole or in part, to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a Capital Securities Certificate that is not a Global Capital Securities Certificate as provided in Section 5.5(a).
Non-Global Capital Securities Certificate to Non-Global Capital Securities Certificate.
(iii) Capital Securities represented by a Global Capital Securities Certificate may be exchanged for a Capital Securities Certificate that is not a Global Capital Securities Certificate as provided in Section 5.4.
Global Capital Securities Certificate to Non-Global Capital Securities Certificate.
Before registering for transfer or exchange any Capital Securities Certificates issued in certificated fully registered form as provided in Sections 5.2, 5.4 or 5.5 of the Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee as Securities Registrar may require an Opinion of Counsel or other evidence satisfactory to it (which may include a certificate from such purchaser or Holder) that such purchaser or Holder is eligible for the exemptive relief available under U.S. Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("") 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 or another applicable exemption with respect to such purchase or holding and, in the case of any purchaser or Holder relying on any exemption other than PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14, an Opinion of Counsel or other evidence satisfactory to the Property Trustee with respect to the availability of such exemption. Any purchaser or Holder of any Capital Securities or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding thereof that either (i) it is not a Plan and no part of the assets to be used by it to purchase and/or hold such Capital Securities or any interest therein constitutes "plan assets" of any Plan, or (ii) it is itself a Plan or is purchasing or holding the Capital Securities or an interest therein on behalf of or with "Plan Assets" of
PTCE
 
one or more Plans, and each such purchase and holding of such securities either (A) satisfies the requirements of, and is entitled to full exemptive relief under, PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 (or some other applicable class or individual exemption) (or, in the case of a non-ERISA Plan, a similar exemption applicable to the transaction) or (B) will not result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or its equivalent under applicable similar laws.
(c) The Property Trustee shall not be required to insure or verify compliance with securities laws, including the Securities Act, Exchange Act and 1940 Act, in connection with transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates.
SECTION 5.6.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Securities Certificates.
If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall execute and make available for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time.
SECTION 5.7.
Persons Deemed Holders.
The Issuer Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Issuer Trustees nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.
SECTION 5.8.
Access to List of Holders' Names and Addresses.
Each Holder and each Owner shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Depositor, the Property Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or the Administrative Trustees accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.
SECTION 5.9.
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Property Trustee shall designate, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Capital Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Corporate Trust Office of the Property Trustee is initially designated the office for such purpose. The Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor and to the Holders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency.
 
SECTION 5.10.
Appointment of Paying Agent.
The Paying Agent shall make Distributions to Holders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions to the Property Trustee and the Administrative Trustees. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account for the purpose of making the Distributions referred to above. The Property Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent in its sole discretion. The Paying Agents shall initially be the Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Bank, and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee. In the event that the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). Such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Bank shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Trust Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.
SECTION 5.11.
Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor.
At the Closing Date, the Depositor shall acquire and retain beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities. Neither the Depositor nor any successor Holder of the Common Securities may transfer less than all the Common Securities, and the Depositor and any successor Holder may transfer the Common Securities only (i) in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another Person, or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Indenture, or (ii) to the Depositor or an Affiliate of the Depositor in compliance with applicable law (including the Securities Act and applicable State securities and blue sky laws). To the fullest extent permitted by law, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities other than as set forth in the next preceding sentence shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating substantially "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 5.11 OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT.
SECTION 5.12.
Notices to Clearing Agency.
To the extent that a notice or other communication to the Owners is required under this Trust Agreement, unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall have been issued to all Owners pursuant to Section 5.4(b), the Issuer Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to Owners to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners.
SECTION 5.13.
Rights of Holders.
(a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust
 
Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and, except to the extent set forth in Section 4.8, when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in Trust Property. Except as set forth in Section 4.8, the Holders, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default under Section 5.1(a)(1) of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 27, 2008, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee with a copy to the Property Trustee. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, institute a legal proceeding against the Depositor to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Indenture without first instituting legal proceedings against the Property Trustee or any other person. If a Debenture Event of Default has occurred due to Depositor's failure to pay interest in full on the Debentures for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of the 10-year period following the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, then a registered Holder of Capital Securities may institute a direct action on or after the due date directly against the Depositor for enforcement of payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Debentures to that Holder with respect to Debentures having a principal amount equal to the total liquidation amount of that Holder's Capital Securities. If such a Debenture Event of Default occurs, a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Holders of the Capital Securities shall be entitled to remove or appoint the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)) on all of the Debentures,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and
(C) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
 
The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Capital Securities all or part of which is represented by Book-Entry Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).
(c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(a)(1), 5.1(b)(2) or 5.1(b)(3) of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 27, 2008, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or interest on Debentures having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a ""). In addition, if such a Debenture Event of Default results from the failure to pay interest in full on the Debentures for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of the 10-year period following the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, then a Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a Direct Action against the Debenture Issuer on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures.
Direct Action
SECTION 6.1.
Limitations on Voting Rights.
(a) Except as expressly provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as partners or members of an association.
(b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Issuer Trust, the Property Trustee shall not (i) direct the time, method or place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Property Trustee with respect to such
 
Debentures, (ii) waive any past default which is waivable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of all Outstanding Capital Securities, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Issuer Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received from the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustee shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
provided, however,
(c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to this Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 6.2.
Notice of Meetings.
Notice of all meetings of Holders of Capital Securities, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each such Holder at such Holder's address as it appears in the Securities Register as of the record date for such meeting. Such notice shall be sent, first-class mail, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting.

If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding at least a majority of the Liquidation Amount of Outstanding Capital Securities held by the Holders of record present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of Capital Securities, unless this Issuer Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
SECTION 6.4.
Voting Rights.
In respect of any matter as to which a Holder is entitled to vote, such Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 in Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities held of record by such Holder.

Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
SECTION 6.6.
Holder Action by Written Consent.
Any action which may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if Holders holding a majority of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
SECTION 6.7.
Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
For the purpose of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or to act by written consent, or to participate in any Distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees or Property Trustee may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
SECTION 6.8.
Acts of Holders.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders or Owners may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders or Owners in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby)
 
are herein sometimes referred to as the "" of the Holders or Owners signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness to such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
The ownership of Capital Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.

SECTION 7.2.
Representations and Warranties of Depositor.
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that the Trust Securities Certificates issued on the Closing Date on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been, duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the

SECTION 8.1.
Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee from liability for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct with respect to acts or omissions. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee has duties and liabilities relating thereto to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement.

If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holder of the Common Securities or the Holders of the Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11 if applicable, any Holder who has been a Holder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.

(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

SECTION 9.4.
Liquidation.
(a) If an Early Termination Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs, or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid mailed not later than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall:
(i) state the Liquidation Date;
(ii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures; and
(iii) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Administrative Trustees) shall deem appropriate.
(b) Unless Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and the distribution of Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such
 
procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates.
(c) Unless Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, (iii) the Depositor shall use its best efforts to have the Debentures listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange, interdealer quotation system or self-regulatory organization as the Capital Securities are then listed, (iv) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures, accruing interest at the rate provided for in the Debentures from the last Distribution Date on which a Distribution was made on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (v) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates.
(d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, then the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Issuer Trust shall be wound-up by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution of the Issuer Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the ""). If, upon any such winding up, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such winding-up (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(a)(1), 5.1(b)(2) or 5.1(b)(3) of the Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities as provided in Section 4.3.

The Issuer Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any entity, except pursuant to this Article Nine.

provided,
Successor Securities
 
statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holder of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Issuer Trust has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Issuer Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act and (vii) the Depositor owns all of the common securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of all Outstanding Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other Person or permit any other Person to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Issuer Trust or the successor Person to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 10.1.
Limitation of Rights of Holders.
The death or incapacity, or the dissolution, liquidation, termination, or the bankruptcy of any Person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor dissolve, terminate or annul the Trust, nor entitle the legal representatives, successors or heirs of such Person or any Holder for such Person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them.

of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Issuer Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Issuer Trust's status as a grantor trust or cause the Issuer Trust to be an association taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes or the Issuer Trust's exemption from status of an investment company under the 1940 Act.
(c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each Holder, this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made as of a specified date or (ii) restrict the right of a Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date; notwithstanding any other provision herein, without the unanimous consent of the Holders, this paragraph (c) of this Section 10.2 may not be amended.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, without the consent of the Depositor, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation or liability on the Depositor.

(g) No amendment to this Trust Agreement that affects the Property Trustee's or the Delaware Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under this Trust Agreement or would otherwise expose the Property Trustee to any liability or be contrary to applicable law shall be adopted unless the prior written consent to such amendment be received by the Depositor from the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be. The Property Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is in compliance with this Trust Agreement.

(A) the duties and obligations of the Guarantee Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Guarantee Agreement, and the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Guarantee Agreement; and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Guarantee Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Guarantee Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Guarantee Agreement;
(ii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Guarantee Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Guarantee Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts upon which such judgment was made;
(iii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under this Guarantee Agreement; and
