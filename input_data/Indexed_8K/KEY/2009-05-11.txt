     (b) The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Manager, but only with reference to information relating to the Manager furnished to the Company in writing by the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, any issuer free writing prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could

have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by Section 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Manager on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by the Manager. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Manager on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Manager and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Manager agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares sold by it were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Manager has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not
pro rata
 
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Manager, any person controlling the Manager or any affiliate of the Manager or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.

provided
     (d) Any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified in such notice of termination; that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by the Manager or the Company, as the case may be.

Exhibit 99.2
CLEVELAND, May 11, 2009  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced that it plans to sell up to $750 million aggregate principal amount of its common shares in a so-called "at the market" offering and has filed a prospectus supplement to its existing automatic shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offering.
     Today's announcement was the first leg of KeyCorp's action plan for increasing its Tier 1 common equity capital following the announcement on May 7, 2009, that KeyCorp needed to increase its Tier 1 common equity by $1.8 billion in order to satisfy the requirements of the federal government's Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  or "stress test"  under which the regulators are requiring the tested bank holding companies to hold additional capital buffers against a "more adverse than expected" macroeconomic scenario were it to become a reality. KeyCorp has named Morgan Stanley as its sales agent in connection with the offering.
     The widely-reported government stress tests of the largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies were, according to the government, a "what-if" exercise to determine appropriate levels of capital for a worse than anticipated economic environment. Although KeyCorp meets the regulatory requirements for being "well-capitalized" today, and holds capital significantly in excess of all required regulatory measures, under the "what-if" scenario of a much harsher economic environment, the stress test determined that Key would be best served by raising the level of its Tier 1 common equity by $1.8 billion.
     KeyCorp reported that additional actions are also contemplated, including possibly public and/or private transactions in which certain currently outstanding Tier 1 capital instruments are exchanged for common shares, a move that would further enhance KeyCorp's Tier 1 common equity.
 
     KeyCorp also noted that the government's pre-provision earnings scenarios used under the "more adverse than expected" scenario were extremely conservative and below KeyCorp's own internal expectation, and that an economic environment that is better than the tested scenario would likely yield additional capital generation through earnings.
Cleveland-based KeyCorp is one of the nation's largest bank-based financial services companies, with assets of approximately $97 billion. BusinessWeek Magazine named Key the top bank in its Customer Service Champ 2009 edition, ranking Key 11th out of the top-25 companies that include many known for their customer service acumen. Key companies provide investment management, retail and commercial banking, consumer finance, and investment banking products and services to individuals and companies throughout the United States and, for certain businesses, internationally.

Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the company has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the company and this offering.
