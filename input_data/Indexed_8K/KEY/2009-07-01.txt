FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CLEVELAND, July 1, 2009  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced the final results of its offer to exchange (the "") KeyCorp common shares for any and all outstanding shares of its 7.750% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the ""), as well as the final results of its separate offer to exchange KeyCorp common shares for any and all outstanding trust preferred securities ("") of KeyCorp Capital I, KeyCorp Capital II, KeyCorp Capital III, and KeyCorp Capital VII (the ""). J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as KeyCorp's sole financial advisor in connection with the Series A Exchange Offer. J.P.

In the aggregate, these exchange offers generated approximately $540 million of additional Tier 1 common equity toward fulfillment of the $1.8 billion "capital buffer" that KeyCorp was required to raise under the SCAP assessment. As a result of these, and previously executed exchange offers, KeyCorp will also reduce its dividend and interest obligations on exchanged securities by approximately $70 million through the end of the SCAP assessment period. Together with the $1.3 billion of Tier 1 common equity previously raised by KeyCorp following receipt of the SCAP results, KeyCorp believes that it has now complied with the requirements of the SCAP assessment, having generated total Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of $1.8 billion.
"These exchange offers are part of a broader capital plan that Key has been implementing to strengthen our capital in the event that the economy deteriorates in a manner that is consistent with the government's more adverse scenario' from the SCAP assessment," said Henry Meyer, KeyCorp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Throughout this financial crisis, KeyCorp's capital ratios have been above the well-capitalized' levels set by federal regulators. Nevertheless, the government's SCAP mandated that KeyCorp hold even more Tier 1 common equity to absorb losses should economic conditions worsen. With these actions we are even better situated, with strong capital ratios."
Both exchange offers expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 30, 2009. Approximately 2,130,461 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Series A Exchange Offer, and approximately $294,014,000 aggregate liquidation preference of Trust Preferred Securities were validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Trust Preferred Exchange Offer. The table below lists the final amounts that were validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration date for each series that was part of the Trust Preferred Exchange Offer and the Series A Exchange Offer, the aggregate liquidation preference remaining outstanding, and the number of KeyCorp common shares issued in exchange for each series.
The settlement for both exchange offers is expected to occur on July 6, 2009. Upon settlement, 2,904,839 shares of Series A Preferred Stock will remain outstanding for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. KeyCorp will issue approximately 29.2 million KeyCorp common shares in exchange for the Series A Preferred Stock tendered and accepted by KeyCorp for exchange and approximately 46.3 million KeyCorp common shares in exchange for the Trust Preferred Securities tendered and accepted by KeyCorp for exchange, as further described in the table below.
In addition, KeyCorp has obtained consents from holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation preference of the Trust Preferred Securities of KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II to amend the amended and restated trust agreements of KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II, respectively, in order to enable the redemption of any trust preferred securities of each of the KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II trusts held by KeyCorp or its affiliates as described in more detail in the applicable exchange offer documents. KeyCorp, KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II will enter into such amendments promptly and will then proceed to redeem the Trust Preferred Securities of KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II held by KeyCorp as a result of the consummation of the applicable exchange offer. A separate cash consent fee of $2.50 per $1,000 liquidation preference of Trust Preferred Securities of KeyCorp Capital I and KeyCorp Capital II will be paid to tendering and/or consenting holders.
Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the results of the Series A Exchange Offer and the Trust Preferred Exchange Offer are as follows:
 
In the near future, KeyCorp also expects to launch a separate exchange offer of KeyCorp common shares for outstanding trust preferred securities of KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, KeyCorp Capital IX, and KeyCorp Capital X (the ""). There are currently $1.74 billion aggregate liquidation preference of trust preferred securities outstanding for these trusts, primarily held by retail investors. Only a portion of these would be expected to be tendered in any exchange offer.
