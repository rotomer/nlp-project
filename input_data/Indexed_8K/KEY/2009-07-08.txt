In addition, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any Losses (or expenses relating thereto) related to, arising out of or in connection with any advice or services rendered or to be rendered by the Dealer Managers pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify a Dealer Manager to the extent that such Losses (or expenses relating thereto) are finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Dealer Manager. No Indemnified Person shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company or any other person for any act or omission on the part of any broker or dealer in securities or any commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and that no Indemnified Person shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company or any other person for any Losses arising from or in connection with any act or omission of any Dealer Manager in performing its obligations hereunder or otherwise in connection with the Exchange Offer, the purchase of Old Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer or any other action contemplated in the Exchange Offer Material, except to the extent that any such Losses are finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Dealer Manager.
provided
however
(b) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Indemnified Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 11, such Indemnified Person shall notify the Company in writing promptly after any written assertion of such claim threatening to institute an action or proceeding with respect thereto and shall notify the Company promptly of any action commenced against such Indemnified Person within a reasonable time after such Indemnified Person shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Failure so to notify the Company shall not, however, relieve the Company from any liability which it may have on account of the indemnity under this Section 11 if it has not been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure. Upon request of the Indemnified Person, the Company shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Company may designate in such proceeding and shall
 
pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Company and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Company shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any Indemnified Person in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Company agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(c) To the extent the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 11 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any Losses (and expenses relating thereto) referred to therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such Losses (and expenses relating thereto) (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and to the Dealer Managers, on the other hand, of the Exchange Offer or (ii) if the allocation provided by the preceding clause (i) is not available, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in such clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Dealer Managers, on the other hand, in connection with any matter that has resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; , , in no event shall the aggregate portion of the amount paid or payable by any Dealer Manager exceed the aggregate amount of fees actually received by such Dealer Manager under this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 11, the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and to the Dealer Managers, on the other hand, of the Exchange Offer shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total value received or contemplated to be received by the holders of Old Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer, whether or not consummated, bears to the aggregate fees paid or to be paid to the Dealer Managers under this Agreement. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Dealer Managers, on the other hand, (x) in the case of any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Dealer Managers, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission and (y) in the case of any other action or omission, shall
provided
however
 
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether such action or omission was taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or its affiliates or by the Dealer Managers, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action or omission. The respective obligations of each Dealer Manager to contribute pursuant to this Section 11 are several and not joint.
(d) The Company and each Dealer Manager agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 11 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (c) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the Losses referred to in this Section 11 shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro
rata
(e) The remedies provided for in this Agreement are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. The reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations of the Company provided for in this Agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
12. . The provisions of Sections 8, 11, 13, 19, 20 and 25 hereof shall apply to the Exchange Offer Material and any modification thereof and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any failure to commence, or the withdrawal, termination, expiration or consummation of, the Exchange Offer or the termination or assignment of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person, (iii) any withdrawal by the Dealer Managers pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise and (iv) the completion of the services of the Dealer Managers hereunder.
Full Force and Effect
13. . Any advice or opinions provided by the Dealer Managers will not be disclosed or referred to publicly or to any third party (other than to attorneys and accountants of the Company who agree to keep such advice or opinions confidential) except in accordance with the prior written consent of each Dealer Manager or as may be required by applicable laws. The Company agrees that any reference to a Dealer Manager in the Exchange Offer Material, or in any other release or communication relating to the Exchange Offer, is subject to the prior written approval of such Dealer Manager.
Confidentiality
14. . The Company acknowledges that each Dealer Manager is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, as well as providing investment banking and financial advisory services. In the ordinary course of the trading and brokerage activities of the Dealer Managers, any Dealer Manager or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities of the Company or any other company that may be involved in the Exchange Offer.
Trading Activities
 
15. . This Agreement may be terminated upon the earlier of (a) the expiration, withdrawal or termination of the Exchange Offer, (b) the date of the Dealer Managers' withdrawal pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement or (c) the time and date at which this Agreement is terminated by the mutual consent of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement pursuant to this Section 15, the right to compensation and reimbursement pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 of this Agreement, accrued prior to the date of such termination, and the indemnity and the other provisions set forth in Sections 11 and 12 hereof will remain operative.
Termination
16. . If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the agreements contained herein is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.
Severability
17. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
18. . This Agreement, including any right to indemnity or contribution hereunder, shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Company, each Dealer Manager and the other Indemnified Persons, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy.
Binding Effect
19. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
Governing Law
20. . THE COMPANY HEREBY (A) SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, (B) AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, (C) WAIVES THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND (D) AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.
CONSENT TO JURISDICTION
21. . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
