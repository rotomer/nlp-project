Reference is made to KeyCorp's Form S-4 Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-159490), as amended, pertaining to KeyCorp's Offer to Exchange (the "Exchange Offer") up to 158,518,835 Common Shares of KeyCorp for any and all trust preferred securities of KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, KeyCorp Capital IX, and KeyCorp Capital X (collectively, the "Trust Preferred Securities"). Reference is also made to KeyCorp's Form 8-K (Item 8.01) filing dated July 22, 2009, in which KeyCorp reported that it had amended its previously announced Exchange Offer of Common Shares for any and all Trust Preferred Securities to reduce the amount of Trust Preferred Securities that will be accepted for exchange from $1,740,000,000 in aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding Trust Preferred Securities to a maximum total of $500,000,000 in aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding Trust Preferred Securities. The maximum number of KeyCorp Common Shares that may be issued in the Exchange Offer remains unchanged at 158,518,835 shares. If upon expiration of the Exchange Offer KeyCorp receives in excess of $500,000,000 in aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding Trust Preferred Securities, KeyCorp will determine the liquidation preference of Trust Preferred Securities that will be accepted from each tendering holder in the Exchange Offer on a pro rata basis (based upon the proportion the Trust Preferred Securities to be accepted for exchange bears to the total number of Trust Preferred Securities validly tendered by all tendering holders). All other terms of the Exchange Offer remain unchanged.
Consistent with the amendment to limit the overall maximum liquidation preference of Trust Preferred Securities to be accepted in the Exchange Offer, KeyCorp is hereby filing revised financial information to reflect that limit and also to give effect to and show the pro forma impact of the Exchange Offer on its financial condition and earnings as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, and as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Such information is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference.
pro forma
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein and in Exhibit 99.1 shall have the same meanings attributed to such terms as set forth in the Prospectus dated July 7, 2009 filed in the Form S-4 Registration Statement.

99.1 Unaudited Financial Information
Pro Forma
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
The following selected unaudited financial information has been presented to give effect to and show the impact of the Exchange Offer on our financial condition and earnings as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, and as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009.

The unaudited financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily indicate the financial position or results that would have been realized had the Exchange Offer been completed as of the dates indicated or that will be realized in the future when and if the Exchange Offer is consummated. The selected unaudited financial information has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, our summary historical consolidated financial information included in the Prospectus and our historical consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and our Current Report on Form 8-K (Items 2.02 and 9.01) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, filed with the SEC on July 22, 2009.

Our unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2009 have been presented as if the Exchange Offer had been completed on June 30, 2009 and our consolidated statements of income have been presented as if the Exchange Offer had been completed on January 1, 2008.

For purposes of the presentations for the year ended December 31, 2008 and period ended June 30, 2009, and as of June 30, 2009, we have assumed that the Average VWAP per share of our Common Shares is $5.21, which we determined assuming the Pricing Date for the determination of the Average VWAP ended on and included July 2, 2009.
pro forma
Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheets
We have shown the pro forma impact of a "High Participation Scenario" and a "Low Participation Scenario" with respect to the Exchange Offer prepared using the assumptions set forth below. The actual June 30, 2009 column reflects the impact of the Institutional Exchange Offer and the Series A Exchange Offer that expired on June 30, 2009 (and settled on July 6, 2009). The "High Participation Scenario" assumes the tender of 75% of the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities and the exchange (after proration to 29% of the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities based on the maximum of $500 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Trust Preferred Securities that will be accepted in the Exchange Offer) of such securities for Common Shares. The "Low Participation Scenario" assumes the tender and exchange of 25% of the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities for Common Shares.
There can be no assurances that the foregoing assumptions will be realized in the future, including as to the amounts and percentage of Trust Preferred Securities that will be tendered in the Exchange Offer and not subsequently withdrawn.
