Exhibit 99.1
News
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          CLEVELAND, January 21, 2010  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced a fourth quarter net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $258 million, or $.30 per common share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $524 million, or $1.07 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2008.
          During the fourth quarter, Key continued to increase its loan loss reserves by recording a $756 million provision for loan losses, which exceeded net charge-offs by $48 million. At the end of the quarter, Key's allowance for loan losses was $2.5 billion, or 4.31% of total loans, up from $1.6 billion, or 2.24%, one year ago. The loss for the current quarter is largely the result of an increase in the provision for loan losses, write-downs of certain commercial real estate related investments, the provision for losses on lending-related commitments and costs associated with other real estate owned ("OREO"). These charges were offset in part by a $106 million credit to income taxes, due primarily to the settlement of IRS audits for the tax years 1997-2006. Included in the credit is a final adjustment of $80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues.
          For the full year, Key had a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $1.581 billion, or $2.27 per common share. Per share results for the current year are after preferred stock dividends of $294 million, or $.42 per common share. These dividends include a noncash deemed dividend of $114 million related to the exchange of Key common shares for Key's Series A Preferred Stock as part of the company's efforts to raise

additional Tier 1 common equity, and cash dividend payments of $125 million made to the U.S. Treasury Department under the Capital Purchase Program. Results for the current year compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $1.337 billion, or $2.97 per common share, for 2008.
          Full-year results for both 2009 and 2008 were adversely affected by elevated provisions for loan losses and write-offs of certain intangible assets. In addition, 2008 results include a $1.011 billion after-tax charge recorded in the second quarter as a result of an adverse federal tax court ruling that impacted Key's accounting for certain lease financing transactions.
          "Although this remains a challenging environment, we are encouraged by the continued stabilization of the economy and some positive trends in our fourth quarter results," said Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Our net interest margin benefited from improved funding costs and better earning asset yields."
          Meyer continued: "Asset quality remains an area of focus for the company, however, during the fourth quarter we saw meaningful improvement in most of our credit metrics, including decreases in delinquencies, criticized and classified assets, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. In addition, our allowance for loan losses stood at 4.31% of total loans and 116% of nonperforming loans at December 31."
          Key's estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 common equity ratios were 12.68% and 7.46%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. These strong capital ratios reflect the successful capital raises and exchanges completed over the course of the year, whereby Key raised approximately $2.4 billion of new Tier 1 common equity.
          The company originated approximately $7.5 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter, and $32 billion during the year. Key's average deposits grew by $3 billion, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter.
          Key has continued to invest in its relationship businesses, including its 14-state branch network. Key opened 38 new branches in 8 markets in 2009 and the company expects to open 40 additional new branches in 2010. The company has completed renovations on approximately 160 branches over the past two years and expects to renovate another 100 branches in 2010.
          "We clearly have work remaining, but as we turn our sights to 2010, we believe our aggressive actions over the past two years to address asset quality, to strengthen capital, reserves and liquidity; and to invest in and reshape our businesses have Key on the right track, and will set the stage for us to emerge from this extraordinary period as a strong, competitive company," concluded Meyer.

SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $637 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, and the net interest margin was 3.04%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $624 million and a net interest margin of 2.79% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The net interest margin for the year-ago quarter was reduced by 8 basis points as a result of an agreement reached with the IRS on all material aspects related to the IRS global tax settlement pertaining to certain leveraged lease financing transactions. During the first half of 2009, the net interest margin remained under pressure as customers continued to paydown existing loans and new loan demand remained soft given the uncertain economic environment. During the second half of 2009, Key began to benefit from lower funding costs as higher costing certificates of deposit originated in the prior year began to mature and repriced to current market rates. In 2010, Key expects to realize additional benefits from the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit.
          Compared to the third quarter of 2009, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $38 million, and the net interest margin rose by 24 basis points. Much of the improvement reflects reduced funding costs attributable to the repricing of certain deposits, and the shift to a lower cost mix of deposits. In addition, Key's yield on earning assets increased as securities replaced federal funds sold as part of the company's liquidity management strategy, and improved spreads were achieved on new loan volume.
          Key's noninterest income was $469 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $383 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects net gains of $80 million from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to net losses of $37 million for the same period last year, and a $22 million increase in investment banking income. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, Key recorded net losses (included in miscellaneous income) of $39 million related to the volatility associated with the hedge accounting applied to debt instruments. These factors were offset in part by losses related to certain commercial real estate related investments, primarily due to changes in their fair values. Net losses from investments made by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business rose by $34 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2009, the investments remaining in this portfolio had a carrying amount of approximately $63 million, representing 51% of Key's original investment. Key also experienced a $31 million reduction in income from dealer trading and derivatives activities, including a $16 million loss recorded during the current quarter as a result of changes in the fair values of certain commercial mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2009, these securities had a carrying amount of approximately $29 million, representing 33% of their face value. The improvement in noninterest income was also moderated by lower income from trust and investment services, service charges on deposit accounts and operating leases.

          The major components of Key's fee-based income for the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Fee-based Income  Major Components
          Compared to the third quarter of 2009, noninterest income increased by $87 million. The increase was driven by an $86 million improvement in principal investing results (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) and a $10 million increase in income from corporate owned life insurance. Additionally, during the third quarter, the company incurred a $17 million loss associated with the exchange of common shares for capital securities. The positive effect of these factors was partially offset by a $21 million reduction in results from investment banking and capital markets activities, due primarily to changes in the fair values of certain commercial real estate related investments, and increases in a variety of other miscellaneous income components.
          Key's noninterest expense was $871 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $1.264 billion for the same period last year. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2008 was adversely affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $465 million. Excluding this charge, noninterest expense for the current quarter was up $72 million, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. Personnel expense decreased by $5 million. Nonpersonnel expense rose by $77 million, reflecting increases of $34 million in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment, $32 million in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments and $19 million in costs associated with OREO, including write-downs and losses on sales.
          Compared to the third quarter of 2009, noninterest expense decreased by $30 million. Personnel expense grew by $20 million, due to an adjustment to the year-to-date incentive compensation accruals. For the current year, incentive compensation, which includes commissions, decreased by $57 million, or 20%, compared to the prior year. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $50 million, reflecting a $45 million write-off of intangible assets associated with Key's equipment leasing business during the third quarter of 2009 and a $26 million reduction in costs associated with OREO. These items were partially offset by a $22 million increase in professional fees, due primarily to increased collection efforts on loans and higher legal expenses.
ASSET QUALITY
          Key's provision for loan losses was $756 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $551 million for the year-ago quarter and $733 million for the third quarter of 2009. Key's provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2009 exceeded net loan charge-offs by $48 million. As a result, Key's allowance for loan losses was $2.5 billion, or 4.31% of total loans, at December 31, 2009, compared to 4.00% at September 30, 2009, and 2.24% at December 31, 2008.

          Selected asset quality statistics for Key for each of the past five quarters are presented in the following table.
Selected Asset Quality Statistics from Continuing Operations
 
          Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $708 million, or 4.64% of average loans. These results compare to $309 million, or 1.67%, for the same period last year and $587 million, or 3.59%, for the previous quarter.
          Key's net loan charge-offs by loan type for each of the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Net Loan Charge-offs from Continuing Operations
          Compared to the third quarter of 2009, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio increased by $111 million. The increase was attributable to an aggregate $131 million in net charge-offs recorded on two specific commercial real estate related relationships in the commercial and financial, and commercial real estate portfolios, as well as the continuation of elevated net charge-offs on other commercial real estate loans. The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business within the National Banking group accounted for most of the growth in net charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio. The level of net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio rose by $10 million. As shown in the table on page 8, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $141 million, or 20%, of Key's total net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs in the exit portfolio increased by $4 million

from the third quarter of 2009. Management expects Key's net charge-offs to remain elevated in 2010, but anticipates that the level of net charge-offs will be lower than that experienced in 2009.
          At December 31, 2009, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $2.2 billion and represented 3.72% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 3.68% at September 30, 2009, and 1.68% at December 31, 2008. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2009, totaled $2.5 billion and represented 4.25% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 4.46% at September 30, 2009, and 2.00% at December 31, 2008. The following table illustrates the trend in Key's nonperforming assets by loan type over the past five quarters.
Nonperforming Assets from Continuing Operations
          Nonperforming assets decreased during the fourth quarter of 2009, for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2006. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans held for sale and a decrease in nonaccrual loans in the commercial portfolio, resulting from the charge-off of two large commercial real estate related relationships in the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business within the National Banking group. These reductions were offset in part by an increase in restructured loans accruing interest. Key is working closely with its customers to understand their financial difficulties, identify viable solutions and minimize the potential for loss. In that regard, Key has modified the terms of select loans, primarily those in the commercial real estate portfolio. Since these loans have demonstrated sustained payment capability, they continue to accrue interest. As shown in the following table, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $599 million, or 24%, of Key's total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2009, compared to $665 million, or 24%, at September 30, 2009.
          The composition of Key's exit loan portfolio at December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the fourth and third quarters of 2009, and the nonperforming status of these loans at December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009, are shown in the following table.

CAPITAL
          Key's risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2009.
Capital Ratios
          Key completed a series of successful capital raises and exchanges during 2009 that generated approximately $2.4 billion of new Tier 1 common equity to bolster the company's overall capital and to respond to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program initiated by the U.S. Treasury Department and the federal banking regulators. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2009, Key had a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.68%, a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 7.46% and a tangible common equity ratio of 7.56%.
          Transactions that caused the change in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the following table.

Major Business Groups

Community Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful
Community Banking Summary of Operations
          Community Banking recorded a net loss attributable to Key of $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to net income of $41 million for the year-ago quarter. Increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense caused the decline, and more than offset increases in net interest income and noninterest income.
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose by $6 million, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2008, as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in the prior year began to mature and repriced to current market rates. In addition, average deposits grew by $1.5 billion, or 3%, while the mix of these deposits changed. The increase in average deposits reflects strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts, which more than offset declines in money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and 2009 Results January 21, 2010 Page 11
          Noninterest income rose by $4 million, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter, due to higher letter of credit fees and mortgage loan sale gains, and lower reserves on customer derivatives. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in service charges on deposit accounts, resulting from the continuation of changes in client behavior, and a decline in asset management and trust fees.
          The provision for loan losses rose by $126 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting a $69 million increase in net loan charge-offs, primarily from the commercial and home equity loan portfolios. Community Banking's provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2009 exceeded its net loan charge-offs by $93 million, as the company continued to increase reserves in light of the challenging credit conditions brought on by a weak economy.
          Noninterest expense grew by $30 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter, due largely to a $26 million increase in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment, and a higher provision for losses on lending-related commitments. The adverse effect of these factors was offset in part by lower computer processing and personnel expense. The lower personnel expense reflects a reduction in salaries expense, caused by a decrease of 620 average full-time equivalent employees from the year-ago quarter, and a decline in severance expense, partially offset by an increase in the cost of employee benefits.
National Banking
 
KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter and 2009 Results January 21, 2010 Page 12
National Banking Summary of Continuing Operations
          National Banking recorded a loss from continuing operations attributable to Key of $291 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a $631 million loss from continuing operations attributable to Key for the same period one year ago. A substantial decrease in noninterest expense was partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses, lower net interest income and a decrease in noninterest income. During the fourth quarter of 2008, results were adversely affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $465 million ($420 million, after tax), which resulted from a reduction in the fair value of net assets caused by weakness in the financial markets.
          Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $9 million, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to a $10.9 billion, or 23%, reduction in average earning assets. The impact of this reduction was offset in part by more favorable earning asset spreads and an $18 million charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of an agreement reached with the IRS on all material aspects related to the IRS global tax settlement pertaining to certain leveraged lease financing transactions.
          Noninterest income declined by $76 million, or 33%, from the fourth quarter of 2008, due in part to losses related to certain commercial real estate related investments, primarily caused by changes in their fair value. Net losses from investments made by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business rose by $34 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in noninterest income also reflected lower income from dealer trading and derivatives activities, trust and investment services, and operating leases. These adverse factors were partially offset by an increase in investment banking income.
          The provision for loan losses rose by $86 million from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to higher levels of net loan charge-offs from the commercial loan portfolios.
          Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $30 million, or 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2008, caused primarily by higher costs associated with OREO, and a provision for losses on lending-related commitments of $14 million during the current quarter, compared to a credit of $7 million in the year-ago quarter. These adverse factors were partially offset by lower personnel expense, reflecting a decrease of 619 average full-time equivalent employees.
          In October 2009, management announced its decision to discontinue the education lending business, and to focus on the growing demand from schools for integrated, simplified billing, payment and cash management solutions. The Consumer Finance line of business will continue to service existing loans in this portfolio. In April 2009, Key made the strategic decision to curtail the operations of Austin Capital Management, Ltd., an investment subsidiary that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its institutional customer base. As a result of these decisions, Key has applied discontinued operations accounting to these businesses.
Other Segments
          Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key's Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income attributable to Key of $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $40 million for the same period last year. These results reflect net gains from principal investing attributable to Key of $44 million ($28 million after tax) during the current quarter, compared to net losses of $33 million ($21 million after tax) in the year-ago quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Key recorded net losses of $39 million related to the volatility associated with the hedge accounting applied to debt instruments. The majority of these losses were attributable to the restructuring of certain cash collateral arrangements for hedges that reduced exposure to counterparty risk and lowered the cost of borrowings.

In October 2008, Key exited retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and began to limit new education loans to those backed by government guarantee. In September 2009, management made the decision to discontinue the education lending business and to focus on the growing demand from schools for integrated, simplified billing, payment and cash management solutions. The Consumer Finance line of business continues to service existing loans in these portfolios. These actions are consistent with Key's strategy of de-emphasizing nonrelationship or out-of-footprint businesses.

The table below presents certain earnings data and performance ratios, excluding (credits) charges related to intangible assets impairment and the tax treatment of certain leveraged lease financing transactions disallowed by the IRS. Management believes that eliminating the effects of significant items that are generally nonrecurring facilitates the analysis of results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
The table also shows the computations of certain financial measures related to "tangible common equity" and "Tier 1 common equity." The tangible common equity ratio has become a focus of some investors and management believes that this ratio may assist investors in analyzing Key's capital position absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders' equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and minority interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard.
Because the Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Key's capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, management believes it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Key's capital adequacy on these same bases. The table also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, Key has procedures in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components and to ensure that Key's performance is properly reflected to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
