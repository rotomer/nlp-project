Exhibit 99.1
News
     CLEVELAND, July 22, 2010  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced second quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $56 million, or $.06 per common share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $394 million, or $.68 per common share, for the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively impacted by an $823 million loan loss provision. Second quarter net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $29 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $390 million for the second quarter of 2009. Net loss attributable to Key common shareholders for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was $67 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $926 million for the same period one year ago.
     Key's second quarter earnings improvement results from a lower provision for loan losses, higher fee income, and well-controlled expenses when compared to the first quarter of 2010. Credit quality continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking. Net charge-offs declined by $87 million, and nonperforming loans decreased by $362 million from March 31, 2010.
     "These results are encouraging and the return to profitability represents an important step forward for our company," said Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III. "Continued improvement in credit quality across most of our businesses was the principal contributor to the quarterly performance."
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 2
     Meyer continued: "Key is now focusing on opportunities in a gradually improving economy. That said, some uncertainty remains in the markets, and consumer and business loan demand is soft. Recognizing current economic conditions, we remain focused on investing in our relationship businesses, maintaining our strong capital and liquidity positions, reducing risk, and careful expense control as we navigate through the economic cycle."
     At June 30, 2010, Key's estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.01% compared to 7.51% at March 31, 2010, and estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.55% up from 12.92% one quarter ago.
     Key's strong capital and liquidity positions enable the Company to support the borrowing needs of clients. The Company originated approximately $7.6 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter.
     Meyer also noted that Key opened 18 new branches during the first six months and expects to open an additional 22 new branches during the remainder of 2010, increasing its market presence in selected markets of its 14-state branch network. In addition, Key continues with its plans to modernize its existing branches.
     The following table shows Key's continuing and discontinued operating results for the comparative quarters and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.
Results of Operations
 
SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $623 million for the second quarter of 2010, and the net interest margin was 3.17%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $575 million and a net interest margin of 2.70% for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. The Company continues to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and increasing lower costing transaction accounts. The Company expects this change in funding mix to continue through the second half of 2010
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 3
as certificates of deposit mature and re-price to lower current market rates. Over the past year, funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long-term debt and the 2009 exchanges of capital securities for Key common shares. Key also experienced improved spreads on loan renewals.
     Compared to the first quarter of 2010, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $9 million, and the net interest margin fell by two basis points. Although there was a benefit from the improvement in the mix of deposits, the decline in the net interest margin was largely the result of funds from loan pay downs being reinvested in lower yielding investment securities.
     Key's noninterest income was $492 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $706 million for the year-ago quarter. The second quarter of 2009 included a $125 million net gain from the sale of collateralized mortgage obligations, a $95 million gain related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities, and a $32 million gain from the sale of Key's claim associated with the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Additionally, net gains on leased equipment during the second quarter of 2010 declined by $34 million from the year-ago quarter. Partially offsetting this decline in noninterest income were net gains of $25 million from loan sales, and net gains of $17 million from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the second quarter of 2010, compared to net losses of $3 million and $6 million for the same period last year, as well as an increase in investment banking and capital markets income of $17 million during the second quarter of 2010.
     The major components of Key's fee-based income for the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Fee-based Income  Major Components
     Compared to the first quarter of 2010, noninterest income increased by $42 million. This increase in noninterest income resulted from an increase of $22 million in investment banking and capital markets income, a $21 million increase in net gains from loan sales, and increases in various other miscellaneous income components. These gains were partially offset by a $20 million decline in net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests).
     Key's noninterest expense was $769 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $855 million for the same period last year. FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased by $37 million from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of a special assessment imposed during that time period. Key also recorded a credit of $10 million to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments during the second quarter of 2010, compared to a charge to the provision of $11 million in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, Key recognized a $16 million charge to the provision for losses on low-income housing tax credit ("LIHTC") guaranteed funds and incurred $14 million more in operating lease expense than in the current quarter.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 4
     Compared to the first quarter of 2010, noninterest expense decreased by $16 million. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $39 million, reflecting a decrease in other real estate owned ("OREO") expense of $10 million, an increase in the credit to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments of $8 million, and reductions in various other miscellaneous expense items. These items were partially offset by a $23 million increase in personnel expense due primarily to compensation accruals on increases in fee-related revenues and improved profitability.
ASSET QUALITY
     Key's provision for loan losses was $228 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $823 million for the year-ago quarter and $413 million for the first quarter of 2010. Key's allowance for loan losses was $2.2 billion, or 4.16% of total loans, at June 30, 2010, compared to 4.34% at March 31, 2010, and 3.48% at June 30, 2009.
     Selected asset quality statistics for Key for each of the past five quarters are presented in the following table.
Selected Asset Quality Statistics from Continuing Operations
 
     Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $435 million, or 3.18% of average loans. These results compare to $502 million, or 2.93%, for the same period last year and $522 million, or 3.67%, for the previous quarter. Management expects net charge-offs to remain elevated in 2010 but continue to show improvement in future quarters.
     Key's net loan charge-offs by loan type for each of the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Net Loan Charge-offs from Continuing Operations
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 5
     Compared to the first quarter of 2010, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $59 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the real estate construction loan portfolio. The level of net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio also declined by $28 million. As shown in the table on page 6, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $114 million, or 26.21%, of Key's total net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs in the exit loan portfolio decreased by $39 million from the first quarter of 2010, primarily driven by improvements in the residential properties  homebuilder and marine portfolios.
     At June 30, 2010, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $1.7 billion and represented 3.19% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 3.69% at March 31, 2010, and 3.25% at June 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2010 totaled $2.1 billion and represented 3.88% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 4.31% at March 31, 2010, and 3.77% at June 30, 2009. The following table illustrates the trend in Key's nonperforming assets by loan type over the past five quarters.
Nonperforming Assets from Continuing Operations
 
     Nonperforming assets continued to decrease during the second quarter of 2010, representing the third consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in the commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural portfolios. These reductions were offset in part by an increase in nonperforming loans held for sale and consumer loans. As shown in the following table, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $385 million, or 18.46%, of Key's total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2010, compared to $499 million, or 20.55%, at March 31, 2010.
     Shown in the following table are the composition of Key's exit loan portfolio at June 30, 2010, and March 31, 2010, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the first and second quarters of 2010, and the nonperforming status of these loans at June 30, 2010, and March 31, 2010.

Summary of Changes in Common Shares Outstanding
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 7
     During each of the first and second quarters of 2010, Key made a $31 million cash dividend payment to the U.S. Treasury Department as a participant in the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program. During 2009, Key made four quarterly dividend payments aggregating $125 million to the U.S. Treasury Department.
LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
     The following table shows the contribution made by each major business group to Key's taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations and income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key for the periods presented. The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major business groups are described under the heading "Line of Business Descriptions." During the first quarter of 2010, Key re-aligned its reporting structure for its business groups. Prior to 2010, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios which were identified as exit or run-off portfolios and were included in Key's National Banking segment. Effective for all periods presented, Key is reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re-aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Community Banking segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the National Banking segment have been moved to Other Segments. For more detailed financial information pertaining to each business group and its respective lines of business, see the tables at the end of this release.

Additional Community Banking Data
Community Banking Summary of Operations
     Community Banking recorded net income attributable to Key of $32 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $30 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense and an increase in noninterest income contributed to the improvement in the second quarter of 2010.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $29 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2009, due to declines in average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3 billion, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial loan and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $2 billion, or 5%. The mix of deposits continues to change from the prior period as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years mature, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.
     Noninterest income increased by $6 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, due to higher income from trust and investment services, electronic banking fees, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives. The increase in trust and investment services income reflects increased performance in our Key Private Bank, as well as growth in our branch based investment services. These factors were partially offset by lower service charges on deposits, increased net losses on securities from a Community Development lending investment, and decreases in various other components of noninterest income.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 9
     The provision for loan losses declined by $78 million, or 39%, compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to the improved economic conditions from one year ago and lower loan balances.
     Noninterest expense declined by $41 million, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter. FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased $29 million from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of a special assessment imposed during that time period, and a credit of $4 million was recorded to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a charge of $4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by increases in personnel expense and professional fees.
National Banking
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful
National Banking Summary of Operations
     National Banking recorded net income attributable to Key of $33 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to a $211 million net loss attributable to Key for the same period one year ago. This improvement in the second quarter of 2010 was a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for loan losses.
     Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $35 million, or 15%, from the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower earning assets, partially offset by improved earning asset yields. Average earning assets decreased by $8 billion, or 26%, from the year-ago quarter.
     Noninterest income declined $1 million from the second quarter of 2009. Investment banking and capital markets income increased $18 million, and net gains from loan sales were $9 million, compared to net losses from loan sales of $7 million for the same period one year ago. These gains were offset by decreases in brokerage commissions and fee income of $13 million, operating lease revenue of $8 million, and various other miscellaneous income items from the second quarter of 2009.
     The provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2010 was $99 million compared to $494 million for the same period one year ago. National Banking continued to experience improved asset quality for the third quarter in a row.
 
KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 10
     Noninterest expense decreased by $33 million, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of a credit of $6 million to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a charge of $13 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating lease expense, the provision for losses on LIHTC guaranteed funds, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums also declined from the second quarter of 2009. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs and higher costs associated with OREO.
Other Segments
     Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key's Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios which were previously included within the National Banking segment. These exit portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $29 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to net income attributable to Key of $8 million for the same period last year. These results reflect an increase in net interest income from the second quarter of 2009 as well as a decrease in the provision for loan losses. In addition, net gains from principal investing attributable to Key were $12 million during the current quarter, compared to net losses of $10 million in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the same period in the prior year, the impact of the above items was partially offset by net gains of $125 million recorded in connection with the repositioning of the securities portfolio as well as a $95 million gain related to the exchange of Key common shares for capital securities during the second quarter of 2009.

KeyCorp Reports Second Quarter 2010 Profit July 22, 2010 Page 15
The table below presents the computations of certain financial measures related to "tangible common equity" and "Tier 1 common equity." The tangible common equity ratio has become a focus of some investors, and management believes that this ratio may assist investors in analyzing Key's capital position absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders' equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard.
Because the Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Key's capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, management believes it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Key's capital adequacy on these same bases. The table also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, Key has procedures in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components and to ensure that Key's performance is properly reflected to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
