The Notes may be issued as senior indebtedness (the "Senior Notes") or as subordinated indebtedness (the "Subordinated Notes") of the Company. The Senior Notes will be issued under an indenture, dated as of June 10, 1994 (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Senior Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as successor to Bankers Trust Company, as Trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), and the Subordinated Notes will be issued under an indenture, dated as of June 10, 1994 (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Subordinated Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as successor to Bankers Trust Company, as Trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee"). The Senior Indenture and Subordinated Indenture are herein sometimes collectively referred to individually as an "Indenture" and collectively as "Indentures" and the Senior Trustee and Subordinated Trustee are herein sometimes collectively referred to individually as a "Trustee" and collectively as the "Trustees." Wherever the terms "Indenture" and "Trustee" are used with respect to a specific issuance of Notes they shall mean the Senior Indenture and Senior Trustee, in the case of an issuance of unsecured and unsubordinated Notes, and the Subordinated Indenture and Subordinated Trustee, in the case of an issuance of unsecured and subordinated Notes. The Notes shall have the maturities, interest rates, redemption provisions, if any, and other terms set forth in the supplement to the Basic Prospectus referred to below.

So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to any Agent, the Company shall not, without the consent of such Agent, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, Notes or any other debt securities with a maturity at the time of original issuance of 9 months or more except pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, or except pursuant to a private placement not constituting a public offering under the Securities Act or except in connection with a firm commitment underwriting pursuant to an underwriting agreement that does not provide for a continuous offering of medium-term debt securities.

Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal
Solicitations as Agent
provided, however
     The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes. Upon receipt of at least one business day's prior notice from the Company, each Agent will suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent or Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
     Each purchase of Notes shall be (i) at a discount from the principal amount of such Notes as agreed between the Company and such Agent or (ii) as otherwise agreed between the Company and such Agent.
     The Agents are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Notes only in the principal amount of $1,000 (or, in the case of Notes not denominated in U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof in the applicable foreign currency or composite currency, rounded down to the nearest 1,000 units of such foreign currency or composite currency) or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 (or, in the case of Notes not denominated in U.S. dollars, 1,000 units of such foreign currency or composite currency). Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes received by such Agent as agent that in its judgment should be considered by the Company. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any offer to purchase Notes, as a whole or in part, that it considers to be unacceptable and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements herein contained. The procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Notes sold by an Agent as agent and the payment therefor are set forth in the Administrative Procedures (as hereinafter defined).
 
     (b) . Each sale of Notes to any Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless such Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof by, such Agent.
Purchase as Principal
     The commitment of any Agent to purchase Notes as principal, whether pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties (made or deemed to have been made as of the date of the Terms Agreement and as of the Time of Delivery (as defined below)) of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the applicable Terms Agreement. Each Terms Agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal (pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise) shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the maturity date of such Notes, the interest rate or interest rate basis, if any, applicable to such Notes, any other terms of such Notes, the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes (the time and date of any and each such delivery and payment, the "Time of Delivery"), any provisions relating to rights of underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of Notes, and, except as otherwise indicated in such Terms Agreement, shall require the delivery of opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant to Section 6 hereof. Unless otherwise specified in a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Notes purchased by an Agent as principal and the payment therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedures.
     Unless otherwise specified in a Terms Agreement, if you are purchasing Notes as principal you may resell such Notes to other dealers or to investors and other purchasers. Any such sales to other dealers may be at a discount, which shall not exceed the amount set forth in the Pricing Supplement relating to such Notes. Any such sales to investors and other purchasers may be at prevailing market prices, or prices related thereto at the time of such resale, at negotiated prices or otherwise, as determined by the Agent.
     If the Company and two or more Agents enter into an agreement pursuant to which such Agents agree to purchase Notes from the Company as principal and one or more of such Agents shall fail at the Time of Delivery to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase (the "Defaulted Notes"), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents or underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; provided, however, that if such arrangements shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period; then:
     (i) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents at the Time of Delivery, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial purchase obligations bear to the purchase obligations of all nondefaulting Agents; or
     (ii) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents at the Time of Delivery, such agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent.
     No action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default. Any such defaulting Agent shall reimburse the Company, within 15 days of the receipt by such defaulting Agent of an invoice from the Company, for any duly documented reasonable expenses incurred by the Company as a result of the default by such defaulting Agent. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of such agreement, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the rights to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
     (c) . The Company acknowledges that the obligations of the Agents are several and not joint and, subject to the provisions of this Section 2, each Agent shall have complete discretion as to the manner in which it solicits purchasers for the Notes and as to the identity thereof.
Obligations Several
     (d) . The Agents and the Company agree to perform their respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed in the Medium-Term Notes Administrative Procedures (the

     4. . The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent: (a) (i) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement which shall be reasonably disapproved by any Agent after reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, , that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission described in subsection (iii) below, copies of which filings the Company will cause to be delivered to the Agents promptly after their transmission to the Commission for filing; (ii) subject to the foregoing clause (i), (A) promptly to cause each Prospectus Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, (B) to prepare, with respect to any Notes to be sold through or to such Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Pricing Supplement with respect to such Notes in a form previously approved by such Agent and to file such Pricing Supplement in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, and (C) if agreed between the Company and such Agent, to prepare a Term Sheet, to file such Term Sheet in accordance with Rule 433(d) and promptly to file all material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d); and (iii) promptly to file all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Notes. The Company will promptly advise each Agent (A) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any amendment to the Registration Statement and of the effectiveness of any such amendment to the Registration Statement; (B) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, a Prospectus Supplement or any document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the Prospectus; (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; of the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto or to any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus; and (D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose.

If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
Covenants of the Company
provided, however
     (b) To use its reasonable best efforts to qualify the Notes for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents shall reasonably request and to continue such qualification in effect so long as reasonably required in connection with the distribution of the Notes and to pay all fees and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agents) reasonably incurred in connection with such qualification and in connection with the determination of the eligibility of the Notes for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may reasonably designate; that the Company shall not be required to file a general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided.

     (c) To furnish each Agent and counsel to the Agents, at the expense of the Company, a signed copy of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and each amendment thereto, in each case including exhibits and documents incorporated by reference therein and, during the period mentioned in paragraph (d) below, to furnish each Agent as many copies of the General Disclosure package and the Prospectus (including all amendments and supplements thereto) and documents incorporated by reference therein as such Agent may reasonably request.
     (d) If at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event shall occur as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or, if in the opinion of either such counsel, it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, or if at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances at that subsequent time, not misleading, to immediately notify the Agents by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and request each Agent (i) in its capacity as agent of the Company, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company (and, if so notified, such Agent shall cease such solicitations and cease using the Prospectus as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day later); and (ii) to cease sales of any Notes such Agent may then own as principal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is incorrect information in the written information furnished by the Agent or Agents to the Company for use in the Prospectus and if such Prospectus is required to be reprinted, then the expense of reprinting such Prospectus shall be borne, severally, by the Agent or Agents who shall have furnished such incorrect information. If any such amendment or supplement and any documents and certificates furnished to the Agents pursuant to Section 4(e) in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Agents, upon the filing with the Commission of such amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Agents will resume the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4(d), until the distribution of any Notes any Agent may own as principal has been completed or in the event such Agent, in the opinion of its counsel, is otherwise required to deliver a prospectus in respect of a transaction in the Notes, if any event described in this Section 4(d) occurs the Company will, at its own expense, promptly prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement, satisfactory in all respects to such Agent, that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, will supply such amended or supplemented Prospectus to such Agent in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request and shall furnish to such Agent pursuant to Section 4(e) such documents and certificates as it may request in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement.

Costs and Expenses
     6. . The obligation of any Agent, as agent of the Company, at any time ("Solicitation Time") to solicit offers to purchase the Notes, the obligation of any Agent to purchase Notes as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, and the obligation of any other purchaser to purchase Notes shall in each case be subject: (1) to the condition that all representations and warranties of the Company herein and all statements of officers of the Company made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof are accurate (i) in the case of an Agent's obligation to solicit offers to purchase Notes, at and as of such Solicitation Time and (ii) in the case of any Agent's or any other purchaser's obligation to purchase Notes, at and as of the time the Company accepts the offer to purchase such Notes and, as the case may be, at and as of the related Time of Delivery or time of purchase; (2) to the condition that at or prior to such Solicitation Time, time of acceptance, Time of Delivery or time of purchase, as the case may be, the Company shall have complied with all its agreements and all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder; and (3) to the following additional conditions when and as specified:
Conditions
     (a) Prior to such Solicitation Time or corresponding Time of Delivery or time of purchase, as the case may be:
     (i) the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including, if applicable, the Pricing Supplement) with respect to such Notes shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; no
 
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission;
     (ii) there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (i) any intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any review or possible change that does not indicate an improvement, in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act;
     (iii) there shall not have occurred any change or any development in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of the applicable Agent, materially impairs the investment quality of the Notes; and

Promptly after the determination by any such Agent or other purchaser that it is impractical or inadvisable to market the Notes, such Agent or other purchaser shall notify the Company of such determination in writing; but the omission so to notify the Company shall not act to modify the rights of the Agent or other purchaser under this Section 6(a)(iv)(A).

     (iii) The Notes conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained or incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package (if applicable), the Prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, and such description conforms in all material respects to the rights set forth in the instruments defining the same.
     (iv) The Notes have been duly and validly authorized and, when executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture and issued to and paid for by any purchaser of Notes sold through an Agent as agent or any Agent as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or other agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of such applicable Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     (v) Each of the Senior Indenture and the Subordinated Indenture has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Indentures have been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
     (vi) The issue and sale of the Notes and the execution and delivery by the Company of the Notes, the Indentures, this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement pursuant to which an Agent purchases Notes as principal and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any statute, rule or regulation, any agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it or any of them are bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any its subsidiaries is subject and that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Regulations, or any order known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company.
     (vii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or filing with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Notes or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement pursuant to which an Agent purchases Notes as principal, or the Indentures, except such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with offers and sales of the Notes from the Company and with purchases of Notes.
     (viii) The Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act; any required amendment or supplement to each prospectus relating to the offered Notes (including the Prospectus) pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reference to Rule 424(b)(8)); any required filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
     (ix) Such counsel is of the opinion ascribed to it in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Material United States Tax Considerations," if any.
     (x) Such counsel (A) is of the opinion that at the time the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, became effective or is deemed effective, and at the date such opinion is delivered, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and at the time they were filed, each document incorporated by reference therein (other than the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto and the audit reports thereon, or any other financial and statistical data set forth or referred to therein or in any document incorporated by reference therein or any exhibits thereto, and the Statements of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit thereto, as to which we express no opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder;
 
(B) has no reason to believe that (other than the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto and the audit reports thereon, or any other financial and statistical data set forth or referred to therein or in any document incorporated by reference therein or any exhibits thereto, and the Statements of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit thereto, as to which we express no opinion) the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, as of its effective date and each deemed effective date, and if an amendment to the Registration Statement or to any document incorporated by reference therein has been filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, at the time of the most recent such filing, and at date such opinion is delivered, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (C) has no reason to believe that (other than the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto and the audit reports thereon, or any other financial and statistical data set forth or referred to therein or in any document incorporated by reference therein or any exhibits thereto, and the Statements of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit thereto, as to which we express no opinion) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date, at the Commencement Date and the Time of Delivery, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (D) has no reason to believe that the General Disclosure Package (if applicable), as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (E) does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed which is not filed as required; provided that in the case of an opinion delivered on the Commencement Date (other than in connection with a Terms Agreement), the opinion and beliefs set forth in clauses (A), (C) and (D) above shall be deemed not to cover information concerning an offering of particular Notes to the extent such information will be set forth in a supplement to the Basic Prospectus.
     Such opinion or opinions shall be to such further effect with respect to other legal matters relating to this Agreement, and the sale of the Notes, pursuant to this Agreement as counsel for the Agents may reasonably request. Such opinion or opinions shall be limited New York, Ohio and federal law and, if applicable, the law of the state of incorporation of any other Significant Subsidiaries. In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions in which such counsel is not qualified and the federal law of the United States, upon opinions of other counsel, who shall be counsel satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, in which case the opinion shall state that they believe you and they are entitled to so rely. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company, KeyBank and the Significant Subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.
     In rendering their opinion, such counsel may rely upon the opinion of Jones Day referred to below as to any matters governed by New York law covered therein.

     (f) On the Commencement Date and at each Time of Delivery, the Company shall have furnished to the relevant Agent or Agents such further certificates and documents as such Agent or Agents may reasonably request. All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are satisfactory in form and substance to the relevant Agent or Agents. The Company will furnish the relevant Agent or Agents with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as the relevant Agent or Agents shall reasonably request.
     7. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement when such part became effective, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any Specified Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent specifically for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided, however
     (b) Each Agent severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement when such part became effective, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any Specified Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party
 
shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , that, if the defendants in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representations of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties (and the reasonable fees and expenses of one such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party.
provided, however
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering of the Notes to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation or profit (before deducting expenses) received or realized by the Agents from the purchase and resale, or underwriting, of such Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of the commissions at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
     8. . (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time (i) by the Company with respect to any or all of the Agents or (ii) by any Agent with respect to itself only, in each case upon the giving of written notice of such termination to each other party hereto. Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in the discretion
Termination
 
of the Agent or Agents that are parties thereto by notice given to the Company prior to the payment for any Note to be purchased thereunder, if at or prior to such time any of the conditions specified in Section 6(a) hereof shall not have been satisfied. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal (whether pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise) and the termination of such an agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated with respect to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such termination has not occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued or which relate to Notes which are already issued, agreed to be issued or the subject of a pending offer at the time of such termination and (z) in any event, the provisions of the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 2(c), the last sentence of Section 4(d) and Sections 4(g), 4(h), 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 17 shall survive; that if at the time of termination an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the Time of Delivery to the purchaser or its agent of such Notes has not yet occurred, the provisions of Sections 2(b), 2(d), 4(a) through 4(e), 4(i) and 6 shall also survive. If any Terms Agreement is terminated, the provisions of the last sentence of Section 4(d) and Sections 2(b), 2(d), 4(a), 4(b), 4(e), 4(h) through 4(i), 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 17 (which shall have been incorporated by reference in such Terms Agreement) shall survive.
provided
     (b) If this Agreement or any Terms Agreement shall be terminated by an Agent or Agents because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Terms Agreement or any condition of any Agent's obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse each Agent or such Agents as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Agent or Agents in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Notes.
     9. . Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Notes from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect of any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal and does not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of Notes. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes from the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold the relevant Agent harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
Position of the Agents
     10. . The respective indemnities and contribution agreements, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein or certificates of its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any such agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.

          (2) In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and any supplemental financial information or schedules audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the published rules and regulations thereunder.

cc: The existing Agents     Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee

Exhibit 4.1
     Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of June 10, 1994 and supplemented as of November 14, 2001, relating to unsecured and unsubordinated notes (the "Indenture") between KeyCorp, an Ohio corporation (the "Company'), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on May 15, 2008, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the forms of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, and to establish the procedures for the authentication and delivery of specific Securities from time to time pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture. As authorized by the Indenture, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order has the same effect as, and is being used in lieu of, a supplemental indenture thereto.
     All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to the establishment of (i) a series of Securities, (ii) the forms of such series of Securities, and (iii) the procedures for the authentication and delivery of such series of Securities have been complied with.
     Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     A. .
Establishment of Series pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
     There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture):
     (1) The Securities of such series shall bear the title "Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series K" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
     (2) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be issued pursuant to this Officers' Certificate is unlimited.
(3)    (a) Each Note within such series shall mature on a date 9 months or more from its date of issue as specified in such Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; provided, however, that no Commercial Paper Rate Note (as defined below) shall mature less than 9 months and 1 day from its date of issue. If the Maturity Date or Redemption Date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for any Note is a day that is not a Business Day, principal will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such specified Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable. With respect to the Notes of this series, unless otherwise defined in the Pricing Supplement, (i) "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York;
 
provided, however, that, with respect to foreign currency notes, such day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the principal financial center (as defined) of the country issuing the specified currency (or, if the specified currency is the euro and for EURIBOR Notes (as defined below), such day is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open, which we refer to as a TARGET business day); provided, further, that, with respect to notes as to which LIBOR is an applicable interest rate basis, such day is also a London Business Day; (ii) "London Business Day" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in the designated LIBOR currency) in London; and (iii) "principal financial center" means (1) the capital city of the country issuing the specified currency or (2) the capital city of the country to which the designated LIBOR currency relates, as applicable, except, in the case of (1) or (2) above, that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, euro, New Zealand dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "principal financial center" shall be The City of New York and (solely in the case of the specified currency) Sydney, Toronto, London (solely in the case of the designated LIBOR currency), Wellington, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
     (b) If specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement Notes that the Notes are "Renewable Notes", the Renewable Notes will mature on an interest payment date as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "initial maturity date"), unless the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount is extended as described below. On the interest payment dates in June and December each year (unless different interest payment dates are specified in the Pricing Supplement), which are "election dates", the maturity of the Renewable Notes will be extended to the interest payment date occurring 12 months after the election date, unless the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of the Renewable Notes or any portion having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. To terminate, notice has to be delivered to the paying agent not less than nor more than the number of days specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement prior to the related election date. The option may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of the Renewable Notes so long as the principal amount for which the option is not exercised is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000. The maturity of the Renewable Notes may not be extended beyond the final maturity date that is set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity and the election is not revoked, then the portion of the Renewable Note for which election was made will become due and payable on the interest payment date, unless another date is set forth in the Pricing Supplement, falling six months after the election date prior to which the holder made such election. An election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity may be revoked as to any portion of the Renewable Notes having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof by delivering a notice to the paying agent on any day following the effective date of the election to terminate the automatic extension and prior to the date 15 days before the date on which the portion would have matured.
     (c) If specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement Notes that the Notes are "Extendible Notes", the Company has the option to extend the stated maturity of such
 
Extendible Notes for an extension period. Such an extension period is one or more periods of one to five whole years, up to but not beyond the final maturity date described in the related Pricing Supplement. The Company may exercise its option to extend the Extendible Note by notifying the applicable trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to the then effective maturity date. If the Company elects to extend the Extendible Note, the Trustee (or paying agent) will mail (at least 40 days prior to the maturity date) to the registered holder of the Extendible Note a notice ("Extension Notice") informing the holder of its election, the new maturity date and any updated terms. Upon the mailing of the Extension Notice, the maturity of such Extendible Note will be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice. However, the Company may, not later than 20 days prior to the maturity date of an Extendible Note (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), at its option, establish a higher interest rate, in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, or a higher spread and/or spread multiplier, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, for the extension period by mailing or causing the Trustee (or paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate or higher spread and/or spread multiplier to the holder of the Extendible Note. The notice will be irrevocable. If the Company elects to extend the maturity of an Extendible Note, the holder of the note will have the option to instead elect repayment of the note by the Company on the then effective maturity date. In order for an Extendible Note to be so repaid on the maturity date, the Company must receive, at least 25 days but not more than 35 days prior to the maturity date: (i) the Extendible Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Extendible Note duly completed; or (ii) a facsimile transmission, telex or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the holder of the Extendible Note, the principal amount of the Extendible Note, the principal amount of the Extendible Note to be repaid, the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of the Extendible Note, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the Extendible Note to be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Extendible Note, will be received by the Trustee (or paying agent) not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of the facsimile transmission, telex or letter; provided, however, that the facsimile transmission, telex or letter will only be effective if the Trustee or paying agent receives the Extendible Note and form duly completed by that fifth business day. A holder of an Extendible Note may exercise this option for less than the aggregate principal amount of the Extendible Note then outstanding if the principal amount of the Extendible Note remaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized denomination.
     (4) Each Note within such series that bears interest will bear interest at either (a) a fixed rate (the "Fixed Rate Notes"), (b) a floating rate determined by reference to one or more base rates, which may be adjusted by a Spread and/or Spread Multiplier (each as defined below) (the "Floating Rate Notes"), or (c) an indexed rate (the "Indexed Notes"). Notes within such series may also be issued as "Zero Coupon Notes" which do not provide for any periodic payments of interest. Notes may be issued as Original Issue Discount Notes at a discount from the principal amount thereof due at the stated maturity as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Any Floating Rate Note may also have either or both of the following as set forth in
 
the applicable Pricing Supplement: (i) a maximum interest rate limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (as defined below); and (ii) a minimum interest rate limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period. The interest rate on a Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is 25% per annum on a simple interest basis. This limit may not apply to Notes in which $2,500,000 or more has been invested. The applicable Pricing Supplement may designate any of the following interest rate bases or formulas ("Base Rates") as applicable to each Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CD Rate Note"; (b) the CMS Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CMS Rate Note"; (c) the CMT Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CMT Rate Note"; (d) the Commercial Paper Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"; (e) the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note"; (f) EURIBOR, in which case such note will be a "EURIBOR Note"; (g) the Federal Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Federal Funds Rate Note"; (h) LIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "LIBOR Note"; (i) the Prime Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Prime Rate Note"; (j) the Treasury Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Treasury Rate Note"; or (k) one or more other Base Rates.
     The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Period will be determined by reference to the applicable Base Rates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such Interest Period, plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, or multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be applied to the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note.
     Each Note that bears interest will bear interest from and including its date of issue or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on such Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) has been paid or duly provided for (i) at the fixed rate per annum applicable to the related Interest Period, (ii) at the rate determined pursuant to the applicable index, or (iii) at a rate per annum determined pursuant to the Base Rates applicable to the related Interest Period or Interest Periods, in each case as specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity or upon redemption. The first payment of interest on any Note originally issued after a Regular Record Date and on or before an Interest Payment Date will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest rates and Base Rates are subject to change by the Company from time to time but no such change will affect any Note theretofore issued or which the Company has agreed to issue. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Fixed Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Fixed Rate Notes" and the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Floating Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Floating Rate Notes".
     The applicable Pricing Supplement will specify: (i) the issue price, Interest Payment Dates and Regular Record Dates; (ii) with respect to any Fixed Rate Note, the interest rate; (iii)
 
with respect to any Index Note, the index; (iv) with respect to any Floating Rate Note, the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below), the method (which may vary from Interest Period to Interest Period) of calculating the interest rate applicable to each Interest Period (including, if applicable, the fixed rate per annum applicable to one or more Interest Periods, the period to maturity of any instrument on which the Base Rate for any Interest Period is predicated (the "Index Maturity"), the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, the Interest Determination Dates (as defined below), the Interest Reset Dates and any minimum or maximum interest rate limitations); (v) whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note; and (vi) any other terms related to interest on the Notes.
     .
Fixed Rate Notes
     Each Fixed Rate Note (except a Zero Coupon Note), whether or not issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, will bear interest at the annual rate specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Payment Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on June 15 and December 15 of each year and at maturity or upon redemption and the Regular Record Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be June 1 and December 1, respectively. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments for Fixed Rate Notes shall be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, the relevant Interest Payment Date. Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or any applicable Redemption Date on a Fixed Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
     A Fixed Rate Note may pay amounts in respect of both interest and principal amortized over the life of the Note (an "Amortizing Note"). Payments of principal and interest on Amortizing Notes will be made on the Interest Payment Dates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and at the Maturity Date or any earlier Redemption Date. Payments on Amortizing Notes will be applied first to interest due and payable and then to the reduction of unpaid principal amount.
     .
Floating Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and except as provided below, interest on Floating Rate Notes will be payable on the following Interest Payment Dates: in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes) with interest payable monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month of each year; in the case of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes, on the first calendar day of each month as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable semiannually, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable annually, on the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Interest will also be paid at maturity or upon redemption. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Regular Record Dates for the Floating Rate Notes will be the day (whether or not a Business Day) fifteen
 
calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, provided that, for LIBOR and EURIBOR notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
     The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually or on some other basis (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period", and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that are Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day, as provided below); in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
     The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to a Floating Rate Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, provided that, for LIBOR and EURIBOR notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as of the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" means the date as of which the new interest rate is determined for a particular Interest Reset Date, based on the applicable interest rate basis or formula as of that Interest Determination Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date. The "Calculation Date" is the date by which the calculation agent will determine the new interest rate that became effective on a particular Interest Reset Date based on the applicable interest rate basis or formula on the Interest Determination Date. The Interest Determination Date for all Floating Rate Notes (except LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Treasury Rate Notes and Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes) will be the second Business Day before the Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date in the case of LIBOR Notes will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, unless the designated LIBOR currency is British pounds sterling, in which case the Interest Determination Date will be the applicable Interest Reset Date. For EURIBOR Notes, the Interest Determination Date will be the second TARGET business day before the applicable Interest Reset Date.
 
     The Interest Determination Date for Treasury Rate Notes will be the day of the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the same index maturity are normally auctioned. Treasury bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on Tuesday. Sometimes, the auction is held on the preceding Friday. If an auction is held on the preceding Friday, that day will be the Interest Determination Date relating to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction date falls on any interest reset date, then the Interest Reset Date will instead be the first Business Day immediately following the auction date. The Interest Determination Date for an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note is the last Business Day of the month immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco published the index.
     Each interest payment on a floating rate note will include interest accrued from, and including, the issue date or the last interest payment date, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the following interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Accrued interest on a Floating Rate Note will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a note by an accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1) the actual number of days in the year, in the case of Treasury Rate Notes or CMT Rate Notes, or (2) 360, in the case of other Floating Rate Notes. All percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). All currency amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit (with five one-thousandths of a unit being rounded upward).
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, KeyBank National Association will be the "calculation agent". Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "calculation date", if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Floating Rate Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, or the maturity date, as the case may be.
     . CD Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period at an interest rate equal to the CD Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in such CD Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CD Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
CD Rate Notes
     The "CD Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate on that date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the index maturity described in the related pricing supplement, as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, for that interest determination date under the heading "CDs (secondary market)." The index maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related interest rate basis or formulae will be calculated.
 
     The calculation agent will observe the following procedures if the CD Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above described rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the CD Rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit of the index maturity described in the pricing supplement as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "CDs (secondary market)."
     (II) If that rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, quoted by three leading non-bank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money-center banks (in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the index maturity described in the pricing supplement. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (III) If fewer than three dealers are quoting as mentioned above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     As referenced above, "H.15(519)" means the weekly statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. "H.15 Daily Update" means the daily update of H.15(519), available through the Internet site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication.
     . CMS Rate Notes will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate based on the CMS Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
CMS Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMS Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate on the applicable Interest Determination Date for the designated maturity specified in the Pricing Supplement that appears on Reuters Screen ISDAFIX1 as of 11:00 a.m., New York city time.
     The following procedures will be followed if the CMS Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not displayed by 11:00 a.m. New York City time, the rate for such date shall be determined as if the parties had specified "USD-CMS-Reference Banks" as the applicable rate. "USD-CMS-Reference Banks" means, on any Interest Determination Date, the rate determined on the basis of the mid-market semi-annual swap rate quotations provided by the Reference Banks at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York city time on such Interest Determination Date; and for this purpose, the semi-annual swap rate means the mean of the bid and offered rates for the semi-annual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360 day count basis, of a
 
fixed-for-floating U.S. Dollar interest rate swap transaction with a term equal to the designated maturity commencing on that date and in a representative amount with an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market, where the floating leg, calculated on an actual/360 day count basis, is equivalent to USD-LIBOR-BBA with the designated maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The rate for that date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest).
     (II) If no rate is available as described above, the CMS Rate for the new Interest Reset Period will be the same as for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such interest reset period, the CMS Rate will be the initial interest rate.
     . CMT Rate Notes will bear interest at the interest rates calculated with reference to the CMT Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified in the CMT Rate Notes and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum and the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CMT Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date relating to a Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is determined with reference to the CMT Rate (a "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date"):
     (I) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Reuters Page FRBCMT CMT Rate cannot be determined as described in the preceding sentence:
     a. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities."
     b. If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519).
 
     c. If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the agents or their affiliates) (each, a "reference dealer") selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.
     d. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such index maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page
 
FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Reuters Page FEDCMT CMT Rate cannot be determined as described in the preceding sentence:
     a. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities."
     b. If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls.
     c. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.
     d. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the calculation agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated.
     e. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate interest
 
determination date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such index maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the calculation agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
     . Commercial Paper Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period at an interest rate equal to the Commercial Paper Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, as specified in such Commercial Paper Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
     The "Commercial Paper Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the money market yield (as defined below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the related pricing supplement, as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial" prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date.
     The calculation agent will observe the following procedures if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the money market yield of the rate on that Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the Pricing Supplement, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
     (II) If that rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the money market yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the pricing supplement placed for an
 
industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized securities rating organization. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (III) If fewer than three dealers selected by the calculation agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     "Money Market Yield" shall be a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
where "D" refers to the applicable annual rate for the commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which the interest is being calculated.
     . Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period based on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and any Spread and/or Spread Multiplier and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate on the applicable Interest Determination Date equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the interest determination date as displayed under the caption "11TH DIST COFI" on Reuters Page COFI/ARMS. "Reuters Page COFI/ARMS" means the display page designated as page COFI/ARMS on Reuters, or any successor service or page, for the purpose of displaying the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District, as of 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on such Interest Determination Date.
     The following procedures will be followed if the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not displayed on the applicable Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index on the applicable Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of San Francisco fails to announce the rate for the calendar month next preceding the applicable Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the new interest reset period will be the same as for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index will be the initial interest rate.
     (III) The "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index" will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank
 
District that the FHLB of San Francisco most recently announced as the cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the applicable Interest Determination Date.
     . EURIBOR Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period at an interest rate equal to EURIBOR, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in such EURIBOR Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement. The EURIBOR Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
EURIBOR Rate Notes
     The calculation agent will determine EURIBOR on each EURIBOR determination date, which is the second TARGET Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for each Interest Reset Period.
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, EURIBOR means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date relating to a Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is determined with reference to EURIBOR (a "EURIBOR interest determination date"), a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euro designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACI  the Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing that rate. EURIBOR will be determined in the following manner:
     (I) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, beginning on the second TARGET Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The calculation agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.
     (III) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the calculation agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
     If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new interest period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior interest
 
period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior interest period, however, it will remain in effect for the new interest period.
     "Euro-zone" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union.
     . Federal Funds Rate Notes will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in such Federal Funds Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement. The Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by reference to either the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate, the Federal Funds Open Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The Federal Funds Rate will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Federal Funds Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate determined by the calculation agent, with respect to any Interest Determination Date relating to a Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date"), in accordance with the following provisions:
     (I) If "Federal Funds (Effective) Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate with respect to such date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Federal Funds (effective)," as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1") under the heading "EFFECT," or, if such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal funds (effective)." If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the calculation agent, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; provided, however, that if the brokers so selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date without giving effect to any resetting of the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
 
     (II) If "Federal Funds Open Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date under the heading "Federal Funds" for the relevant Index Maturity and opposite the caption "Open" as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page 5 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page 5"), or, if such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for the Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the calculation agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; provided, however, that if the brokers so selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date without giving effect to any resetting of the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
     (III) If "Federal Funds Target Rate" is the specified Federal Funds Rate in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Federal Funds Rate as of the applicable Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on such date as displayed on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the rate for that day appearing on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page USFFTARGET="). If such rate does not appear on the FDTR Index page on Bloomberg or is not displayed on Reuters Page USFFTARGET= by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the calculation agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such federal funds rate interest determination date; provided, however, that if the brokers so selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date without giving effect to any resetting of the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.
     . LIBOR Notes will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate equal to the London interbank offered rate, referred to as LIBOR, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, as specified in such LIBOR Note and the
LIBOR Notes
 
applicable Pricing Supplement. The LIBOR Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
     On each Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in the designated LIBOR currency having the index maturity specified in such Pricing Supplement as such rate is displayed on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the designated LIBOR currency) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.
     On any Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01, the calculation agent will determine LIBOR as follows:
     (I) LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the relevant LIBOR interest determination date, at which deposits in the LIBOR currency having the index maturity described in the related Pricing Supplement, beginning on the relevant interest reset date and in a representative amount, are offered by four major banks in the London interbank market to prime banks in that market. The calculation agent will select the four banks and request the principal London office of each of those banks to provide a quotation of its rate for deposits in the LIBOR currency. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
     (II) If fewer than two quotations are provided as mentioned above, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in the principal financial center selected by the calculation agent at approximately 11:00 a.m. in the applicable principal financial center, on the Interest Determination Date for loans to leading European banks in the LIBOR currency having the index maturity designated in the pricing supplement and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the LIBOR currency in that market at that time. The calculation agent will select the three banks referred to above.
     (III) If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, LIBOR will remain LIBOR then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     As referenced above, "LIBOR currency" means the currency specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as to which LIBOR shall be calculated or, if no such currency is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, United States dollars.
     . Prime Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in the Prime Rate Notes and the applicable Pricing Supplement. Prime Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Prime Rate Notes
     The "Prime Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the prime rate or base lending rate on that date, as published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Bank Prime Loan" or, if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related calculation date, the rate on such
 
Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank Prime Loan."
     The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Prime Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on USPRIME1 as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If at least one rate but fewer than four rates appear on USPRIME1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted (on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date by three major money center banks in the City of New York selected by the calculation agent.
     (III) If the banks selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.
     "USPRIME1" means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1 Page" (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on such service) for the purpose of displaying Prime Rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.
     . Treasury Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the Treasury Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in the Treasury Rate Notes and the applicable Pricing Supplement. Treasury Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Treasury Rate Notes
     The "Treasury Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("treasury bills") having the index maturity specified in such Pricing Supplement under the caption "INVEST RATE" on the display on Reuters page USAUCTION10 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date.
     The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the Treasury Rate will be the bond equivalent yield (as defined below) of the auction rate of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such recognized
 
electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/ Treasury Bills/ Auction High."
     (II) If the rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date and cannot be determined as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Treasury Rate will be the bond equivalent yield of the auction rate of such Treasury Bills as otherwise announced by the United States Department of Treasury.
     (III) If the results of the most recent auction of Treasury Bills having the index maturity described in the pricing supplement are not published or announced as described above by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, or if no auction is held on the interest determination date, then the Treasury Rate will be the bond equivalent yield on such interest determination date of Treasury Bills having the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/ Treasury Bills/ Secondary Market" or, if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related calculation date, the rate on such interest determination date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/ Treasury Bills (Secondary Market)."
     (IV) If such rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the Treasury Rate to be the bond equivalent yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date of three leading primary U.S. government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the index maturity described in the related Pricing Supplement. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (V) If fewer than three dealers selected by the calculation agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Treasury Rate will remain the Treasury Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     "Bond equivalent yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
.
Zero Coupon Notes
     The specific terms of any Zero Coupon Notes will be set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
.
Indexed Notes
     The Company may issue notes for which the amount of interest or principal that will be paid will not be known on its date of issue. The Company will specify the formulae for computing interest or principal payments for these types of notes, which is called "Indexed Notes", by reference to securities, financial or non-financial indices, currencies, commodities, interest rates, or composites or baskets of any or all of the above. Examples of indexed items that the Company may use include a published stock index, the common stock price of a publicly traded company, the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese Yen, or the price in a particular market of a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude oil. The amount of interest and principal that will be paid will depend on the structure of the Indexed Note and the level of the specified indexed item throughout the term of the Indexed Note and at maturity. Specific information pertaining to the method of determining the interest payments and the principal amount will be described in the applicable Pricing Supplement, as well as additional risk factors unique to the Indexed Note, certain historical information for the specified indexed item and certain additional United States federal tax considerations.
     (5) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (if any) on the Notes will be payable, and, except as provided in Section 305 of the Indenture with respect to any Global Security (as defined below) representing Book-Entry Notes (as defined below), the transfer of the Notes will be registrable and Notes will be exchangeable for Notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the corporate trust office of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the "Paying Agent"), in New York City, New York, provided that payments of interest with respect to any Certificated Note (as defined below), other than interest at maturity or upon redemption, may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person or entity entitled thereto as it appears on the security register of the Company at the close of business on the Regular Record Date corresponding to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, holders of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Certificated Notes shall be entitled to receive payments of interest, other than interest at maturity or upon redemption, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been given to the Paying Agent in writing not later than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
     (6) If so specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company on the date or dates prior to maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement at the price or prices specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement: (i) Unless otherwise specified in such Pricing Supplement, in the case of Notes other than Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes, expressed as a specified percentage of the principal amount of such Note, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement; (ii) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, in the case of Zero Coupon Notes or certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement), as a specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount (as
 
defined below) of such Note (as described in paragraph (10) below), together with accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption (or, in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as specified in Paragraph (10) below). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company may redeem any of the Notes which are redeemable and remain outstanding either in whole or from time to time in part upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article Eleven of the Indenture.
     (7) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company shall not be obligated to redeem or purchase any Notes of such series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of any Holder.
     (8) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, Notes of such series may be issued only in fully registered form. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the authorized denomination of the Notes of such series other than Foreign Currency Notes (as defined below), shall be $1,000 or any amount in excess of $1,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000. Foreign Currency Notes will be issued in the denominations specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
     (10) The portion of the principal amount of the Notes, other than Original Issue Discount Notes (including any Zero Coupon Notes), which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof shall not be other than the principal amount thereof. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the portion of the principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes and certain interest bearing Notes issued as Original Issue Discount Notes (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) upon any acceleration of the maturity thereof will be the Amortized Face Amount and in the case of an interest-bearing note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest payments. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the amount payable to the holder of such Original Issue Discount Note upon any redemption thereof will be the applicable specified percentage of the Amortized Face Amount thereof specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and in the case of any interest bearing Note issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, any accrued but unpaid "qualified stated interest" payments (as defined in the Treasury Regulations regarding original issue discount issued by the Treasury Department (the "Regulations")). The "Amortized Face Amount" of an Original Issue Discount Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (a) the Issue Price (as set forth on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note) plus (b) the aggregate of the portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of such Original Issue Discount Note within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), whether denominated as principal or interest, over the Issue Price of Original Issue Discount Note) which shall theretofore have accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section 1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the date of issue of Original Issue Discount Note to the date of determination, minus (c) any amount considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of such Original Issue Discount Note which has been paid on such Original Issue Discount Note from the date of issue to the date of determination. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of such Note due at the stated maturity thereof.
 
     (11) The Notes may be denominated, and payments of principal of and interest on the Notes will be made, in United States dollars or in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units (a "Specified Currency") as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement ("Foreign Currency Notes").
     (12) Except as otherwise described in Paragraphs (4) and (10) above, the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the Notes will not be determined with reference to an index.
     (13) Foreign Currency Notes will be paid in U.S. dollars converted from the Specified Currency unless a Holder of Foreign Currency Notes elects to be paid in the Specified Currency or unless the applicable Pricing Supplement provides otherwise. In the case of a Note having a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the principal of that Note in U.S. dollars will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by an agent specified in the applicable pricing supplement (the "exchange rate agent") at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the exchange rate agent) selected by the exchange rate agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all holders of Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations are not available, the Company will make payments in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holders of the Foreign Currency Note by deductions from such payments. Unless indicated otherwise in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a holder of Foreign Currency Notes may elect to receive payment of the principal of and interest on the Foreign Currency Notes in the Specified Currency by transmitting a written request for such payment to the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of New York on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to maturity, as the case may be. A Holder may make this request in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by facsimile transmission. A Holder of a Foreign Currency note may elect to receive payment in the Specified Currency for all principal and interest payments and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such Holder's election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be. If a Specified Currency is not available for the payment of principal, premium or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of Foreign Currency Notes by making such payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of the specified currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "market exchange rate") as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second business day prior to such payment or, if not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate or as otherwise indicated in an applicable Pricing Supplement. All determinations referred to above made by the exchange rate agent will be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of clear error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holders of the Foreign Currency Notes.
 
     (15) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes shall be subject to the events of default specified in Section 501, paragraphs (1) through (8) of the Indenture.
     (16) Each Note will be represented by either a master global note or a global note in fully registered form (each a "Global Note") registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository (each such Note represented by a Global Note being herein referred to as a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive registered form, without coupons (a "Certificated Note"), as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, The Depository Trust Company will act as Depositary. Except as provided in Section 305 of the Indenture, Book-Entry Notes will not be issuable in certificated form and will not be exchangeable or transferable. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Note, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Book-Entry Note or Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes.
     (18) Interest will be payable to the person in whose name a Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined below) next preceding each Interest Payment Date (as defined below); provided, however, that interest payable at maturity or upon redemption will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable.
     (19) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes shall be defeasible pursuant to Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture.
     (22) The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in making payments in immediately available funds, but, except as otherwise provided under Additional Amounts in the applicable Pricing Supplement, any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holders of the Notes in respect of which such payments are made.
     (25) Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the resolutions and authorization referred to in the first paragraph hereof, the Notes shall have such other terms (which may be in addition to or different from the terms set forth herein) as are specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

Exhibit 4.2
     Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of June 10, 1994 and supplemented as of November 14, 2001, relating to unsecured and subordinated notes (the "Indenture") between KeyCorp, an Ohio corporation (the "Company'), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on May 15, 2008, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the forms of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, and to establish the procedures for the authentication and delivery of specific Securities from time to time pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture. As authorized by the Indenture, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order has the same effect as, and is being used in lieu of, a supplemental indenture thereto.
     All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to the establishment of (i) a series of Securities, (ii) the forms of such series of Securities, and (iii) the procedures for the authentication and delivery of such series of Securities have been complied with.
     Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     A. .
Establishment of Series pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
     There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture):
     (1) The Securities of such series shall bear the title "Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series L" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
     (2) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be issued pursuant to this Officers' Certificate is unlimited.
(3) (a) Each Note within such series shall mature on a date 9 months or more from its date of issue as specified in such Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; , that no Commercial Paper Rate Note (as defined below) shall mature less than 9 months and 1 day from its date of issue. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement, no Series L Note will mature less than 5 years from its date of issue. If the Maturity Date or Redemption Date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for any Note is a day that is not a Business Day, principal will be paid on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such specified Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as applicable. With respect to the Notes of this series, unless otherwise defined in the Pricing Supplement, (i) "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on
provided, however
 
which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; provided, however, that, with respect to foreign currency notes, such day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the principal financial center (as defined) of the country issuing the specified currency (or, if the specified currency is the euro and for EURIBOR Notes (as defined below), such day is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open, which we refer to as a TARGET business day); provided, further, that, with respect to notes as to which LIBOR is an applicable interest rate basis, such day is also a London Business Day; (ii) "London Business Day" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in the designated LIBOR currency) in London; and (iii) "principal financial center" means (1) the capital city of the country issuing the specified currency or (2) the capital city of the country to which the designated LIBOR currency relates, as applicable, except, in the case of (1) or (2) above, that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, euro, New Zealand dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "principal financial center" shall be The City of New York and (solely in the case of the specified currency) Sydney, Toronto, London (solely in the case of the designated LIBOR currency), Wellington, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
     (b) If specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement Notes that the Notes are "Renewable Notes", the Renewable Notes will mature on an interest payment date as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "initial maturity date"), unless the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount is extended as described below. On the interest payment dates in June and December each year (unless different interest payment dates are specified in the Pricing Supplement), which are "election dates", the maturity of the Renewable Notes will be extended to the interest payment date occurring 12 months after the election date, unless the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of the Renewable Notes or any portion having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. To terminate, notice has to be delivered to the paying agent not less than nor more than the number of days specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement prior to the related election date. The option may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of the Renewable Notes so long as the principal amount for which the option is not exercised is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000. The maturity of the Renewable Notes may not be extended beyond the final maturity date that is set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If the holder elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity and the election is not revoked, then the portion of the Renewable Note for which election was made will become due and payable on the interest payment date, unless another date is set forth in the Pricing Supplement, falling six months after the election date prior to which the holder made such election. An election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity may be revoked as to any portion of the Renewable Notes having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof by delivering a notice to the paying agent on any day following the effective date of the election to terminate the automatic extension and prior to the date 15 days before the date on which the portion would have matured.
 
     (c) If specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement Notes that the Notes are "Extendible Notes", the Company has the option to extend the stated maturity of such Extendible Notes for an extension period. Such an extension period is one or more periods of one to five whole years, up to but not beyond the final maturity date described in the related Pricing Supplement. The Company may exercise its option to extend the Extendible Note by notifying the applicable trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to the then effective maturity date. If the Company elects to extend the Extendible Note, the Trustee (or paying agent) will mail (at least 40 days prior to the maturity date) to the registered holder of the Extendible Note a notice ("Extension Notice") informing the holder of its election, the new maturity date and any updated terms. Upon the mailing of the Extension Notice, the maturity of such Extendible Note will be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice. However, the Company may, not later than 20 days prior to the maturity date of an Extendible Note (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), at its option, establish a higher interest rate, in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, or a higher spread and/or spread multiplier, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, for the extension period by mailing or causing the Trustee (or paying agent) to mail notice of such higher interest rate or higher spread and/or spread multiplier to the holder of the Extendible Note. The notice will be irrevocable. If the Company elects to extend the maturity of an Extendible Note, the holder of the note will have the option to instead elect repayment of the note by the Company on the then effective maturity date. In order for an Extendible Note to be so repaid on the maturity date, the Company must receive, at least 25 days but not more than 35 days prior to the maturity date: (i) the Extendible Note with the form "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Extendible Note duly completed; or (ii) a facsimile transmission, telex or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the holder of the Extendible Note, the principal amount of the Extendible Note, the principal amount of the Extendible Note to be repaid, the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of the Extendible Note, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the Extendible Note to be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Extendible Note, will be received by the Trustee (or paying agent) not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of the facsimile transmission, telex or letter; provided, however, that the facsimile transmission, telex or letter will only be effective if the Trustee or paying agent receives the Extendible Note and form duly completed by that fifth business day. A holder of an Extendible Note may exercise this option for less than the aggregate principal amount of the Extendible Note then outstanding if the principal amount of the Extendible Note remaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized denomination.
     (4) Each Note within such series that bears interest will bear interest at either (a) a fixed rate (the "Fixed Rate Notes"), (b) a floating rate determined by reference to one or more base rates, which may be adjusted by a Spread and/or Spread Multiplier (each as defined below) (the "Floating Rate Notes"), or (c) an indexed rate (the "Indexed Notes"). Notes within such series may also be issued as "Zero Coupon Notes" which do not provide for any periodic payments of interest. Notes may be issued as Original Issue Discount Notes at a discount from
 
the principal amount thereof due at the stated maturity as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Any Floating Rate Note may also have either or both of the following as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement: (i) a maximum interest rate limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period (as defined below); and (ii) a minimum interest rate limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest will accrue during any Interest Reset Period. The interest rate on a Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Under present New York law, the maximum rate of interest is 25% per annum on a simple interest basis. This limit may not apply to Notes in which $2,500,000 or more has been invested. The applicable Pricing Supplement may designate any of the following interest rate bases or formulas ("Base Rates") as applicable to each Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CD Rate Note"; (b) the CMS Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CMS Rate Note"; (c) the CMT Rate, in which case such Note will be a "CMT Rate Note"; (d) the Commercial Paper Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"; (e) the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note"; (f) EURIBOR, in which case such note will be a "EURIBOR Note"; (g) the Federal Funds Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Federal Funds Rate Note"; (h) LIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "LIBOR Note"; (i) the Prime Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Prime Rate Note"; (j) the Treasury Rate, in which case such Note will be a "Treasury Rate Note"; or (k) one or more other Base Rates.
     The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Period will be determined by reference to the applicable Base Rates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such Interest Period, plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, or multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any. The "Spread" is the number of basis points, each one-hundredth of a percentage point, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be added or subtracted from the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note. The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be applied to the Base Rate for a Floating Rate Note.
     Each Note that bears interest will bear interest from and including its date of issue or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on such Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) has been paid or duly provided for (i) at the fixed rate per annum applicable to the related Interest Period, (ii) at the rate determined pursuant to the applicable index, or (iii) at a rate per annum determined pursuant to the Base Rates applicable to the related Interest Period or Interest Periods, in each case as specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity or upon redemption. The first payment of interest on any Note originally issued after a Regular Record Date and on or before an Interest Payment Date will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest rates and Base Rates are subject to change by the Company from time to time but no such change will affect any Note theretofore issued or which the Company has agreed to issue. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Fixed Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Fixed Rate Notes" and the "Interest Payment Dates" and the "Regular Record Dates" for Floating Rate Notes shall be as described below under "Floating Rate Notes".
 
     The applicable Pricing Supplement will specify: (i) the issue price, Interest Payment Dates and Regular Record Dates; (ii) with respect to any Fixed Rate Note, the interest rate; (iii) with respect to any Index Note, the index; (iv) with respect to any Floating Rate Note, the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below), the method (which may vary from Interest Period to Interest Period) of calculating the interest rate applicable to each Interest Period (including, if applicable, the fixed rate per annum applicable to one or more Interest Periods, the period to maturity of any instrument on which the Base Rate for any Interest Period is predicated (the "Index Maturity"), the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, the Interest Determination Dates (as defined below), the Interest Reset Dates and any minimum or maximum interest rate limitations); (v) whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note; and (vi) any other terms related to interest on the Notes.
     .
Fixed Rate Notes
     Each Fixed Rate Note (except a Zero Coupon Note), whether or not issued as an Original Issue Discount Note, will bear interest at the annual rate specified therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Payment Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be on June 15 and December 15 of each year and at maturity or upon redemption and the Regular Record Dates for the Fixed Rate Notes will be June 1 and December 1, respectively. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest payments for Fixed Rate Notes shall be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, the relevant Interest Payment Date. Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or any applicable Redemption Date on a Fixed Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue for the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
     A Fixed Rate Note may pay amounts in respect of both interest and principal amortized over the life of the Note (an "Amortizing Note"). Payments of principal and interest on Amortizing Notes will be made on the Interest Payment Dates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and at the Maturity Date or any earlier Redemption Date. Payments on Amortizing Notes will be applied first to interest due and payable and then to the reduction of unpaid principal amount.
     .
Floating Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and except as provided below, interest on Floating Rate Notes will be payable on the following Interest Payment Dates: in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes) with interest payable monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month of each year; in the case of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes, on the first calendar day of each month as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable semiannually, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with interest payable annually, on the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Interest will also be paid at maturity or upon
 
redemption. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Regular Record Dates for the Floating Rate Notes will be the day (whether or not a Business Day) fifteen calendar days preceding each Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR and EURIBOR notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
     The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually or on some other basis (such specified period, an "Interest Reset Period", and the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Reset Date will be as follows: in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset daily, each Business Day; in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) which are reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that are Treasury Rate Notes which are reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week (except if the auction date falls on a Tuesday, then the next Business Day, as provided below); in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are reset annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
     The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to a Floating Rate Note (the "Initial Interest Rate") will be as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, that, for LIBOR and EURIBOR notes, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
provided
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest rate determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as of the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. As used herein, "Interest Determination Date" means the date as of which the new interest rate is determined for a particular Interest Reset Date, based on the applicable interest rate basis or formula as of that Interest Determination Date and calculated on the related Calculation Date. The "Calculation Date" is the date by which the calculation agent will determine the new interest rate that became effective on a particular Interest Reset Date based on the applicable interest rate basis or formula on the Interest Determination Date. The Interest Determination Date for all Floating Rate Notes (except LIBOR Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Treasury Rate Notes and Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes) will be the second Business Day before the Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date in the case of LIBOR Notes will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, unless the designated LIBOR currency is British pounds sterling, in which case the Interest Determination Date will be the applicable Interest Reset Date. For
 
EURIBOR Notes, the Interest Determination Date will be the second TARGET business day before the applicable Interest Reset Date.
     The Interest Determination Date for Treasury Rate Notes will be the day of the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the same index maturity are normally auctioned. Treasury bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on Tuesday. Sometimes, the auction is held on the preceding Friday. If an auction is held on the preceding Friday, that day will be the Interest Determination Date relating to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction date falls on any interest reset date, then the Interest Reset Date will instead be the first Business Day immediately following the auction date. The Interest Determination Date for an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note is the last Business Day of the month immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco published the index.
     Each interest payment on a floating rate note will include interest accrued from, and including, the issue date or the last interest payment date, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the following interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Accrued interest on a Floating Rate Note will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a note by an accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor is the sum of the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (1) the actual number of days in the year, in the case of Treasury Rate Notes or CMT Rate Notes, or (2) 360, in the case of other Floating Rate Notes. All percentages resulting from any calculation are rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). All currency amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit (with five one-thousandths of a unit being rounded upward).
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, KeyBank National Association will be the "calculation agent". Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the "calculation date", if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Floating Rate Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, or the maturity date, as the case may be.
     . CD Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period at an interest rate equal to the CD Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier as specified in such CD Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CD Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
CD Rate Notes
     The "CD Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate on that date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the index maturity described in the related pricing supplement, as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
 
calculation date, for that interest determination date under the heading "CDs (secondary market)." The index maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related interest rate basis or formulae will be calculated.
     The calculation agent will observe the following procedures if the CD Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above described rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the CD Rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit of the index maturity described in the pricing supplement as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "CDs (secondary market)."
     (II) If that rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, quoted by three leading non-bank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money-center banks (in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the index maturity described in the pricing supplement. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (III) If fewer than three dealers are quoting as mentioned above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     As referenced above, "H.15(519)" means the weekly statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. "H.15 Daily Update" means the daily update of H.15(519), available through the Internet site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at or any successor site or publication.
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update,
     . CMS Rate Notes will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate based on the CMS Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
CMS Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMS Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate on the applicable Interest Determination Date for the designated maturity specified in the Pricing Supplement that appears on Reuters Screen ISDAFIX1 as of 11:00 a.m., New York city time.
     The following procedures will be followed if the CMS Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not displayed by 11:00 a.m. New York City time, the rate for such date shall be determined as if the parties had specified "USD-CMS-Reference Banks" as the applicable rate. "USD-CMS-Reference Banks" means, on any Interest Determination Date, the
 
rate determined on the basis of the mid-market semi-annual swap rate quotations provided by the Reference Banks at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York city time on such Interest Determination Date; and for this purpose, the semi-annual swap rate means the mean of the bid and offered rates for the semi-annual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360 day count basis, of a fixed-for-floating U.S. Dollar interest rate swap transaction with a term equal to the designated maturity commencing on that date and in a representative amount with an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market, where the floating leg, calculated on an actual/360 day count basis, is equivalent to USD-LIBOR-BBA with the designated maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The rate for that date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest).
     (II) If no rate is available as described above, the CMS Rate for the new Interest Reset Period will be the same as for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such interest reset period, the CMS Rate will be the initial interest rate.
     . CMT Rate Notes will bear interest at the interest rates calculated with reference to the CMT Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, if any, as specified in the CMT Rate Notes and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. CMT Rate Notes will be subject to the minimum and the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "CMT Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date relating to a Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is determined with reference to the CMT Rate (a "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date"):
     (I) If "Reuters Page FRBCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters (or any successor service) on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FRBCMT") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Reuters Page FRBCMT CMT Rate cannot be determined as described in the preceding sentence:
     a. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities."
     b. If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as may then be published by either the
 
Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the rate that would otherwise have been published in H.15(519).
     c. If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (which may include the agents or their affiliates) (each, a "reference dealer") selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.
     d. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such index maturity, the quotes for the treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If "Reuters Page FEDCMT" is the specified CMT Reuters Page in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing
 
Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," as such yield is displayed on Reuters on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Reuters Page FEDCMT CMT Rate cannot be determined as described in the preceding sentence:
     a. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities."
     b. If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls.
     c. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the index maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a remaining term to maturity of no more than one year shorter than such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.
     d. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the calculation agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotation shall be eliminated.
 
     e. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such CMT Rate interest determination date of three reference dealers selected by the calculation agent from five such reference dealers selected by the calculation agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement, a remaining term to maturity closest to such index maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the index maturity specified in the applicable pricing supplement have remaining terms to maturity equally close to such index maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the calculation agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate determination date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.
     . Commercial Paper Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period at an interest rate equal to the Commercial Paper Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, as specified in such Commercial Paper Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
     The "Commercial Paper Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the money market yield (as defined below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the related pricing supplement, as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial" prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date.
     The calculation agent will observe the following procedures if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the money market yield of the rate on that Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the Pricing Supplement, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Commercial Paper  Nonfinancial."
     (II) If that rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the
 
calculation agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the money market yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the index maturity described in the pricing supplement placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized securities rating organization. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (III) If fewer than three dealers selected by the calculation agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     "Money Market Yield" shall be a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
where "D" refers to the applicable annual rate for the commercial paper, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which the interest is being calculated.
     . Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes will bear interest for each interest reset period based on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and any Spread and/or Spread Multiplier and will be subject to the minimum interest rate or the maximum interest rate, if any, specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes
     Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate on the applicable Interest Determination Date equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the interest determination date as displayed under the caption "11TH DIST COFI" on Reuters Page COFI/ARMS. "Reuters Page COFI/ARMS" means the display page designated as page COFI/ARMS on Reuters, or any successor service or page, for the purpose of displaying the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District, as of 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on such Interest Determination Date.
     The following procedures will be followed if the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate cannot be determined as described above:
     (I) If the above rate is not displayed on the applicable Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index on the applicable Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of San Francisco fails to announce the rate for the calendar month next preceding the applicable Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the new interest reset period will be the same as for the
 
immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index will be the initial interest rate.
     (III) The "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate index" will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that the FHLB of San Francisco most recently announced as the cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the applicable Interest Determination Date.
     .

     (I) EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euro having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, beginning on the second TARGET Business Day after such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR 01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone interbank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent: euro deposits having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in a representative amount. The calculation agent will request that the principal euro-zone office of each of these banks provide a quotation of its rate.

     (III) If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading euro-zone banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on that EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the euro-zone selected by the calculation agent: loans of euro having such EURIBOR Index Maturity, beginning on such
 
EURIBOR Interest Reset Date, and in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in euro in that market at the time.
     If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, EURIBOR for the new interest period will be EURIBOR in effect for the prior interest period. If the initial Base Rate has been in effect for the prior interest period, however, it will remain in effect for the new interest period.

("Bloomberg"), which is the Fed Funds Opening Rate as reported by Prebon Yamane (or a successor) on Bloomberg. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page 5 or is not displayed on FFPREBON Index page on Bloomberg or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the calculation agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in New York City (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the calculation agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; provided, however, that if the brokers so selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date without giving effect to any resetting of the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.

The calculation agent will select the four banks and request the principal London office of each of those banks to provide a quotation of its rate for deposits in the LIBOR currency. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
     (II) If fewer than two quotations are provided as mentioned above, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in the principal financial center selected by the calculation agent at approximately 11:00 a.m. in the applicable principal financial center, on the Interest Determination Date for loans to leading European banks in the LIBOR currency having the index maturity designated in the pricing supplement and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the LIBOR currency in that market at that time.

     (I) If the rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on USPRIME1 as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date.
     (II) If at least one rate but fewer than four rates appear on USPRIME1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted (on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date by three major money center banks in the City of New York selected by the calculation agent.
     (III) If the banks selected by the calculation agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate then in effect on the Interest Determination Date.

     The "Treasury Rate" for any Interest Determination Date is the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("treasury bills") having the index maturity specified in such Pricing Supplement under the caption "INVEST RATE" on the display on Reuters page USAUCTION10 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date for that Interest Determination Date.
     The calculation agent will follow the following procedures if the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
     (I) If the rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date, the Treasury Rate will be the bond equivalent yield (as defined below) of the auction rate of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/ Treasury Bills/ Auction High."
     (II) If the rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the calculation date and cannot be determined as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Treasury Rate will be the bond equivalent yield of the auction rate of such Treasury Bills as otherwise announced by the United States Department of Treasury.

     (IV) If such rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related calculation date, then the calculation agent will determine the Treasury Rate to be the bond equivalent yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date of three leading primary U.S. government securities dealers (which may include the Agents or their affiliates) for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the index maturity described in the related Pricing Supplement. The calculation agent will select the three dealers referred to above.
     (V) If fewer than three dealers selected by the calculation agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Treasury Rate will remain the Treasury Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.

Examples of indexed items that the Company may use include a published stock index, the common stock price of a publicly traded company, the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese Yen, or the price in a particular market of a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude oil. The amount of interest and principal that will be paid will depend on the structure of the Indexed Note and the level of the specified indexed item throughout the term of the Indexed Note and at maturity. Specific information pertaining to the method of determining the interest payments and the principal amount will be described in the applicable Pricing Supplement, as well as additional risk factors unique to the Indexed Note, certain historical information for the specified indexed item and certain additional United States federal tax considerations.

The "Amortized Face Amount" of an Original Issue Discount Note shall be the amount equal to the sum of (a) the Issue Price (as set forth on the face of such Original Issue Discount Note) plus (b) the aggregate of the portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of such Original Issue Discount Note within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), whether denominated as principal or interest, over the Issue Price of Original Issue Discount Note) which shall theretofore have accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section 1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the date of issue of Original Issue Discount Note to the date of determination, minus (c) any amount considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of such Original Issue Discount Note which has been paid on such Original Issue Discount Note from the date of issue to the date of
 
determination. In no event can the Amortized Face Amount exceed the principal amount of such Note due at the stated maturity thereof.

     (13) Foreign Currency Notes will be paid in U.S. dollars converted from the Specified Currency unless a Holder of Foreign Currency Notes elects to be paid in the Specified Currency or unless the applicable Pricing Supplement provides otherwise. In the case of a Note having a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the principal of that Note in U.S. dollars will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by an agent specified in the applicable pricing supplement (the "exchange rate agent") at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the exchange rate agent) selected by the exchange rate agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all holders of Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations are not available, the Company will make payments in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the holders of the Foreign Currency Note by deductions from such payments. Unless indicated otherwise in the applicable Pricing Supplement, a holder of Foreign Currency Notes may elect to receive payment of the principal of and interest on the Foreign Currency Notes in the Specified Currency by transmitting a written request for such payment to the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of New York on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to maturity, as the case may be. A Holder may make this request in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by facsimile transmission. A Holder of a Foreign Currency note may elect to receive payment in the Specified Currency for all principal and interest payments and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such Holder's election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the maturity date, as the case may be. If a Specified Currency is not available for the payment of principal, premium or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of Foreign Currency Notes by making such payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of the specified currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "market exchange rate") as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second business day prior to such payment or, if not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate or as otherwise indicated in an applicable Pricing Supplement. All determinations referred to above made by the exchange rate agent will
 
be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of clear error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holders of the Foreign Currency Notes.
     (15) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes shall be subject to the events of default specified in Section 501, paragraphs (1) through (3) of the Indenture.
     (16) Each Note will be represented by either a master global note or a global note in fully registered form (each a "Global Note") registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository (each such Note represented by a Global Note being herein referred to as a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive registered form, without coupons (a "Certificated Note"), as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, The Depository Trust Company will act as Depositary. Except as provided in Section 305 of the Indenture, Book-Entry Notes will not be issuable in certificated form and will not be exchangeable or transferable. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Note, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Book-Entry Note or Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes.
     (18) Interest will be payable to the person in whose name a Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined below) next preceding each Interest Payment Date (as defined below); provided, however, that interest payable at maturity or upon redemption will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable.
     (19) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes shall be defeasible pursuant to Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture.
     (22) The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in making payments in immediately available funds, but, except as otherwise provided under Additional Amounts in the applicable Pricing Supplement, any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holders of the Notes in respect of which such payments are made.
     (25) The Notes shall be subject to the subordination provisions contained in Article Sixteen of the Indenture. Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the resolutions and authorization referred to in the first paragraph hereof, the Notes shall have such other terms (which may be in addition to or different from the terms set forth herein) as are specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

Treasury bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction falls on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date will instead be the first Business Day immediately following the auction sale.

If the Stated Maturity falls on a day which is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Stated Maturity will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Stated Maturity, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable as a result of such delayed payment. If an Interest Payment Date other than the Stated Maturity falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and interest will accrue for the period of such postponement (except if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR, and such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be advanced to the immediately preceding London Business Day or TARGET Business Day, respectively), it being understood that, to the extent this sentence is inconsistent with Section 112 of the Indenture, the provisions of this sentence shall apply in lieu of such Section.
     Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the interest period or from the date from which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day (1) by 360, if the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, EURIBOR, Federal Funds Rate, Prime Rate, LIBOR, CMS Rate or Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate (as described below), or (2) by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the Treasury Rate or CMT Rate. The interest rate applicable to any day that is an Interest Reset Date is the interest rate as determined, in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth, with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate, as set forth on the face hereof).
     All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation with respect hereto will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 7.123455% (or 0.07123455) being rounded to 7.12346% (or 0.0712346) and 7.123454% (or 0.07123454) being rounded to 7.12345% (or 0.0712345)). All currency amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit (with five one-thousandths of a unit being rounded upward).
     Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, with respect to each Interest Determination Date, the rate of interest shall be the rate determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
 
     . If the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the CD Rate, this Security will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the CD Rate, plus or minus any Spread, and/or multiplied by any Spread Multiplier, and subject to the Minimum Interest Rate and the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, set forth on the face hereof.

     Section 3. . Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof, the following provisions of this Section 3 shall apply to the calculation of interest on this Security. If the first Interest Reset Date is later than the Original Issue Date, this Security will bear interest from its Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date (as defined below) at the Initial Interest Rate set forth on the face hereof. Thereafter, the interest rate hereon for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof, as adjusted by the Spread, the Spread Multiplier or other formula, if any, set forth on the face hereof.
Interest Rate Calculations
     As set forth on the face hereof, this Security may also have either or both of the following: (i) a maximum limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any Interest Reset Period (""); and (ii) a minimum limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any Interest Reset Period ("").

If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is LIBOR or EURIBOR, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding London Business Day or TARGET Business Day, respectively.

If the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the Treasury Rate, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for this Security will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the same index maturity are auctioned. Treasury bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is usually held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next week. If an auction falls on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date will instead be the first Business Day immediately following the auction sale.
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index
     Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof, the "," where applicable, pertaining to an Interest Determination Date is the earlier of (i) the 10th calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity, as the case may be.
Calculation Date
     The Company will appoint and enter into an agreement with an agent (a "") to calculate the rate of interest on the Securities of this series which bear interest at a floating rate. Unless otherwise set forth on the face hereof, KeyBank National Association will be the Calculation Agent. At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next succeeding Interest Reset Date.
Calculation Agent
     Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the interest rate thereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, shown on the face hereof. In addition, the interest rate hereon shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
     Interest will be payable on, unless specifically set forth on the face hereof, if this Security resets (i) daily, weekly or monthly, the third Wednesday of each month or the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year, as set forth on the face hereof unless if the Base Rate is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate; (ii) monthly and the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, then the first calendar day of each month as set forth on the face hereof; (iii) quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; (iv) semiannually, the third Wednesday of each of the
 
two months set forth on the face hereof; and (v) annually, the third Wednesday of the month set forth on the face hereof (each, an ""), and in each case, on the Maturity Date or at redemption or repurchase.
Interest Payment Date
     The interest payable hereon on each Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date or the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. If the Stated Maturity falls on a day which is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Stated Maturity will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Stated Maturity, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable as a result of such delayed payment. If an Interest Payment Date other than the Stated Maturity falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and interest will accrue for the period of such postponement (except if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR, and such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be advanced to the immediately preceding London Business Day or TARGET Business Day, respectively), it being understood that, to the extent this sentence is inconsistent with Section 112 of the Indenture, the provisions of this sentence shall apply in lieu of such Section.
