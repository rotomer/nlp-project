Section 8  Other Events
 
On June 29, 2011, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approved Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, by adopting a final rule as well as a related interim final rule (the "Regulation"). The Regulation limits debit card issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions, and implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The Regulation reduces the maximum allowable interchange fee per transaction to: $.21, plus a fraud allowance of five (5) basis points on the transaction value, and provides, through the interim final rule, for an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements. If interchange fees are set at the maximum amount allowed by the Regulation and we receive the fraud adjustment amount, we estimate that the impact on our debit interchange revenue stream will be an annualized decline of approximately $50 million to $60 million before any potential offsets from other fees or charges that may be implemented. The relevant portions of the Regulation are not effective until October 1, 2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
