On September 1, 2011, KeyCorp submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for each trust listed below, which will result in the redemption of the trust preferred securities identified below on the redemption date specified for each security. The trust preferred securities will be redeemed at the redemption price of $1,000 per trust preferred security plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines, upon notice of redemption, these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 Capital for KeyCorp. These redemptions are consistent with the updated capital plan KeyCorp submitted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The redemptions will be funded with existing available cash.
