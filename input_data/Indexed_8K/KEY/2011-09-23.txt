This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by KeyCorp with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 20, 2011 (the "Original 8-K") to update "Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders" in the Original 8-K regarding the results from KeyCorp's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 19, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose our decision regarding how frequently we will conduct a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. No other changes have been made to the Original 8-K.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
At the 2011 Annual Meeting, KeyCorp's shareholders recommended, in a non-binding advisory vote, that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement, on an annual basis. Accordingly, in light of this recommendation and other factors considered by the Board of Directors (the "Board"), the Board has determined that we will hold a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement on an annual basis until the Board otherwise determines that a different frequency for such advisory votes is in the best interest of KeyCorp.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
