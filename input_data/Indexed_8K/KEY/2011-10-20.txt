FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CLEVELAND, October 20, 2011  KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced third quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $229 million, or $.24 per common share. Key's third quarter 2011 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $163 million, or $.19 per common share, for the third quarter of 2010. The results for the third quarter of 2011 reflect an improvement in noninterest expense and lower credit costs from the same period one year ago. Third quarter 2011 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $212 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $178 million for the same quarter one year ago.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $656 million, or $.71 per common share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $121 million, or $.14 per common share, for the same period one year ago. Net income attributable to Key common shareholders for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, was $619 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $111 million for the same period one year ago.
During the third quarter of 2011, the Company continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Nonperforming loans decreased by $584 million and nonperforming assets declined by $887 million from the year-ago quarter to $788 million and $914 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined to $109 million, or .90% of average loan balances for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $357 million, or 2.69% of average loan balances for the same period one year ago.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Beth Mooney stated, "Our financial results demonstrate consistent positive momentum for Key as we continue executing our relationship strategy, improving credit quality and maintaining disciplined expense control. We are also pleased that our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio grew for the second consecutive quarter. Our clients continue to benefit from our ability to work together across business lines to deliver value by combining local knowledge and service with specialized industry expertise and advisory capabilities."
Mooney continued: "We look forward to continuing our support of small- and medium-sized businesses and have committed $5 billion in lending capital over the next three years to foster growth and expansion in this important segment."
At September 30, 2011, Key's estimated Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 11.34% and 13.55%, compared to 11.14% and 13.93%, respectively, at June 30, 2011.
The Company originated approximately $9.7 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the quarter.

Results of Operations
 
 
SUMMARY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $555 million for the third quarter of 2011, and the net interest margin was 3.09%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $647 million and a net interest margin of 3.35% for the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest income is attributable to both a decline in earning assets and tighter spread between asset yields and funding costs.
Compared to the second quarter of 2011, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $15 million, and the net interest margin declined 10 basis points. The decline in the net interest margin and net interest income reflects a higher level of lower yielding short-term investments. The unfavorable impact of the shift in asset mix was partially offset by rate reductions on deposits, maturities of higher rate certificates of deposit, and the impact of the redemptions on September 1, 2011, of certain capital securities.
Key's noninterest income was $483 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $486 million for the year-ago quarter. Compared to the same period one year ago, investment banking and capital markets income decreased $17 million, operating lease income declined $11 million and corporate-owned life insurance income decreased $8 million due to a $12 million dividend recognized in the third quarter of 2010. Letter of credit and loan fees also decreased $6 million from one year ago. These declines were offset by increases of $16 million in net gains (losses) from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) and $24 million in other income, which included a $13 million gain associated with the redemption of certain capital securities.

The major components of Key's noninterest income for the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Noninterest Income  Major Components
 
Compared to the second quarter of 2011, noninterest income increased by $29 million. The increase was a result of higher net gains (losses) from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) of $17 million and other income of $15 million which included a $13 million gain associated with the redemption of certain capital securities. Also contributing to the improvement in noninterest income were increases of $8 million in letter of credit and loan fees, $7 million in net gains (losses) from loan sales and $5 million in service charges on deposit accounts. These increases were partially offset by decreases in investment banking and capital markets income of $17 million and trust and investment services income of $6 million.
Key's noninterest expense was $692 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $736 million for the same period last year. The improvement in expense levels resulted from declines of $20 million in FDIC deposit insurance premiums, $17 million in operating lease expense, and $28 million in various other miscellaneous expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million increase in personnel expense, which included a $10 million increase to pension expense.
Compared to the second quarter of 2011, noninterest expense increased by $12 million, primarily as a result of an $11 million decrease in the credit for losses on lending-related commitments. Marketing expense also increased $6 million as Key continues to promote, support and advertise relationship-based products, services and capabilities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in various miscellaneous expenses.
ASSET QUALITY
Key's provision for loan and lease losses was a charge of $10 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to a charge of $94 million for the year-ago quarter and a credit of $8 million for the second quarter of 2011. Key's allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.1 billion, or 2.35% of total period-end loans, at September 30, 2011, compared to 2.57% at June 30, 2011, and 3.81% at September 30, 2010.

Selected asset quality statistics for Key for each of the past five quarters are presented in the following table.
Selected Asset Quality Statistics from Continuing Operations
 
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $109 million, or .90% of average loans. These results compare to $357 million, or 2.69%, for the same period last year and $134 million, or 1.11%, for the previous quarter. Net loan charge-offs have declined for the last seven consecutive quarters. For the first time since the first quarter of 2008, the percentage of net loan charge-offs to average loans is less than one percent.
Key's net loan charge-offs by loan type for each of the past five quarters are shown in the following table.
Net Loan Charge-offs from Continuing Operations
 
Compared to the second quarter of 2011, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $18 million which was primarily attributable to a decline in the real estate  construction and commercial, financial and agricultural categories. As shown in the table on page 6, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $27 million, or 24.8%, of Key's total net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2011. Net charge-offs in the exit loan portfolio increased by $2 million from the second quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the marine loan portfolio.
At September 30, 2011, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $788 million and represented 1.64% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.76% at June 30, 2011, and 2.67% at September 30, 2010. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2011, totaled $914

million and represented 1.89% of portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 1.98% at June 30, 2011, and 3.48% at September 30, 2010. The following table illustrates the trend in Key's nonperforming assets by loan type over the past five quarters.
Nonperforming Assets from Continuing Operations
 
 
Nonperforming assets continued to decrease during the third quarter of 2011, representing the eighth consecutive quarterly decline. As shown in the following table, Key's exit loan portfolio accounted for $119 million, or 13.0%, of Key's total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2011.
The following table shows the composition of Key's exit loan portfolio at September 30, 2011, and June 30, 2011, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the second and third quarters of 2011, and the nonperforming status of these loans at September 30, 2011, and June 30, 2011.

CAPITAL
Key's estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all "well-capitalized" regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2011.
Capital Ratios
 
 
As shown in the preceding table, at September 30, 2011, Key's estimated Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 11.34% and 13.55%, respectively. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 9.82% at September 30, 2011.
Based upon current expectations and subject to Key's regulators issuance of the final capital planning guidelines, the Company expects its capital planning process to include assessment of certain capital distributions, including potential dividend increases and share repurchases.
The changes in Key's outstanding common shares over the past five quarters are summarized in the following table.
Summary of Changes in Common Shares Outstanding
 
During the first quarter of 2011, Key successfully completed a $625 million common equity offering and a $1 billion debt offering. The proceeds from the equity and debt offerings, along with other available funds, were used to repurchase the $2.5 billion of Fixed-Rate Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B issued to the U.S. Treasury Department as a result of Key's participation in the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program.

Key Community Bank Summary of Operations
Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $58 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of $53 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses and noninterest expense were partially offset by lower net interest income in the third quarter of 2011.
KeyCorp Reports Third Quarter 2011 Results

Page 9
 
Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $32 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2010. Average earning assets decreased by $557 million, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $1 billion, or 2%, as higher-costing certificates of deposit matured, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.
Noninterest income increased by $1 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher income from electronic banking fees and letter of credit and loan fees. This was partially offset by lower insurance income.
The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $36 million, or 48%, compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans from the same period one year ago.
Noninterest expense declined by $3 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in FDIC deposit insurance premiums of $18 million, partially offset by increases in personnel expense and real estate costs associated with investments in Key's branch network.
Key Corporate Bank
 
TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful
Key Corporate Bank Summary of Operations
Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $122 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of $134 million for the same period one year ago. This decline was driven by lower net interest income and investment banking and capital markets income. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by a significant decline in noninterest expense. The provision for loan and lease losses also decreased as net charge-offs significantly declined between periods.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $29 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2010, due to lower average deposits and average earning assets. Average deposits declined by $1 billion, or 9%, from one year ago primarily as a result of the movement of $1.5 billion in escrow balances out of the Real Estate Capital line of business to a third party in the first quarter of 2011. Average earning assets decreased by $2.9 billion, or 13%, from the

year-ago quarter, while lower levels of nonperforming assets and better pricing helped to partially offset volume-related declines.
Noninterest income declined by $27 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2010. Contributing to the decline in noninterest income was the impact from a slowing merger and acquisition market and the third quarter volatility in the capital markets, which resulted in a decrease in investment banking and capital markets income of $18 million. In addition, letter of credit and loan fees and operating lease revenue both decreased $7 million from the year-ago quarter. These declines were partially offset by improvements in gains on leased equipment of $5 million and mortgage banking fees of $3 million.
The provision for loan and lease losses in the third quarter of 2011 was a credit of $40 million compared to a credit of $25 million for the same period one year ago. Key Corporate Bank continued to experience improved asset quality for the eighth quarter in a row.
Noninterest expense decreased by $21 million, or 9%, from the third quarter of 2010. Contributing to the improvement in expense levels were decreases in operating lease expense of $7 million, corporate support costs of $5 million, and various other miscellaneous expense items of $11 million. Personnel expense also declined $4 million as a result of lower investment banking and capital markets income. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments of $5 million.
Other Segments
Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key's Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $55 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of $17 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses of $34 million in the exit portfolio.

The table below presents the computations of certain financial measures related to "tangible common equity," "Tier 1 common equity" and "pre-provision net revenue." The tangible common equity ratio has become a focus of some investors, and management believes that this ratio may assist investors in analyzing Key's capital position absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders' equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Key's capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, management believes it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Key's capital adequacy on these same bases. The table also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.
The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of provision for loan and lease losses facilitates the analysis of results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, Key has procedures in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components, and to ensure that Key's performance is properly reflected to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
