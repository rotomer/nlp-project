Item 8.01 Other Events
On October 31, 2011, KeyCorp submitted a redemption notice to the property trustee for KeyCorp Capital IX, which will result in the redemption of approximately $331 million enhanced trust preferred securities identified below on the redemption date specified for such securities. The enhanced trust preferred securities will be redeemed at the redemption price of $25 per enhanced trust preferred security plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines, upon notice of redemption, these enhanced trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 Capital for KeyCorp. These redemptions are consistent with the updated capital plan KeyCorp submitted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The redemptions will be funded with available cash.
