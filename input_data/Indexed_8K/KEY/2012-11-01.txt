KeyCorp's actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in KeyCorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, each of which have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are available on Key's website (
