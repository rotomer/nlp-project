The Company expects to resolve all of the rejected Kmart stores before June 30, 2003. Kimco has continued to expand its shopping center investment portfolio through joint ventures and selectively in the parent REIT portfolio. Since March 31, 2002, the Company has acquired interests in 33 shopping centers for an aggregate cost of approximately $385.4 million as follows:
- - Kimco increased its Canadian portfolio by acquiring interests in 9 properties totaling 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area for an aggregate cost of $195.1 million (C$304.8 million) through its joint venture with RioCan REIT. Five shopping centers located in Ontario were purchased for approximately $61.4 million (C$98.1 million), two shopping centers in British Columbia were acquired for $69.8 million (C$108.1 million) and two shopping centers in Alberta were purchased for $63.9 million (C$98.6 million). Kimco's joint venture with RioCan has grown to 18 properties in four provinces totaling 4.3 million square feet of gross leasable area. Kimco owns a 50% interest in the 98.4 percent leased portfolio. Additionally, the venture has 17 projects totaling 4.5 million square feet under contract to purchase totaling $280 million (C$400 million). Walmart is the largest tenant in these pending transactions. - - Kimco Retail Opportunity Fund (KROP), a joint venture in which Kimco owns a 20 percent interest, completed its previously announced acquisition of shopping centers from The Rouse Company. In July, KROP acquired an additional shopping center property for this portfolio in Arlington, Texas for $9.3 million. - - The Company acquired seven former Service Merchandise locations in a joint venture and has signed leases for the vacancies at six sites and leases for the seventh are in negotiation.

The project, acquired for $26.5 million, is located in New Jersey and is anchored by a Safeway, Target and T.J. Maxx. As of June 30, 2002, KIR consisted of 66 shopping centers totaling 12.7 million square feet in 20 states. The portfolio is 96.9% leased. - - In the parent REIT portfolio, Kimco acquired a vacant former Home Quarters site for $4.3 million and has signed leases with Bed Bath & Beyond, Borders Books and Marshalls for redevelopment of the shopping center. Kimco owns 100% of the investment. - - In separate transactions, Kimco's preferred equity business acquired interests in two shopping centers for an aggregate investment of $6.4 million. Kimco's complimentary business lines also made substantial new investments and commitments: - - Kimco's Retail Property Solutions business continued to find opportunities to provide capital to retailers secured by their leased and fee-owned real estate. The Company is participating in a joint venture that acquired designation rights to 54 former Kmart locations for approximately $43 million. In a separate joint venture, the Company agreed to purchase eight properties from Ames Department Stores for approximately $59.0 million. Seven of the sites are leased to Ames and one of the sites is subleased to Wegmans. - - Kimco Developers, Inc. (KDI), the Company's merchant building business, acquired two projects for development during the quarter for an aggregate cost of $4.1 million. KDI's development pipeline consists of 19 projects with potential gross leasable area in excess of 5.5 million square feet. The Company invested $39.1 million in these projects during the quarter.
Additionally, Kimco's pipeline for potential new investments remains robust. The Company's joint venture proposal to acquire Konover Property Trust was accepted by Konover's Board of Directors.

Konover Property Trust owns and operates 36 shopping centers, most of them anchored by grocery stores, throughout the U.S. Southeast. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 35 years.
