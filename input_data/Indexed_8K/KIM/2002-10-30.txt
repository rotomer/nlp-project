[LETTERHEAD OF KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 28, 2002 KIMCO REPORTS THIRD QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND NEW HYDE PARK, NY October 28, 2002-- Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM), the nation's largest owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers, today announced that third quarter net income for the period ended September 30, 2002, increased 2.5 percent to $60.8 million from $59.3 million for the same period last year. Third quarter net income per diluted common share (EPS) was $0.53 versus $0.54 per diluted common share a year ago. Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, rose 6.1 percent to $78.9 million, from $74.3 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per common share basis, FFO matched the prior year amount of $0.75. FFO for the third quarter 2002 excludes gains on sales of operating properties of approximately $1.0 million or $0.01 per diluted common share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, net income increased 4.6 percent to $182.7 million from $174.7 million for the same period last year. Net income per diluted common share was $1.60, equaling the results for the same period in the previous year. Funds from operations rose 9.5 percent to $237.0 million for the nine-month period from $216.5 million in the year earlier period. On a diluted per common share basis, funds from operations increased 1.8 percent to $2.25 from $2.21 reported a year ago. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 excludes gains on sales of operating properties of $1.5 million or $0.01 per diluted common share and $3.0 million or $0.03 per diluted common share for the same period last year. Leasing activity in the Company's core portfolio of shopping centers was strong during the third quarter, resulting in 126 new leases executed totaling 1.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, including the lease up of more than 500,000 square feet of vacancy created by retailer bankruptcies. As a result, the Company experienced positive absorption of space of 467,000 square feet and portfolio occupancy increased 0.9 percent to 85.9 percent. In addition, the Company has transactions pending on approximately 1.7 million square feet of space formerly occupied by Kmart. Kimco Developers, Inc. (KDI), the Company's merchant building business recorded pre-tax gains of $4.9 million from the sale of its Cedar Hill Crossing project, in Cedar Hill, Texas, its Wakefield Crossing project in Raleigh, North Carolina and a parcel at its project in San Antonio, Texas. KDI's merchant building pipeline consists of 18 projects with potential gross leasable area in excess of 5.1 million square feet. During the quarter, the Company invested an additional $31.9 million in these projects.
Kimco's management confirmed that the current First Call consensus estimate for FFO per share in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $0.78 is achievable and that consensus estimates for the full-year ending 2002 of $3.03 is also within its range of guidance. Management estimates net income will be $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2002 and $2.15 per share for the full-year. Furthermore, management provided guidance for FFO per share in 2003 of between $3.13 and $3.23 per share, and estimates net income in 2003 will be between $2.21 and $2.29 per share. Dividend Increase Kimco's Board of Directors approved a common stock dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend payable per common share to $0.54 from the current quarterly level of $0.52 per common share. Kimco has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, from an initial annual rate of $0.78 per share (adjusted for stock splits) in 1992 to the current annual rate of $2.16 per share. This level of increase is consistent with the Company's objective of maintaining a conservative dividend payout ratio while providing shareholders a growing source of income. The Board declared the first quarterly dividend at the increased rate payable on January 15, 2003 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2003. Investment Activity Kimco has continued to expand its shopping center investment portfolio. Since June 30, 2002, the Company has acquired investment interests in 30 shopping centers and three parcels of land for development, with an aggregate cost of approximately $551.8 million. This amount includes the recently announced Westlake property transaction. Highlights of the Company's investment activities are as follows: - Kimco acquired interests in 11 shopping centers totaling 3.0 million square feet of gross leasable area and three development projects through its Canadian joint venture with RioCan REIT for an aggregate cost of USD$211.3 million. Kimco's joint venture with RioCan has grown to 30 properties in five provinces totaling 6.9 million square feet of gross leasable area. Kimco owns a 50% interest in the 97.1 percent leased portfolio. - Kimco Retail Opportunity Fund (KROP), an entity that Kimco manages and owns a 20 percent interest, acquired four shopping centers for an aggregate cost of $53.1 million. This portfolio now consists of 13 shopping centers totaling 1.3 million square feet. - The Company acquired two shopping centers for the Kimco Income REIT (KIR), a joint venture with institutional investors, which Kimco manages and owns a 43.3 percent interest. The properties were purchased for $113.8 million in separate transactions. KIR also sold a property in Aurora, Illinois for $2.4 million. KIR now consists of 67 shopping centers totaling 13.5 million square feet in 21 states. The portfolio is approximately 97.4% leased. - In separate transactions, Kimco's preferred equity business acquired interests in five properties for an aggregate investment of $17.1 million. Kimco's preferred equity program provides capital for shopping center owners where Kimco generates a preferred rate of return.
- Kimco purchased two grocery-anchored shopping centers located in Northeast Mexico. Planigrupo, one of the largest retail leasing and development companies in Mexico, will manage the properties. Plaza Real Saltillo is a recently developed 174,000 square foot shopping center, anchored by a 74,000 square foot HEB grocery store located in Saltillo, Mexico. The property was acquired for $22.9 million. Plaza Real Sendero Norte is a 109,000 square foot shopping center anchored by a 98,000 square foot HEB grocery store located in Monterrey, Mexico. Kimco purchased additional land for the development of Phase II of this property. The completed shopping center and additional land for development was acquired for $12.8 million. - A Kimco-led group has received approval from the bankruptcy court to provide Ames Department Stores with a $100 million secured revolving credit facility for capital to facilitate its liquidation. Under the agreement, Kimco will earn fees and interest at a fixed rate, and in addition, has the opportunity to earn additional interest based on the disposition of real estate assets by Ames. This new facility, which is collateralized by the leased and fee owned real estate assets of Ames, will replace the existing DIP financing provided by Kimco. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 35 years. Kimco owns and operates the nation's largest portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers with interests in 569 properties comprising approximately 79.0 million square feet of leasable space located throughout 41 states, Canada and Mexico.
