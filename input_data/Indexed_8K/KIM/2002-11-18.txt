TOWER 10 452 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK, NY 10018 WACHOVIA SECURITIES, INC. 301 SOUTH COLLEGE STREET, DC-8 CHARLOTTE, NC 28288 Ladies and Gentlemen: Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company") hereby agrees with Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Fleet Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Wachovia Securities, Inc., each as an agent of the Company (collectively, the "Placement Agents"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of, and the solicitation by the Placement Agents on behalf of the Company of offers to purchase, $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.961% Senior Notes due November 30, 2007 (the "Notes") to the Core Investment Grade Bond Trust I (the "Trust"). The Notes are to be issued under an indenture dated as of September 1, 1993, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 4, 1994, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 7, 1995 and as further amended or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture") between the Company and Bank of New York (as successor by merger to IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company), as trustee (the
"Trustee"). The Company hereby appoints the Placement Agents as its exclusive agents for the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes from the Company by the Trust, and each Placement Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company shall not appoint any other entity or person to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that no Placement Agent shall be obligated, under any circumstance, to purchase Notes from the Company, as principal or otherwise. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein specified, each Placement Agent, acting solely as an agent of the Company, will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers from the Trust for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes from the Company specified opposite its name in Schedule A attached hereto. Each Placement Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer for the purchase of Notes it has solicited on an agency basis. In the event that a Placement Agent orally communicates to the Company that it has received an offer for the purchase of Notes at a price at least equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, then the Company shall accept such offer in whole, provided that the aggregate of all such offers does not exceed $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by a Placement Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company or fails to satisfy any condition to its issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder, the Company shall (i) hold such Placement Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from, or as a result of, such default or failure and (ii) pay to such Placement Agent the commission to which it would otherwise be entitled absent such default or failure. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") registration statements on Form S-3 (333-61303 and 333-59970) for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, and certain of the Company's equity securities and warrants to purchase such equity securities, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statements (including all pre-effective amendments thereto) have been declared effective by the Commission, the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may have been required prior to the execution of this Agreement and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act. Such registration statements (as so amended, if applicable), including all information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, are collectively referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the final prospectus and the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), in the form first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act Regulations, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to the execution of this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other 2
information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (and all other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be. If the Company files a registration statement with the Commission to register a portion of the Notes and relies on Rule 462(b) for such registration statement to become effective upon filing with the Commission (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference to "Registration Statement" herein shall be deemed to be to both the registration statements referred to above (333-61303 and 333-59970) and the Rule 462 Registration Statement.

(b) The Company will notify each Placement Agent immediately, and confirm such notice in writing (only if written notice is requested by the Placement Agents) as soon as reasonably practicable, of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any Prospectus Supplement or other supplement or amendment to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (v) any change in or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any long-term debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review its rating of any long-term debt securities of the Company, and (vi) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; and the Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. (c) At any time when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company will give each Placement Agent notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, 1934 Act or otherwise (including any revised prospectus which the Company proposes for use by the Placement Agents in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement first becomes effective, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, or any abbreviated term sheet prepared in reliance on Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations), and will furnish each Placement Agent with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed or used a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form to which counsel for the Placement Agents shall reasonably object. (d) The Company will deliver to each Placement Agent as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as each Placement Agent reasonably requests. (e) The Company will furnish to each Placement Agent, from time to time during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 11
Act or the 1934 Act in connection with issuance and sale of the Notes, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as each Placement Agent may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the 1934 Act Regulations. (f) If at any time when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Placement Agents or counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, then the Company will promptly prepare and, subject to Section 4(c) file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement and Prospectus comply with such requirements. (g) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with each Placement Agent, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws and real estate syndication laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as each Placement Agent may designate; and in each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for so long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified.

(k) The Company will not, between the date hereof and the Closing Time, without the prior written consent of each Placement Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company with a maturity 12

(v) Each of the partnership and joint venture agreements to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, and which relates to real property described in the Prospectus, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such applicable party and constitutes the valid agreement thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy and general equitable principles and the execution, delivery and performance of any of such agreements did not, at the time of execution and delivery, and does not constitute a breach of, or default under, the charter or by-laws of such party or any material contract, lease or other instrument to which such party is a party or by which its properties may be bound or any law, administrative regulation or administrative or court order or decree.

which are specified by the Placement Agents, and have found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.

Section 7. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Placement Agent and each person, if any, who controls each Placement Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows: (1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission, or alleged omission therefrom, of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any 20
claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission referred to in subsection (1) above, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (3) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Placement Agents), as incurred, which was reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Placement Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or made in reliance upon the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; provided, further, that with respect to any preliminary prospectus, such indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Placement Agent (or the benefit of any person controlling such Placement Agent) if the person asserting any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses purchased the Notes which are the subject thereof through such Placement Agent and if such person was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated therein by reference) at or prior to confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such person in any case where such sending or giving is required by the 1933 Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and the Prospectus was delivered to such Placement Agent a reasonable amount of time prior to the date of delivery of such confirmation. (b) Each Placement Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Placement Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, 21
an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Section 8. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 7 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Placement Agents with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the Placement Agents in respect of such offering, as incurred, in such proportions that the Placement Agents are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the commission received by such Placement Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of the Notes and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Placement Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total commission received by such Placement Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which such Placement Agent has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses. The Placement Agents' obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 shall be several in the same proportion specified in Schedule A attached hereto with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose offer to purchase is to be solicited by each Placement Agent. For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls a Placement Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Placement Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. 22
Section 9. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, or investigation made by or on behalf of any Placement Agent or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes by the Trust. Section 10. Termination of Agreement. (a) The Placement Agents may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Placement Agents, impracticable or inadvisable to solicit offers for the Notes, or (iii) trading in any of the securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or the Nasdaq National Market or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by Federal, New York or Maryland authorities, or (iv) there has occurred a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services, or (v) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any long-term debt securities of the Company as of the date hereof shall have been lowered or withdrawn since such date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced, since the date hereof, that it has any long-term debt securities of the Company under surveillance or review. (b) In the event of any such termination, (x) the covenants set forth in Section 4 with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes shall remain in effect so long as the Placement Agents are required to deliver a Prospectus in respect of sales of the Notes and (y) the covenant set forth in Section 4(h) hereof, the provisions of Section 5 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 7 and 8 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 9 and 13 hereof shall remain in effect.
