(c) Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the office of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, 20th Floor, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company, at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the fifth business day (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof) following the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or at such other time as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company (each such time and date being referred to as a "Closing Time"). In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Securities are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates representing, such Option Securities, shall be made at the above-mentioned office of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by you and the Company on each Date of Delivery as specified in the notice from you to the Company. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer or certified or official bank check or checks in Federal or similar same-day funds payable to the order of the Company against delivery to you for the respective accounts of the Underwriters for the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by them. The Underwritten Securities shall be in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as you may request in writing at least one business day prior to the applicable Closing Time or Date of Delivery, as the case may be. The Underwritten Securities, which may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by you on or before the first business day prior to the Closing Time or the Date of Delivery, as the case may be. If authorized by the applicable Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Underwritten Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto with such changes therein as the Company may approve. As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to you at Closing Time, for the respective accounts of the Underwriters, a fee equal to that percentage of the principal amount of Underwritten Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at the Closing Time as is specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types described in the Prospectus. At the Closing Time, the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum principal amount of Underwritten Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the applicable Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities in excess of that specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. 11
You shall submit to the Company, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the Company will advise you, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, of the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract. The principal amount of Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by the several Underwriters pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be reduced by the principal amount of Underwritten Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by you to the Company; provided, however, that the total principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the total amount of Underwritten Securities covered by the applicable Terms Agreement, less the principal amount of Underwritten Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts. Section 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with you and with each Underwriter participating in the offering of Underwritten Securities, as follows: (a) If the Company does not elect to rely on Rule 434 under the 1933 Act Regulations, immediately following the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement setting forth the principal amount of Underwritten Securities covered thereby and their terms not otherwise specified in the Prospectus or the Indenture, the names of the Underwriters participating in the offering and the principal amount of Underwritten Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters acting as co-managers in connection with the offering, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, if any, the selling concession and reallowance, if any, any delayed delivery arrangements, and such other information as you and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities; and the Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus (including such Prospectus Supplement) as you shall reasonably request. If the Company elects to rely on Rule 434 under the 1933 Act Regulations, immediately following the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare an abbreviated term sheet that complies with the requirements of Rule 434 under the 1933 Act Regulations and will provide the Underwriters with copies of the form of Rule 434 Prospectus, in such number as you shall reasonably request, and promptly file or transmit for filing with the Commission the form of Prospectus complying with Rule 434(c)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations in accordance with Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. (b) The Company will notify you immediately, and if written notice is requested by you, confirm such notice in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any Prospectus Supplement or other supplement or amendment to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (v) any change in or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any long-term debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review its rating of any long-term debt securities of the Company, and (vi) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; and the Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. 12
(c) At any time when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities, the Company will give you notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, 1934 Act or otherwise (including any revised prospectus which the Company proposes for use by the Underwriters in connection with an offering of Underwritten Securities which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement first becomes effective, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, or any abbreviated term sheet prepared in reliance on Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations), and will furnish you with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed or used a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form to which you or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object. (d) The Company will deliver to each Underwriter as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) as such Underwriter reasonably requests. (e) The Company will furnish to each Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the 1934 Act Regulations. (f) If at any time when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, then the Company will promptly prepare and, subject to Section 3(c) file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement and Prospectus comply with such requirements. 13
(g) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Underwritten Securities and the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws and real estate syndication laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as you may designate; and in each jurisdiction in which the Underwritten Securities and the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for so long as may be required for the distribution of the Underwritten Securities and the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified. (h) With respect to each sale of Underwritten Securities, the Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement. (i) The Company will use its best efforts to meet the requirements to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code for the taxable year in which sales of the Underwritten Securities are to occur. (j) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15 of the 1934 Act within the time period prescribed by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (k) The Company will not, between the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and the Closing Time with respect to the Underwritten Securities covered thereby, without your prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company with a maturity of more than one year (other than the Underwritten Securities which are to be sold pursuant to such Terms Agreement), or if such Terms Agreement relates to Underwritten Securities that are convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock, any Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any security convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock (except for Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to reservations, agreements, employee benefit plans, dividend reinvestment plans, or employee and director stock option plans), except as may otherwise be provided in the applicable Terms Agreement. (l) If the Underwritten Securities are convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive or other similar rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligation to issue such shares upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities. 14
(m) If the Underwritten Securities are convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Company will use its best efforts to list shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or such other national exchange on which the Company's Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, is then listed. Section 4. Payment of Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, including (i) the printing and filing of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the printing and filing of this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Underwritten Securities to the Underwriters, (iv) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants, of the Trustee and its counsel and of any applicable calculation agent or exchange rate agent, (v) the qualification of the Underwritten Securities and the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, under securities laws and real estate syndication laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(g), including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of the Blue Sky Survey, (vi) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, and of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, including each abbreviated term sheet delivered by the Company pursuant to Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, (vii) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Indenture, (viii) any fees charged by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for the rating of the Underwritten Securities, (ix) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to the listing of the Underwritten Securities and the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten securities, if applicable, on any national securities exchange, (x) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (xi) the cost of providing any CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Underwritten Securities or the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, and (xii) the fees and expenses of any depositary in connection with the Underwritten Securities. If the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated by you in accordance with the provisions of Section 5, or Section 9(b)(i), the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters named in such Terms Agreement for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters. Section 5. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in any certificate pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of all of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: 15
(a) At Closing Time, (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission, (ii) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any long-term debt securities of the Company as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement shall not have been lowered or withdrawn since such date nor shall any such rating organization have publicly announced that it has any long-term debt securities of the Company under surveillance or review, and (iii) there shall not have come to your attention any facts that would cause you to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to purchasers of the Underwritten Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at such time, not misleading. (b) At Closing Time, you shall have received: (1) The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Latham & Watkins, counsel for the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect that: (i) If applicable, the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the Prospectus under "Capitalization" (except for subsequent issuances, if any, pursuant to reservations, agreements, employee benefit plans, dividend reinvestment plans or employee and director stock option plans referred to in the Prospectus); and the outstanding capital stock of the Company has been duly authorized, is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is not subject to preemptive or other similar rights arising by operation of law or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, otherwise. (ii) When executed, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and against payment of the consideration therefor specified in the applicable Terms Agreement or the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, the Underwritten Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms; and a registered holder of the Underwritten Securities is a beneficiary under the Indenture. (iii) The shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities, if applicable, have been duly and validly authorized and reserved for issuance upon such conversion by all necessary corporate action and such shares, when issued upon such conversion, will be duly and validly issued and will be fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of such shares upon such conversion will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights arising by operation of law or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge and information, otherwise.

(v) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.

(xi) The Company is not required to be registered under the 1940 Act. 17
(xii) Commencing with the Company's taxable year beginning January 1, 1992, the Company has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a "real estate investment trust," and its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code, provided that such counsel's opinion as to this matter shall be conditioned upon certain representations as to factual matters made by the Company to such counsel as described therein. (xiii) The statements set forth (a) in the Prospectus under the caption "Material Federal Income Tax Considerations to Us of Our REIT Election" and (b) in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Material Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of the statutes or regulations referred to therein, are accurate summaries in all material respects.

Section 6. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows: (1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission, or alleged omission therefrom, of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission referred to in subsection (1) above, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (3) against any and all expense whatsoever (including, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by you), as incurred, which was reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above; 24
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or made in reliance upon the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; provided, further, that with respect to any preliminary prospectus, such indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter) if the person asserting any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses purchased the Underwritten Securities which are the subject thereof from such Underwriter and if such person was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated therein by reference) at or prior to confirmation of the sale of such Underwritten Securities to such person in any case where such sending or giving is required by the 1933 Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and the Prospectus was delivered to such Underwriter a reasonable amount of time prior to the date of delivery of such confirmation. (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 25
Section 7. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the offering of the Underwritten Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the Underwriters in respect of such offering, as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the applicable Prospectus Supplement in respect of such offering bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities purchased by it pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses. The Underwriters' obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Section 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, or investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities. 26
Section 9. Termination of Agreement. (a) This Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Company or by you upon the giving of 30 days' written notice of such termination to the other party hereto. (b) You may also terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the applicable Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, the effect of which is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (iii) trading in any of the securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or the Nasdaq National Market or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by Federal, New York or Maryland authorities, or (iv) there has occurred a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services, or (v) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any long-term debt securities of the Company as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement shall have been lowered or withdrawn since such date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has any long-term debt securities of the Company under surveillance or review. (c) In the event of any such termination, (x) the covenants set forth in Section 3 with respect to any offering of Underwritten Securities shall remain in effect so long as any Underwriter owns any such Underwritten Securities purchased from the Company pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and (y) the covenant set forth in Section 3(h) hereof, the provisions of Section 4 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 8 and 13 hereof shall remain in effect Section 10. Default by one or More of the Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the applicable Closing Time to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then you shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, you shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: 27
(a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters named in such Terms Agreement shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default under this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
