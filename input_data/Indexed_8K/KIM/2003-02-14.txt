During the quarter, Kimco increased the occupancy of its parent shopping center portfolio to 87.8 percent from 86.0 percent at September 30, 2002 and from a low of 85.3 percent at June 30, 2002. The increase in occupancy was the result of new leasing, property acquisitions and property sales. For the quarter, Kimco signed 118 new leases totaling 1.4 million square feet bringing the full year total leases signed in the parent portfolio to 380 or 3.9 million square feet. Average base rent on these new leases is approximately $7.18 per square foot.
In addition to the leases signed during the year in the Company's parent portfolio, 59 leases were signed totaling 461,000 square feet in the Kimco Income REIT (KIR) and 184 leases totaling 1.5 million square feet in the Company's merchant building business, Kimco Developers, Inc. (KDI). For the Company's entire property portfolio, which is comprised of interests in approximately 90 million square feet, the Company signed 623 new leases totaling 5.9 million square feet. Kimco continues to have success leasing and disposing of vacancies that resulted from the Kmart bankruptcy. During the fourth quarter, the Company executed eight leases and sold seven former Kmart sites. During the year, the Company made significant progress repositioning 29 of the 31 leases rejected by Kmart. As previously announced, management does not anticipate the recent store closing announcement by Kmart will have a material impact on the Company's expected 2003 operating results.
