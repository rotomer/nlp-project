Exhibit 99.1 Kimco Realty Reports First Quarter 2003 Operating Results NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 28, 2003-- Net Income Per Share Increases 18.9 Percent to $0.63; FFO Per Share Increases 4.0 Percent to $0.78 Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today announced that net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 rose 16.5 percent to $71.0 million from $60.9 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per share basis, net income rose 18.9 percent to $0.63 per common share from $0.53 per common share a year earlier. First quarter funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted measure of REIT performance, rose 5.0 percent to $82.9 million from $78.9 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per common share basis, first quarter FFO increased 4.0 percent to $0.78 from $0.75 a year ago. FFO excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties and gains on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.3 million, or $0.03 per share and $6.3 million, or $0.06 per share, respectively. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO is included in this release. Revenues from rental property increased 10.7 percent to $124.1 million from $112.1 million, a year ago. During the quarter, Kimco increased the occupancy of its parent shopping center portfolio to 89.1 percent from 87.8 percent at December 31, 2002 and from a low of 85.3 percent at June 30, 2002. The increase in occupancy was the result of new leasing and property sales. For the quarter, Kimco signed 97 new leases in the parent portfolio totaling 893,000 square feet. Average base rent on these new leases is approximately $7.49 per square foot. Effective May 2003, seven locations Kimco leased to Kmart Corporation in its operating portfolios will be rejected as part of Kmart's plan of reorganization. Kimco is in advanced discussions to lease or dispose of each of these sites. The impact of these lease rejections is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial results and had previously been factored in the Company's earnings guidance. Occupancy in the Company's operating joint ventures with institutional investors remained strong during the quarter. Occupancy in the Kimco Income REIT (KIR), which consists of 70 shopping centers totaling 14.6 million square feet, was 98.6 percent. The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio (KROP), which consists of 17 shopping centers totaling 2.2 million square feet, also maintained a high level of occupancy at 95.1 percent. During the quarter, retailers' appetite for new store locations remained strong. Across Kimco's portfolios, including Kimco Developers Inc. (KDI), the Company signed 170 new leases totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet at an average base rent of $9.41 per square foot. Investment Activity ------------------- During the quarter, Kimco acquired interests in 10 shopping center properties and three single tenant sites totaling 2.1 million square feet of gross leasable area for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $246.1 million. These properties were acquired for the Company's portfolios as follows: -- Kimco's parent portfolio acquired interests in six shopping centers, for a total cost of $102.5 million, including one shopping center in Canada in its joint venture with RioCan REIT. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, the Company acquired interests in three shopping centers for approximately $102.8 million. -- KIR acquired interests in two shopping centers for an aggregate cost of $103.5 million. In addition to closing on the previously announced acquisition of Parkway Supercenter in Seattle, Washington, KIR acquired the Shoppes at Soncy in Amarillo, Texas. Shoppes at Soncy is a 143,000 square foot shopping center anchored by Ross Stores, Bed, Bath & Beyond and Joann Fabrics. -- The KROP joint venture acquired two shopping centers during the quarter. West Ashley Shoppes, a 137,000 square foot shopping center in Charleston, South Carolina, was acquired for $9.2 million. Market Square at Montrose, a 506,000 Home Depot anchored shopping center, was acquired for $30.9 million. This shopping center is located in Montrose, Ohio. In addition to the shopping centers acquired, Kimco provided $13.1 million of preferred equity capital to owners of seven properties. Kimco's Preferred Equity Program provides equity capital to real estate owners and developers for expansions, redevelopment and development. Kimco's merchant building business, KDI, completed sales of eight out-parcels in its portfolio and recorded gains on sales of approximately $1.2 million. In addition, during 2003 KDI has acquired interests in three new development projects totaling $8.1 million and invested approximately $34.0 million in its pipeline of 19 existing shopping center developments. During the quarter, Kimco sold two shopping centers from its Kimsouth portfolio for proceeds of approximately $11.0 million. The Company's investment strategy for this portfolio, which originally consisted of 37 shopping centers, includes re-tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. In total, the Company has disposed of four properties for proceeds of $31.4 million since the acquisition of Kimsouth during the fourth quarter of 2002. Earnings Guidance ----------------- Kimco's management updated its earnings guidance for the year, providing a range for FFO per share of $3.16 - $3.21 for the year ending December 31, 2003, which is within its previously issued range of guidance. Management also projected the following range of estimates of FFO for remaining three quarters of the year: Quarter Ending FFO Range June 30, 2003 $0.79 - $0.80 September 30, 2003 $0.79 - $0.81 December 31, 2003 $0.80 - $0.82 Corporate Governance -------------------- Kimco's Board of Directors unanimously agreed to amend the Company's 1998 Equity Participation Plan to generally prohibit the re-pricing of stock options. More specifically, after any stock options are granted, the exercise price of the stock option may not be reduced by the Board without shareholder approval. In addition, the Board established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to oversee all corporate governance matters. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 35 years. Kimco owns and operates the nation's largest portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers with interests in 630 properties comprising approximately 91.7 million square feet of leasable space located throughout 41 states, Canada and Mexico.
