Exhibit 99.1 Kimco Updates Financial Results Reflecting FASB's Subsequent Deferral of Certain Provisions of SFAS No. 150 NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 10, 2003--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM), the nation's largest owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers, today announced that it has updated its net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, previously reported on October 23, 2003. The Company's previously released operating results reflected a reduction of approximately $2.0 million for the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This release updates those operating results to reflect the November 7, 2003 release of FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 150-3 that defers certain provisions of SFAS No. 150 as they apply to mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests. Reflecting the revised accounting treatment, third quarter net income per diluted common share increased 50.9 percent to $0.80 from $0.53 for the comparable period in 2002. For the nine months, net income per diluted common share increased 18.8 percent to $1.90 from $1.60 a year earlier. Kimco's previously announced funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted measure of REIT performance, is not affected by this update. In addition, management has provided a reconciliation from net income of its previously issued guidance for FFO per share in the fourth quarter of 2003 of $0.84 and for FFO per share in 2004 of between $3.39 and $3.45 per share. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 35 years. Kimco owns and operates the nation's largest portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers with interests in 698 properties comprising approximately 100 million square feet of leasable space located throughout 40 states, Canada and Mexico.

Safe Harbor Statement: The statements in this release, including but not limited to the earning guidance provided, state the Company's and management's hopes, intentions, beliefs, expectations or projections of the future and are forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, increases in interest rates, increases in operating costs and real estate taxes. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, including but not limited to the Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the Company or the SEC.

FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains or losses on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Net income would be increased by $1,423 and $4,269 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.
