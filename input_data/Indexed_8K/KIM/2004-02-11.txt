Exhibit 99.1 Kimco Realty Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Operating Results for 2003 NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 11, 2004-- Achieves Record Full Year FFO Per Diluted Common Share of $3.23; Fourth Quarter FFO Per Diluted Common Share Increases to $0.85 Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM), the nation's largest owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers, today announced that fourth quarter net income for the period ended December 31, 2003, increased 33.5 percent to $84.1 million from $63.0 million for the same period last year. Fourth quarter net income per diluted common share was $0.72, an increase of 28.6 percent from $0.56 a year ago. Funds from operations (FFO) rose 33.9 percent to $96.3 million, from $71.9 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per common share basis, FFO increased 25.0 percent to $0.85 from $0.68 for the same period last year. Previously reported FFO for the fourth quarter and year ended 2002 has been reduced by approximately $10.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share to reflect clarifications with The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' (NAREIT) definition of FFO. The prior year adjustments are attributable to the inclusion in FFO of gains from the early extinguishment of debt and non-cash adjustments to asset carrying values. The Company's growth in FFO per share on the previously reported fourth quarter 2002 per share amount of $0.78 would have been 10.3 percent on a comparable basis. Funds from operations continues to exclude gains and losses from sales of operating properties. For the fourth quarter 2003, FFO excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties of approximately $20.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share. FFO for the fourth quarter 2002 excludes gains on dispositions of approximately $11.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measurement used as a standard in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO is included in this release. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net income increased 25.3 percent to $307.9 million from $245.7 million for the same period last year. Net income per diluted common share increased to $2.62 from $2.16 for the same period in the previous year. Funds from operations rose 14.3 percent to $353.1 million for the year ended 2003 from $308.9 million in the year earlier period. On a diluted per common share basis, FFO increased 10.2 percent to $3.23 from $2.93 a year ago. Full year 2002 FFO has also been adjusted for NAREIT's definition as noted above. Prior to taking into account the adjustments, Kimco's FFO per share growth would have been 5.0 percent on a comparable basis. Funds from operations for the full year 2003 excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties of approximately $50.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share. For the full year 2002, FFO excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties of $12.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share. During the quarter, Kimco increased the occupancy of its parent shopping center portfolio to 90.7 percent from 89.5 percent at September 30, 2003 and 87.8 percent a year ago.

(3) 2002 FFO was reduced from $3.03 to $2.93 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and from $0.78 to $0.68 for the three months ended December 31, 2002 to include gains on early extinguishment of debt of $22,255 and adjustments to property carrying values of ($33,030). NOTE: Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains or losses on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items.
