Exhibit 99.1 Kimco Realty Reports Record Funds from Operations NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2004--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) Highlights: -- Record FFO of $0.89 Per Share, $0.04 Above the Thomson First Call Mean Estimate -- Company Increasing 2004 FFO Guidance -- Portfolio Occupancy Improves to 91.9 percent, 120 Basis Point Increase for the Quarter, 280 Basis Point Increase for the Year Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today announced income from continuing operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004 of $70.9 million compared to $61.4 million a year earlier, an increase of 15.5 percent. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations increased 18.5 percent to $0.64 from $0.54 reported in the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the first quarter was $71.4 million compared to $71.0 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per share basis, net income was $0.61 compared to $0.63 a year earlier. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 include gains and losses from sales of operating properties and the early extinguishment of debt. Included in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 are charges to adjust properties carrying values to net realizable value of $4.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, and gains on dispositions of operating properties of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 are gains on early extinguishment of debt of $6.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, and gains on sales of operating properties of $3.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share. Kimco's first quarter funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted measure of REIT performance, rose 13.6 percent to $101.3 million from $89.2 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per common share basis, first quarter FFO increased 6.0 percent to $0.89 from $0.84 a year ago and was $0.04 above the Thomson First Call mean estimate. FFO on a per share basis and on an absolute basis were the highest reported for any quarter in the Company's history. Previously reported FFO for first quarter 2003 was increased $6.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share to include gains on the early extinguishment of debt. The Company's growth in FFO per share on the previously reported first quarter 2003 per share amount of $0.78 would have been 14.1 percent, on a comparable basis. Funds from operations excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties and joint venture operating properties of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.02 per share and $3.3 million, or $0.03 per share, for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Losses on properties held for sale or sold in the amount of $4.2 million, or $0.04 per share during the first quarter have not been added back to net income to determine FFO based on the Company's interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission comments requiring asset impairments be included in FFO. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO is included in this release. Kimco's consolidated property portfolio performance continued to improve during the quarter. Revenues from rental property increased 17.1 percent to $139.9 million from $119.5 million and net operating income increased 19.2 percent to $103.4 million from $86.7 million a year earlier. Acquisition activities during 2003 and first quarter 2004 and occupancy increases in the portfolio were the primary drivers of these increased operating results. During the quarter, Kimco's parent portfolio occupancy increased to 91.9 percent from 90.7 percent at December 31, 2003 and 89.1 percent a year earlier. The increase in occupancy was the result of new leasing, acquisition activity and property sales. For the quarter, Kimco signed 148 new leases in this portfolio totaling 1.2 million square feet, an increase of 51 leases and approximately 300,000 square feet over leasing activity in the first quarter of 2003. Occupancy in the Company's operating joint ventures with institutional investors remained strong during the quarter. Occupancy in the Kimco Income REIT (KIR), which consists of 70 shopping centers totaling 14.6 million square feet, was 97.3 percent. The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio (KROP), a joint venture with GE Real Estate that consisted of 22 shopping centers totaling 3.4 million square feet at quarter end, also maintained a high level of occupancy at 98.0 percent. Investment Activity During the quarter, Kimco acquired interests in six shopping center properties and a parcel of land for development. The properties, which total 1.7 million square feet of gross leasable area, were acquired in separate transactions for an aggregate amount of $256.6 million. Four of these acquisitions are designated for Kimco's co-investment programs, further bolstering the Company's management business. In addition, Kimco continued to expand its preferred equity program investing $18.4 million in four properties. Kimco's preferred equity portfolio has grown to include 28 properties with an aggregate commitment of approximately $89 million. Kimco anticipates closing on approximately seven more preferred equity transactions aggregating approximately $13.0 million of new investment during the second quarter. The pending commitments include the Company's first transaction in Mexico for this business. Kimco recently transferred five properties to KROP from the portfolio it acquired from Mid Atlantic Realty Trust (MART). KROP will be acquiring 13 additional former MART properties during the coming months. Kimco's merchant building business, Kimco Developers Inc. (KDI), completed sales of one shopping center and portions of four additional projects generating proceeds of $49.3 million. These property sales resulted in gains on sales of approximately $3.9 million, net of tax. In addition, KDI invested approximately $30.9 million in its pipeline of 28 existing shopping center developments. Kimco and The Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund Series recently entered into a credit support agreement with Sterling Centrecorp Inc. (TSX: SCF), a leading owner and manager of retail properties in Canada. The agreement provides that Kimco and Third Avenue will provide up to a maximum of Cdn$20.0 million and a minimum of Cdn$5.0 million of capital to assist Sterling in re-capitalizing their balance sheet. In exchange for agreeing to provide the funding commitment, Kimco and Third Avenue have been issued common shares and warrants in Sterling. During the quarter, Kimco sold four shopping center properties from the parent portfolio generating proceeds of $11.4 million, KROP sold two properties for proceeds of $20.1 million and the Company terminated, or did not renew, four retail store leasehold positions. In addition, Kimco sold three shopping centers from its Kimsouth portfolio for proceeds of approximately $31.9 million. This portfolio, which was acquired in November 2002, originally consisted of 37 shopping centers and currently has 19 properties remaining. Earnings Guidance As a result of the Company's strong operating performance and improved outlook for 2004, Kimco's management increased its range of guidance for FFO. Management now anticipates a range for FFO per share of $3.47 - $3.52, increased from the previously provided range of $3.41 - $3.46 for the year ending December 31, 2004. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 45 years. Kimco owns and operates the nation's largest portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers with interests in 695 properties comprising approximately 102.0 million square feet of leasable space located throughout 41 states, Canada and Mexico.

For the period ended March 31, 2003, the impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore has not been included. Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation.

Funds from operations would be increased by $1,502 and $1,423 for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (4) 2003 FFO was increased from $82,904 to $89,166 for the three months ended March 31, 2003 to include gains on early extinguishment of debt of $6,262 in accordance with NAREIT guidance. NOTE: Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains or losses on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items.
