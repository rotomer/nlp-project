SECTION 1.3 Accounting Terms; GAAP Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that, if Kimco notifies the Administrative Agent that Kimco requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies Kimco that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith. ARTICLE II THE LOANS SECTION 2.1 Several Borrowers and Loans. In accordance with and subject to the remaining terms of this Article II, each Borrower shall have the right, from time to time and at any time to request one or more Revolving Credit Loans (as defined below), which Loan(s) shall be (i) advanced by the Lenders for the account of the applicable Borrower and (ii) the several obligation of such Borrower and not the joint and several obligations of the other Borrowers. SECTION 2.2 Loans; Etc. (a) Commitments. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans ("Revolving Credit Loans") to the Borrowers from time to time during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the then outstanding L/C Obligations, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment. During the Commitment Period the Borrowers may use the Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall, at the time of the making of any extension of credit hereunder, the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit of all of the Lenders exceed the aggregate Commitments then in effect. (ii) Each Revolving Credit Loan shall be made to the applicable Borrower as part of a borrowing consisting of Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required. 24
(iii) Subject to Section 2.8 and Section 2.10, the Revolving Credit Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans, Cdn Prime Loans, CDOR Loans or Money Market Loans or a combination thereof, as determined by the applicable Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.2(d) and 2.4, provided that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be made as a Eurodollar Loan or CDOR Loan after the day that is one (1) month prior to the Termination Date. Cdn Prime Loans and CDOR Loans shall be made in Cdn Dollars. All other Loans shall be made in Dollars. (b) Notes. The Revolving Credit Loans made by a Lender to a Borrower shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed and delivered by such Borrower at the request of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1, with appropriate insertions as to the applicable Borrower, payee and date (a "Revolving Credit Note"), payable to the order of such Lender and in a principal amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Lender. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record, as applicable, the name of the relevant Borrower, the date, Type, currency and amount of each Revolving Credit Loan made by such Lender, each continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a portion thereof to another Type, the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereof and, in the case of CDOR Loans and Eurodollar Loans, the length of each Interest Period with respect thereto and, in the case of Money Market Loans, the Money Market Loan Maturity Date with respect thereto, on the schedule annexed to and constituting a part of its Revolving Credit Note or in the accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the ordinary course of its business, and any such recordation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded; provided that the failure by any Lender to make any such recordation or any error in such recordation shall not affect the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement or the Notes. (c) Repayment of Loans. Each Borrower shall repay (in the relevant currency) all of its then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans on the Termination Date (or, if earlier, the applicable Money Market Loan Maturity Date in respect of a Money Market Loan) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender. (d) Procedure for Borrowing Revolving Credit Loans. The Borrowers may borrow Revolving Credit Loans during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., Toronto time, (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of the requested Revolving Credit Loans are to be initially Eurodollar Loans, (ii) two (2) Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of the requested Revolving Credit Loans are to be initially Money Market Loans or CDOR Loans, or (iii) one (1) Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, otherwise), specifying (w) the name of the relevant Borrower (if such notice is given by Kimco on behalf of a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16) and the amount to be borrowed, (x) the requested Borrowing Date and, in the case of each Money Market Loan, the requested Money Market Loan Maturity Date, (y) whether the borrowing is to be of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans, Cdn Prime Loans, CDOR Loans, Money Market Loans or a combination thereof and (z) if the borrowing is to be entirely or partly of Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans the respective amounts of each such Type of Revolving Credit Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Periods therefor. Each borrowing under the Commitments shall be in a principal amount equal to (i) in the case of ABR Loans or Cdn Prime Loans, $500,000 or C$500,000 (as the case may be) or a whole multiple of $100,000 or C$100,000 (as the case may be) in excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Commitments are less than C$500,000, such lesser Cdn Dollar Amount) and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, CDOR Loans or Money Market Loans, $2,000,000 or C$2,000,000 (as the case may be) or a whole multiple of $100,000 or C$100,000 (as the case may be) in excess thereof, in each case subject to Section 2.2(e). Upon receipt of any such notice from a Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof and of the proposed Money Market Rate (if applicable). Each Lender will notify the Administrative Agent within one (1) Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date for any Money Market Loan as to whether or not such Lender is willing to accept the proposed Money Market Rate. If any Lender does not accept such proposed Money Market Rate, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower, and that portion of the requested borrowing that was to constitute Money Market Loans will be deemed to be cancelled in its entirety with respect to all Lenders (and not merely with respect to any such non-accepting Lender). Each Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available (if such Lender is a Canadian Institution, from its U.S. Office, and if such Lender is a U.S. Institution, from its Canadian Office) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent as specified to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent and prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time (or in the case of Money Market Loans having a Money Market Loan Maturity Date of six (6) days or less from the relevant Borrowing Date, 3:00 P.M., New York City time), on the Borrowing Date requested by the applicable Borrower in funds in the applicable currency and immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the applicable account of the applicable Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. In no event may the number of Money Market Loans requested in any calendar month exceed four (4). In no event may the number of Money Market Loans requested in any calendar year exceed twelve (12). 25
(e) Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, prepayments, conversions and continuations of Revolving Credit Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Eurodollar Tranche and Money Market Tranche shall be equal to $2,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each CDOR Tranche shall be equal to C$2,000,000 or a whole multiple of C$100,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) there shall be no more than seven (7) Eurodollar Tranches or CDOR Tranches outstanding at any one time. (f) Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrowers shall have the right, upon not less than three (3) Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each Lender thereof), to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments; provided that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any payments of the Revolving Credit Loans made on the effective date thereof, (i) the aggregate Cdn Dollar Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding, plus the aggregate Cdn Dollar Amount of the L/C Obligations then outstanding, would exceed the total Commitments then in effect or (ii) the Available Commitment of any Lender would be less than zero. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to C$10,000,000 or a whole multiple of C$1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then in effect. No such reductions may occur in excess of one (1) per calendar month. 26
SECTION 2.3 Optional and Mandatory Prepayments. (a) Each Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay (in the relevant currency) its Revolving Credit Loans (subject, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, CDOR Loans and Money Market Loans to compliance with the terms of Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.13), in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable notice from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans, Cdn Prime Loans, CDOR Loans, Money Market Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any notice of prepayment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13. Subject to Section 2.2(e), partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 (if prepaying Dollar-Denominated Loans) or C$500,000 (if prepaying Cdn Dollar-Denominated Loans) or a whole multiple of $100,000 or C$100,000 (as the case may be) in excess thereof (or, if less, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans). (b) If, as of 10:00 A.M. Toronto time on the last Business Day of any calendar month, the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit of all of the Lenders exceeds the aggregate Commitments then in effect, then the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans (to be applied to such Loans and in any order designated by the Borrowers, or if not so designated, first to the Dollar-Denominated Loans and then, if necessary, to the Cdn Dollar-Denominated Loans) or terminate or replace Letters of Credit by not later than 12:00 Noon, Toronto time, on such day, to the extent required so that, after giving effect to such prepayments, terminations or replacements, the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit of all the Lenders does not exceed the aggregate Commitment then in effect. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(a) relating to optional prepayments (other than the giving of notices thereunder). The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 10:00 A.M. Toronto time on the last day of any calendar month, give to the Borrowers and the Lenders notice of the amount of any prepayment required to be made pursuant to this paragraph. The determination by the Administrative Agent of any such amount in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. However, the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide any such notice shall not relieve any Borrower from its obligation to make any prepayment otherwise required pursuant to this paragraph. SECTION 2.4 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) Each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert its Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans to ABR Loans or Cdn Prime Loans, by such Borrower giving the Administrative Agent at least two (2) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert its ABR Loans or Cdn Prime Loans to Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans by such Borrower giving the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert its ABR Loans to Cdn Prime Loans (or vice-versa), by such Borrower giving the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans, Cdn Prime Loans, CDOR Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a CDOR Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion that such a conversion is not appropriate, (ii) any such conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.2(e) would not be contravened, and (iii) no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a CDOR Loan after the date that is one (1) month prior to the Termination Date. 27
(b) Any Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the applicable Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan or CDOR Loan may be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion that such a continuation is not appropriate, (ii) if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.2(e) would be contravened, or (iii) after the date that is one (1) month prior to the Termination Date, and provided, further, that if the applicable Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.4(b), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. SECTION 2.5 Fees. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee at a per annum rate for the period from and including the first day of the Commitment Period to but excluding the Termination Date, computed at the Facility Fee Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender, whether used or unused; provided that if such Lender continues to have any Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue at the Facility Fee Rate on the average daily amount of such Lender's Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in Cdn Dollars in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. 28
(b) The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by Kimco pursuant to the Fee Letter; provided that no such fee shall be due or payable after the date on which the Commitments have been terminated and no Loan, Letter of Credit, Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document remains outstanding. (c) The Borrowers shall pay in Cdn Dollars on the Effective Date to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, the Participation Fee set forth in Schedule "A" to the Summary of Terms and Conditions referred to in the Arrangement & Commitment Letter dated June 16, 2004 between Kimco and the Administrative Agent. SECTION 2.6 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. (c) Each Money Market Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Rate applicable thereto plus the Applicable Margin. (d) Each CDOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the CDOR Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (e) Each Cdn Prime Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Cdn Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin. (f) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan, (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal (except as otherwise specified in clause (y) below), the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6 plus 3% or (y) in the case of any overdue principal with respect to Money Market Loans or any overdue interest, fee or other amount, the rate described in Section 2.6(b) plus 3%, in each case from the date of such non-payment to the date on which such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (g) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to Section 2.6(f) shall be payable from time to time on demand. 29
SECTION 2.7 Computation of Interest and Fees (a) Facility fees and interest (other than interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate or the Cdn Prime Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate or the Cdn Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate, CDOR Rate or Money Market Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Revolving Credit Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Cdn Prime Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrowers, deliver to the Borrowers a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate with respect to any Eurodollar Loan or CDOR Loan. (c) For the purpose of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure thereunder, whenever interest to be paid under this Agreement is to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days or any other period of time that is less than a calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate determined pursuant to such calculation is equivalent is the rate so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by either 360 or such other period of time, as the case may be. SECTION 2.8 Inability to Determine Interest Rate If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Credit Loans during such Interest Period; the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Revolving Credit Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans, and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrowers have the right to convert any other Revolving Credit Loans to Eurodollar Loans. 30
SECTION 2.9 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments (a) Each borrowing by a Borrower of Revolving Credit Loans from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by a Borrower on account of any fees hereunder (except for those set forth in the Fee Letter or as otherwise expressly set forth herein) and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on its Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Lenders. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings then due to such parties. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, Toronto time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 10.2, in Dollars or Cdn Dollars, as the case may be, and in immediately available funds. It is understood that, if any payment of principal is made on any day in accordance with the preceding sentence, no interest shall accrue on such day in respect of such principal. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds and currency as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan or a CDOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to any such payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.9(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrowers. 31
SECTION 2.10 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, to continue Eurodollar Loans as such, or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.13. SECTION 2.11 Requirements of Law (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date: (i) shall subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note, any Letter of Credit (or any participation therein) or any Application or any Eurodollar Loan, Money Market Loan or CDOR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Lender in respect thereof (except in each case for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.12 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or the Issuing Lender); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except to the extent that such reserve is specifically subject to Section 2.11(c)), special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any relevant office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate, the Money Market Rate or the CDOR Rate; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; 32
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, by an amount which such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, Money Market Loans or CDOR Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the relevant Borrowers shall promptly pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or the Issuing Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11(a), it shall promptly notify the Borrowers, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, provided that such amounts shall be no greater than amounts that such Lender or the Issuing Lender is generally charging other borrowers or account parties on loans or letters of credit (as the case may be) similarly situated to the relevant Borrower. (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Lender shall have determined that the application of any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or compliance by such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender or the Issuing Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's treatment of its Commitments and Letters of Credit for internal purposes as of the date on which it became a party hereto) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or the Issuing Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such request), the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, for such reduction. (c) The Borrowers agree to pay to each Lender which requests compensation under this Section 2.11(c) (by notice to the Borrowers), on the last day of each Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Lender may be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes any Eurodollar Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrowers) representing such Lender's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation as such Lender shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Lender during such Interest Period, as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such Eurodollar Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period: 33
(i) the principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender to which such Interest Period relates and outstanding on such day; and (ii) the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, and the denominator of which is one (1) minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date minus (y) such numerator; and (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is 360. Any Lender which gives notice under this Section 2.11(c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers) in the event such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease to exist. (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.11 submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrowers shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section 2.11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (the date on which all of the foregoing shall have occurred, the "Final Date"), until the first anniversary of the Final Date. SECTION 2.12 Taxes. (a) All payments made by any Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and after taking into account any credit, deduction, or other tax benefit resulting from such Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Notes, provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Non-U.S. Lender if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of Section 2.12(b). Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by a Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the applicable Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the applicable Borrower showing payment thereof. If any Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 2.12(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 34
(b) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a citizen or resident of the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, or any estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver (on or prior to the Effective Date in the case of any such Person that is a Lender as of the Effective Date) to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S. Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN for portfolio interest, an annual certificate representing under penalty of perjury that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of any Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by any Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, (i) each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender and (ii) each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver any and all other documentation reasonably requested by Borrower from time to time so as to provide a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and Canadian withholding tax on any and all payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrowers (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.12(b), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form or other documentation pursuant to this Section 2.12(b) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. 35
(c) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a Non-U.S. Lender (a "U.S. Lender") shall deliver (on or prior to the Effective Date in the case of any such Person that is a Lender as of the Effective Date) to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such U.S. Lender. Such form shall be delivered by each U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each U.S. Lender shall deliver such form promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such U.S. Lender. SECTION 2.13 Indemnity. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense (including post-judgment expenses) which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, Money Market Loans or CDOR Loans or in the conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans or CDOR Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting or accepting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or (c) the making of a prepayment or conversion of Eurodollar Loans, Money Market Loans or CDOR Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period or the Money Market Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be, with respect thereto. Such indemnification may, at the option of any Lender, include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid or converted, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the relevant Interest Period or the relevant Money Market Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be (or proposed Interest Period or proposed Money Market Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be), in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin or Margin) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market or other relevant market. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder, until the first anniversary of the Final Date. SECTION 2.14 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender and each Transferee agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10, 2.11 or 2.12 with respect to such Lender or Transferee, it will, if requested by the Borrowers, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender or Transferee) to designate another lending office for any Revolving Credit Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender or Transferee, cause such Lender or Transferee and its lending office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 2.14 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of any Lender or Transferee pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. 36
SECTION 2.15 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. The Borrowers shall be permitted to replace any Lender which (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.12, (b) is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10 and as a result thereof any of the actions described in Section 2.10 is required to be taken or (c) defaults in its obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder, with a replacement bank or other financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) the applicable Borrowers shall repay (or the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Revolving Credit Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (iv) the applicable Borrowers shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.13 if any Eurodollar Loan, Money Market Loan or CDOR Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be prepaid (or purchased) other than on the last day of the Interest Period or the Money Market Loan Maturity Date, as the case may be, relating thereto, (v) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, (vi) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the applicable Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (vii) the replaced Lender shall (except as provided in the following clause (ix)) be released from its obligations under this Agreement, (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the applicable Borrowers shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.12, as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender if it defaulted in its obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder. SECTION 2.16 Additional Borrowers; Kimco as Authorized Exclusive Agent. (a) After the Effective Date, any Subsidiary shall constitute a Borrower for purposes of this Agreement if: (i) the Borrowers shall have so notified the Administrative Agent and such Subsidiary and Kimco shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Subsidiary Joinder substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a "Subsidiary Joinder"); (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received, with a counterpart for the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, the executed legal opinion of counsel to such Subsidiary, substantially in the form of Exhibit D as it relates to such Subsidiary, dated the date of the Subsidiary Joinder; 37
(iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received from such Subsidiary a signed replacement (or additional, as applicable) Revolving Credit Note for the account of each Lender (it being acknowledged and agreed by Administrative Agent and each Lender that each such Lender shall, in such event, return to any applicable Borrower which is then being released from its obligations as a Borrower hereunder, the original Revolving Credit Note previously executed and delivered by such Borrower to such Lender); (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate from a Responsible Officer, dated the date of the Subsidiary Joinder, certifying as to the names and offices of the Persons authorized to sign the Loan Documents to be delivered pursuant to the terms hereof by such Subsidiary or Kimco, together with the signatures of each such Person and a certificate of another Responsible Officer, certifying as to the name, office, and signature of such first Responsible Officer; (v) the Administrative Agent shall have received such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably and customarily request relating to the organization, existence and, if and to the extent applicable, good standing of such Subsidiary and Kimco, and the authorization of such Subsidiary and Kimco, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Subsidiary Joinder, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, certified to be true, correct and complete by a Responsible Officer as of the effective date of such Subsidiary Joinder; (vi) such Subsidiary is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary; (vii) after giving effect to such Subsidiary Joinder, there shall be no more than fifteen (15) Borrowers hereunder; and (viii) the Administrative Agent shall have received payment of all reasonable third-party out-of-pocket expenses required to be reimbursed or paid by any Borrower hereunder, including the reasonable fees and disbursements invoiced of the Administrative Agent's counsel (which may be in-house counsel if no external counsel is engaged at any Borrower's expense), if any, in connection with any of the above transactions and the related documentation. When any such Subsidiary becomes a Borrower, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof. (b) Each Borrower under this Agreement (including without limitation, each Borrower as of the Effective Date and each Subsidiary that subsequently becomes a Borrower hereunder), hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally designates and authorizes Kimco (and Kimco hereby accepts the same) as its exclusive agent to act on its behalf in connection with the requesting, funding, maintenance, conversion, continuation and repayment of any Loans hereunder, or the issuance, extension, modification or cancellation of any Letter of Credit hereunder, or any other matter relating to such Loans or Letters of Credit or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents generally, including without limitation, the giving and/or receiving of notices and/or consents or other instruction or direction hereunder (all of the foregoing, collectively, a "Kimco Instruction"), (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may rely on any Kimco Instruction with respect to any and all such matters without further inquiry of or confirmation from such Borrower, or any of them, and that any Kimco Instruction shall control over any conflicting or inconsistent instruction from any Borrower and (iii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the addition of any other Borrower after the Effective Date and agrees to be bound hereunder severally, but not jointly and severally, with all other Borrowers hereunder. 38
Section 2.17 Judgment Currency. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder or under any Note in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at its Toronto Office on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss. SECTION 2.18 Identity of Lenders; Funding of Loans. Each Lender represents that it is either a Canadian Institution or a U.S. Institution and, if it is a U.S. Institution, that its Loans are held as part of its Canadian banking business, and each Lender agrees that it will, so long as it is a Lender hereunder, maintain a Canadian Office or U.S. Office, as applicable, through which it will fund the Loans it makes hereunder, unless otherwise consented to by Kimco (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and not to be required if a Designated Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.) ARTICLE III LETTERS OF CREDIT SECTION 3.1 L/C Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit ("Letters of Credit") for the account of any Borrower or (with the consent of the Administrative Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) its designee, on any Business Day during the Commitment Period other than the last ten (10) Business Days thereof in such form as may be acceptable from time to time to the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the Cdn Dollar Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment, (ii) the Available Commitment of any Lender would be less than zero or (iii) the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit of all the Lenders shall exceed the aggregate Commitments. 39
(b) Each Letter of Credit (i) shall be denominated in Cdn Dollars or Dollars, (ii) shall be available by sight payment (rather than by acceptance, by deferred payment or by negotiation), (iii) shall be a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of a Borrower, contingent or otherwise, incurred in the ordinary course of business and (iv) shall expire no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Termination Date. (c) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs or the ISP and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York. (d) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law. SECTION 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. Any Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent at their respective addresses for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by the Issuing Lender and the applicable Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly following the issuance thereof, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof. SECTION 3.3 Fees and Other Charges (a) Each Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants, a letter of credit fee in the relevant currency with respect to each Letter of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower at a per annum rate, for each day during the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the first date thereafter on which such Letter of Credit shall expire or be cancelled or fully drawn, equal to the L/C Fee Rate in effect on such day, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on such day. In addition, such Borrower shall pay, in the relevant currency, to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.10% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each such Letter of Credit. Letter of credit fees and fronting fees pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date to occur while the relevant Letter of Credit is outstanding and shall be nonrefundable. 40
(b) In addition to the foregoing fees, each Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower. (c) The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute to the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants all fees received by the Administrative Agent for their respective accounts pursuant to this Section 3.3. SECTION 3.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Commitment Percentage in the Issuing Lender's obligations and rights in respect of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder and the amount of each draft or other demand for payment paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if the Issuing Lender notifies it that a draft or other demand for payment has been paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay, in the relevant currency, to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft or other demand for payment, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed. (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal funds rate, as quoted by the Issuing Lender, during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not in fact made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, if the relevant Letter of Credit is denominated in Dollars, or Cdn Prime Loans, if the relevant Letter of Credit is denominated in Cdn Dollars. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 41
(c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with this Section 3.4, the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from a Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it. SECTION 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrowers. (a) Each Borrower agrees to reimburse the Issuing Lender, in the relevant currency, on each date on which the Issuing Lender notifies such Borrower of the date and amount of a draft or other demand for payment presented under any Letter of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower and paid by the Issuing Lender for the amount of (i) such draft or other demand so paid (which reimbursement may be effected through the procedure described in Section 3.5(c)) and (ii) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses (including post-judgment taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses) incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein in lawful money of Canada or the United States of America, as the case may be, and in immediately available funds. (b) Interest shall be payable on any and all amounts remaining unpaid by the applicable Borrower under this Article III from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding ABR Loans (with respect to amounts due in Dollars) or Cdn Prime Loans (with respect to amounts due in Cdn Dollars) which were then overdue. (c) Each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a request by the applicable Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of ABR Loans (if the relevant Letter of Credit is denominated in Dollars) or Cdn Prime Loans (if the relevant Letter of Credit is denominated in Cdn Dollars) in the amount of such drawing. The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the date of such drawing. SECTION 3.6 Obligations Absolute (a) The Borrowers' obligations under this Article III shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any L/C Participant or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. 42
(b) Each Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and such Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5(a) shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or (ii) any dispute between or among any Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or (iii) any claims whatsoever of any Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. (c) The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct. (d) The Borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with any applicable standard of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrowers and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to any Borrower. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that (i) with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, (x) assert or waive application of Article 17 and Article 45 of the Uniform Customs, or (y) accept as a draft any written demand or request for payment under a Letter of Credit even if non-negotiable or not in the form of a draft, and (iii) with respect to documents presented which the Issuing Lender determines do not appear on their face to comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, approach the applicable Borrower for a waiver of the discrepancy(ies), but neither requesting such a waiver from such Borrower nor receiving such a waiver from such Borrower shall obligate the Issuing Lender to make payment against such documents. Each Borrower will notify the Issuing Lender in writing of any objection such Borrower may have to the Issuing Lender's issuance or amendment of any Letter of Credit requested by such Borrower, the Issuing Lender's honor or dishonor of any presentation under any such Letter of Credit, or any other action or inaction taken or proposed to be taken by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with this Agreement or any such Letter of Credit. Such Borrower's notice of objection must be delivered to the Issuing Lender within five (5) Business Days after such Borrower receives notice of the action or inaction it objects to. Such Borrower's failure to give such notice of objection within five (5) Business Days after such Borrower's actual receipt of notice of the action or inaction it objects to shall automatically waive such Borrower's objection, authorize or ratify the Issuing Lender's action or inaction, and preclude such Borrower from raising the objection as a defense or claim against the Issuing Lender. 43
SECTION 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments If any draft or other demand for payment shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower that requested such Letter of Credit of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to such Borrower in connection with any draft or other demand for payment presented for payment under any such Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft or other demand for payment) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. SECTION 3.8 Applications. To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply. SECTION 3.9 Replacement of the Issuing Lender The Issuing Lender may be replaced by one of the other Lenders at any time by written agreement among the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Lender.

With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Borrowers shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by and under the exclusive dominion and control of the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants, a security interest in such cash collateral to secure all obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts or other demands for payment drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the applicable Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled thereto. Each Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants, such further documents and instruments as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the creation and perfection of the within security interest in such cash collateral account. Except as expressly provided above in this Article, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived. If an event occurs with respect to a Borrower that would constitute a Default hereunder that is capable of cure by the release of such Person as a Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then such event shall not constitute a Default hereunder (or such Default shall be deemed waived) if, within two (2) Business Days after the Administrative Agent has given notice to Kimco of the occurrence of such event, (a) Kimco has delivered to the Administrative Agent a request for the release of such Borrower and describing the event constituting such Default in such detail as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (b) all Loans made to such Borrower, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall have been repaid in full, (c) any other amount owing to any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent by such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been paid in full, (d) all Letters of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower shall have expired or been terminated, and (e) after giving effect to the release of such Borrower, there shall be at least one (1) Borrower remaining as such hereunder, and provided that (i) there shall be no other Default or Event of Default, before and after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and (ii) Kimco shall be in compliance with all covenants under Section 7.1 after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and would have been in compliance therewith for the most recent Test Period if such release had been given effect (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property) during such Test Period. Upon compliance with all the provisions of the foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall be released from its obligations (and shall no longer be entitled to any benefits) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. 63
If an event occurs with respect to a Guarantor (other than Kimco) that would constitute a Default hereunder that does not result in a Material Adverse Effect and that is capable of cure by the release of such Person as a Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then such event shall not constitute a Default hereunder (or such Default shall be deemed waived) if, within two (2) Business Days after the Administrative Agent has given notice to Kimco of the occurrence of such event, Kimco has delivered to the Administrative Agent a request for the release of such Guarantor and describing the event constituting such Default in such detail as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and, after giving effect to the release of such Guarantor, no more than ten (10) Guarantors shall have been released hereunder, and provided that (a) there shall be no other Default or Event of Default, before and after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and (b) Kimco shall be in compliance with all covenants under Section 7.1 after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and would have been in compliance therewith for the most recent Test Period if such release had been given effect (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property) during such Test Period. Upon compliance with all the provisions of the foregoing sentence, such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations (and shall no longer be entitled to any benefits) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. ARTICLE IX THE AGENTS SECTION 9.1 The Agents. For purposes of this Section 9.1 and Section 10.6, the term "Related Parties" shall mean, with respect to any specified Person, (i) any Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with such specified Person, and (ii) the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors of such specified Person and of any other Person referred to in the preceding clause (i). (a) Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 64
(b) The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and each Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with such bank (an "Administrative Agent Affiliate") may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein), and (iii) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Kimco or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Administrative Agent Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default other than nonpayment of principal or interest unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by Kimco, any Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. (d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Kimco or the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 65
(e) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. (f) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrowers. By the Required Lenders' giving at least thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent may be removed, by action of the Required Lenders (excluding the bank serving as Administrative Agent (the "Agent Bank")), (i) at any time for gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the Required Lenders (excluding for such determination the Agent Bank), or (ii) in the event that the Agent Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, shall have assigned all of its outstanding Commitments, Loans, and its Commitment Percentage of the L/C Obligations to another bank, financial institution or other entity pursuant to Section 10.6, and at the end of such thirty (30) Business Day period the Agent Bank shall be deemed discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Documents, provided, however that it is a condition to the removal of the Administrative Agent under clause (ii) above in the circumstance in which the Agent Bank is the Issuing Lender hereunder, that all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender (including Letters of Credit issued by any Affiliate of the Agent Bank) hereunder shall be returned to the Issuing Lender, that the Issuing Lender shall be reimbursed for all drafts or other demands for payment under the Letters of Credit that have not yet been reimbursed by the applicable Borrower or paid by the L/C Participants (except to the extent of the Commitment Percentage of L/C Obligations assigned by the Agent Bank), that all fees and expenses accrued and payable to the Issuing Lender be paid, and that the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to be replaced under Section 3.9 hereof. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor. In the case of resignation by the Administrative Agent, if no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank organized under the laws of Canada with an office in Toronto, Canada and New York, New York, or a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor to a retired Administrative Agent, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under any other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article, including Section 9.2, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 66
(g) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. SECTION 9.2 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.2 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Revolving Credit Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitment Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and regardless of whether pre-judgment or post-judgment) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting solely from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 10.6 Successors and Assigns For purposes of this Section 10.6 the term "Related Parties" shall have the meaning given thereto in Section 9.1 hereof. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit (an "Issuing Lender Affiliate")), except that (i) neither Kimco nor any Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Kimco or any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Issuing Lender Affiliate), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of: (A) the Borrowers, provided that no consent of any of the Borrowers shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender who is an Eligible Assignee, an Approved Fund (as defined below) who is an Eligible Assignee, or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender with a Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. 71
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender who is an Eligible Assignee or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption (as defined below) with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than C$5,000,000 unless each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no consent of any of the Borrowers shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption substantially in the form of Exhibit A or in any other form approved by the Administrative Agent (an "Assignment and Assumption"), together with a processing and recordation fee of C$4,000 (which, except as provided in Section 2.15, shall not be payable by the Borrowers); and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall (i) deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in the form approved by the Administrative Agent (an "Administrative Questionnaire") and (ii) certify in writing (pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption or otherwise) for the benefit of the Borrowers that it is an Eligible Assignee. For the purposes of this Section 10.06, the term "Approved Fund" has the following meaning: "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is an Eligible Assignee and is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 72
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and payments made by the Issuing Lender pursuant to the Letters of Credit, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in this paragraph (b) and any written consent to such assignment required by this paragraph (b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Lender, sell participations to an Eligible Assignee or, with the consent of the Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and not to be required if a Designated Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) to one or more other banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (C) the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 10.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.11(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 10.11(a) as though it were a Lender. 73
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.11 or 2.12 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.12(a) unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply, and does so comply, with Section 2.12(b) as though it were a Lender. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign, or grant a security interest in, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment or grant of a security interest, nor the exercise of remedies in respect of such security interest, shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 10.7 Disclosure. Subject to Section 10.19, Kimco and each Borrower authorize each Lender to disclose to any Participant or assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning Kimco and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of Kimco or any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of Kimco or any Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of Kimco and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement. SECTION 10.8 [Intentionally Omitted]. SECTION 10.9 Extension of Maturity Date By notice to the Administrative Agent not earlier than twelve (12) months nor later than three (3) months before the Maturity Date specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Maturity Date" (the "Original Maturity Date"), the Borrowers may extend the Maturity Date to the date one year after the Original Maturity Date (the "Extended Maturity Date"); provided that (i) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders on or before on the Original Maturity Date a nonrefundable extension fee in an amount equal to 0.15% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect on the Original Maturity Date, whether used or unused, and (ii) the following conditions shall be satisfied: (a) Each of the representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the as of the Original Maturity Date as if made on and as of such date except for representations and warranties expressly stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date. 74
(b) (i) No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such notice or as of the Original Maturity Date, and (ii) Kimco would be in compliance with each financial covenant set forth in paragraphs (a) through (g) of Section 7.1 if the ratio or amount referred to therein were to be calculated as of the Original Maturity Date (provided that for the purposes of determining such compliance, Gross Asset Value and Value of Unencumbered Properties shall be determined for the most recent Test Period as to which a compliance certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b)). The request for an extension under this Section 10.9 shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrowers as of the date of such request and as of the Original Maturity Date that the conditions contained in this Section 10.9 have been satisfied, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer to such effect. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of any such extension. SECTION 10.10 Release of Guarantors; Release of Borrowers. (a) Upon the request of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, a Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from the Guarantee (i) in order to enter into (x) a bona fide mortgage securing Non-Recourse Indebtedness of an unaffiliated third party or (y) a joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or similar agreement with an unaffiliated third party, in either case containing a Prohibiting Provision (provided that, in any circumstances referred to in this clause (i), after giving effect to the relevant transaction, the execution and delivery of the Guarantee by such Guarantor would have been excused pursuant to the provisions of the definition of the term "Qualified Wholly Owned Subsidiary"), or (ii) upon (x) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Properties owned directly or indirectly by such Guarantor, or (y) the transfer of all the Capital Stock of such Guarantor in a transaction having the practical effect of a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Properties owned directly or indirectly by such Guarantor; provided, however, that, in the case of any such release (under clause (i) or clause (ii)), (A) there is no Default or Event of Default, before and after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and (B) Kimco is in compliance with all covenants under Section 7.1 after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and would have been in compliance therewith for the most recent Test Period if such release had been given effect (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property) during such Test Period. 75
(b) Upon the request of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, a Borrower shall be released from its obligations and no longer be entitled to any benefits hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (i) in order to enter into (x) a bona fide mortgage securing Non-Recourse Indebtedness of an unaffiliated third party or (y) a joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or similar agreement with an unaffiliated third party, in either case containing a Prohibiting Provision (provided that, in any circumstances referred to in this clause (i), after giving effect to the relevant transaction, the execution and delivery of the Guarantee by such Borrower (if such Borrower were a Subsidiary Guarantor) would have been excused pursuant to the provisions of the definition of the term "Qualified Wholly Owned Subsidiary"), or (ii) upon (x) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Properties owned directly or indirectly by such Borrower, or (y) the transfer of all the Capital Stock of such Borrower in a transaction having the practical effect of a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Properties owned directly or indirectly by such Borrower, provided, however, that, in the case of any such release (under clause (i) or clause (ii)), (A) there is no Default or Event of Default, before and after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), (B) Kimco is in compliance with all covenants under Section 7.1 after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property), and would have been in compliance therewith for the most recent Test Period if such release had been given effect (including any changes resulting from recharacterization of Unencumbered Property) during such Test Period, (C) all Loans made to such Borrower, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall have been repaid in full, (D) any other amount owing to any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent by such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been paid in full, (E) all Letters of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower shall have expired or been terminated and (F) after giving effect to such release, there shall be at least one (1) Borrower remaining as such hereunder. SECTION 10.11 Adjustments; Set-off (a) If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Revolving Credit Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Article VIII(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Revolving Credit Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, or interest thereon, such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Revolving Credit Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that (i) if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Credit Loans or participations in respect of Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). 76
(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender and each of its Affiliates shall have the right, without prior notice to any Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by any Borrower hereunder or under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, obligations, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any of its Affiliates or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
