During the quarter, Kimco's parent portfolio occupancy increased to 93.6 percent from 92.9 percent at September 30, 2004 and 90.7 percent a year earlier. The increase in occupancy was the result of new leasing, acquisition activity and property sales. For the quarter, Kimco signed 101 new leases in this portfolio totaling 540,000 square feet. For the full year the Company signed 515 new leases in this portfolio, a 20 percent increase from 2003, totaling approximately 3.2 million square feet of gross leasable area. Fourth Quarter Investment Summary During the fourth quarter, Kimco acquired interests in $1.5 billion of shopping center properties. In the parent portfolio the Company acquired 13 properties totaling 962,000 square feet of gross leasable area aggregating approximately $118.1 million. In the Company's co-investment programs, Kimco acquired interests in 37 shopping centers for approximately $1.3 billion. This total includes the recent acquisition of Price Legacy Corporation in which Kimco has a 15.0 percent interest and manages the portfolio. Kimco also sold six properties for $38.9 million, recognizing net gains on sales of $3.3 million. Kimco continues to identify properties in the portfolio for sale amid strong market demand for shopping center properties. The Company's preferred equity program had a strong fourth quarter for new transactions. Kimco invested $55.7 million in 21 properties during the quarter under this program. Two preferred equity investments were repaid during the quarter generating $10.0 million of proceeds, including a profit participation above the Company's original investment. Retail Property Solutions, the Company's business of providing capital and services to retailers, led an $18.5 million financing package to Tidymans LLC, an independent grocery store operator in the Pacific Northwest.

Kimco Select Investments invested approximately $19.5 million in real estate related securities and $32.0 million in a sale leaseback during the quarter. In addition, the Company exercised 2.5 million warrants to acquire an equal number of RioCan REIT units at a price of CAD$11.02. At the exercise price, RioCan's dividend represents an 11.4 percent yield and the recent closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was CAD$19.13 per unit. The Company also purchased CAD$4.4 million of convertible debentures issued by Sterling Centrecorp as part of a balance sheet recapitalization. This represents Kimco's second convertible debenture transaction with Sterling, raising Kimco's total investment to CAD$8.9 million. Kimco's merchant building business, Kimco Developers Inc. (KDI), completed the sale of two shopping centers and sold portions of eight additional projects generating proceeds of $39.4 million.

Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2004 2003 -------- ------- -------- --------- Funds From Operations(1) Net income $75,807 $84,069 $297,137 $307,879 Gain on disposition of operating properties, net of minority interests (3,325)(20,369) (15,390) (50,834) Gain on disposition of joint venture operating properties (1,186) -- (4,045) -- Depreciation and amortization 25,264 26,575 102,872 89,068 Depreciation and amortization - real estate joint ventures 9,957 8,945 36,400 29,456 Redemption costs -- -- -- (7,788) Preferred stock dividends (2,909) (2,909) (11,638) (14,669) -------- ------- -------- --------- Funds from operations(1) $103,608 $96,311 $405,336 $353,112 ======== ======= ======== ========= Per common share: - Basic $0.92 $0.87 $3.64 $3.30 ======== ======= ======== ========= - Diluted (2) $0.90 $0.85 $3.55 $3.23 ======== ======= ======== ========= Weighted Average Share Information Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2004 2003 -------- -------- ------- -------- Weighted average shares - - Basic 112,259 110,497 111,430 107,092 ======== ======== ======= ======== - Diluted (2) 117,011 114,965 115,955 111,168 ======== ======== ======= ======== (1) Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $1,607 and $1,502 for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $6,113 and $5,771 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.
