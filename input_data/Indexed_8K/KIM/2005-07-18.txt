Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. All years have been adjusted to reflect the impact of operating properties sold during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and properties classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, which are reflected in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of February 4, 2005, the Company's portfolio was comprised of 773 property interests, including 696 operating properties primarily consisting of neighborhood and community shopping centers, 32 retail store leases, 35 ground-up development projects and ten undeveloped parcels of land, totaling approximately 113.4 million square feet of leasable space located in 42 states, Canada and Mexico. The Company is self-administered and self-managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company. In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI") subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management's judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate. The Company's strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2004 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.57, effective for the first quarter of 2005. 7
Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting interest or has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives and valuation of real estate. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate The Company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. 8
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings 15 to 50 years Fixtures, building and leasehold improvements Terms of leases or useful (including certain identified intangible assets) lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income. Real estate under development on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development inventory of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion. These assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in management's opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances. Results of Operations Comparison 2004 to 2003 Revenues from rental property increased $42.9 million or 9.1% to $513.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $471.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2004 and 2003 providing incremental revenues of $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 93.6% at December 31, 2004, as compared to 90.7% at December 31, 2003 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding periods last year, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding period last year, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2004 and 2003. 9
Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $27.1 million or 13.1% to $233.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $206.5 million for the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2004 and 2003, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. Income from other real estate investments increased $7.3 million to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $22.8 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Company's Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $11.4 million during 2004, as compared to $4.6 million in 2003. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $3.8 million to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest and financing income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during 2004 as compared to the preceding year. Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.1 million to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $15.3 million in the corresponding period in 2003. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co-investment programs and fees earned from disposition services provided to various retailers. Other income/(expense), net increased approximately $14.3 million to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to a prior-year write-down in the carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Frank's Nursery, Inc., offset by increased income in 2004 from other equity investments. Interest expense increased $4.8 million or 4.7% to $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2004. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $6.1 million to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $38.4 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $0.9 million increase in professional fees, mainly attributable to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) a $1.6 million increase due to the expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted, (iii) increased staff levels related to the growth of the Company and (iv) other personnel-related costs, associated with a realignment of our regional operations. During 2003, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with three individual non-recourse mortgages encumbering three former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $14.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans, which aggregated approximately $24.0 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $9.7 million during 2003. 10
As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $14.1 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $42.3 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily attributable to the equity in income from the increased investment in the RioCan joint venture investment ("RioCan Venture"), the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio joint venture investment ("KROP") and the Company's growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2004 and 2003. During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co-investment ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2005, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, two operating properties for an aggregate sales price of $8.2 million, (ii) transferred two operating properties to KROP, as defined below, for an aggregate price of approximately $29.1 million, and (iii) transferred four operating properties to various co-investment ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $63.2 million. These transactions resulted in aggregate gains of approximately $4.0 million which were recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2005. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2005, the Company reclassified as held-for-sale three shopping center properties comprising approximately 0.4 million square feet of GLA. The book value of each of these properties, aggregating approximately $17.1 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $8.4 million, did not exceed each of their estimated fair values. As a result, no adjustment of property carrying value has been recorded. The Company's determination of the fair value for each of these properties, aggregating approximately $22.1 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. The current and prior comparative years operations of properties classified as held-for-sale as of March 31, 2005 are included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2003, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 10 operating shopping center properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $119.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $1.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, (ii) two regional malls for an aggregate sales price of approximately $135.6 million, (iii) one out-parcel for a sales price of approximately $8.1 million, (iv) transferred three operating properties to KROP for a price of approximately $144.2 million, (v) transferred an operating property to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling 10% interest for a price of approximately $21.9 million and (vi) terminated four leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $50.8 million. 11
During 2003, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144"). The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $19.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.0 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Company's determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $15.4 million, is based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $4.0 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144 is applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2004, KDI, the Company's wholly-owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold 28 out-parcels, three completed phases of projects and five recently completed projects for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, net of income taxes of approximately $4.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, KDI sold four projects and 26 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $134.6 million which resulted in gains of approximately $10.5 million, net of income taxes of $7.0 million. Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $280.6, compared to $242.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations improved $0.32 to $2.37 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $2.05 for the preceding year. This improved performance is primarily attributable to (i) the incremental operating results from the acquisition of operating properties during 2004 and 2003, including the Mid-Atlantic Realty Trust transaction (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K), (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures resulting from additional capital investments in the RioCan Venture, KROP and other joint venture investments for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties during 2004 and 2003, (iii) an increase in management and other fee income related to the growth in the co-investment programs, (iv) increased income from other real estate investments and (v) significant leasing within the portfolio, which improved operating profitability. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $297.1 million, compared to $307.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, net income decreased $0.11 to $2.51 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $2.62 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower income from discontinued operations of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the preceding year due to property sales during 2004 and 2003 and gains on early extinguishment of debt during 2003. In addition, the diluted per share results for the year ended December 31, 2003 were decreased by a reduction in net income available to common stockholders of $0.07 resulting from the deduction of original issuance costs associated with the redemption of the Company's 7 3/4% Class A, 8 1/2% Class B and 8 3/8% Class C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks during the second quarter of 2003. 12
Comparison 2003 to 2002 Revenues from rental property increased $46.9 million or 11.0% to $471.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $424.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of 55 operating properties during 2003, including 41 operating properties acquired in the Mid-Atlantic Merger, providing revenues of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) the full year impact related to the 13 operating properties acquired in 2002 providing incremental revenues of $16.6 million and (iii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 90.7% at December 31, 2003 as compared to 87.8% at December 31, 2002 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects, providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million as compared to the corresponding year ended December 31, 2002, offset by (iv) a decrease in revenues of approximately $8.4 million resulting from the bankruptcy filing of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart") and subsequent rejection of leases and (v) sales of certain properties and tenant buyouts resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $13.6 million as compared to the preceding year. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased $25.0 million or 13.8% to $206.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $181.4 million for the preceding year. The rental property expense components of operating and maintenance and depreciation and amortization increased approximately $24.0 million or 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to property acquisitions during 2003 and 2002 and increased snow removal costs during 2003. Income from other real estate investments increased $6.8 million to $22.8 million, as compared to $16.0 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased investment in the Company's preferred equity program contributing $4.6 million during 2003, as compared to $1.0 million in 2002, (ii) contribution of $12.1 million from the Kimsouth investment resulting from the disposition of 14 investment properties during 2003, offset by (iii) a decrease in income of $7.8 million from the Montgomery Ward Asset Designation rights transaction. Management and other fee income increased approximately $3.2 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased management and acquisition fees resulting from the growth of the KROP portfolio, (ii) increased management fees from KIR resulting from the growth of the KIR portfolio and (iii) increased property management activity providing incremental fee income of approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the preceding year. Interest expense increased $17.2 million or 20.2% to $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the preceding year, including additional borrowings and assumption of mortgage debt totaling approximately $616.0 million in connection with the Mid-Atlantic Merger. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased staff levels related to the growth of the Company, and (ii) other personnel-related costs associated with a realignment of our regional operations. During 2003, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with three individual non-recourse mortgages encumbering three former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $14.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans, which aggregated approximately $24.0 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $9.7 million during 2003. 13
During December 2002, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with four individual non-recourse mortgages encumbering four former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $24.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans, which aggregated approximately $46.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2002 that its investment in four operating properties, comprised of an aggregate 0.4 million square feet of GLA, with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and the lack of demand for the properties, the Company has reduced its potential holding period of these investments. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with a reassessment of the projected future operating cash flows of the properties and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in these assets was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value aggregating approximately $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $1.5 million relating to the adjustment of property carrying value for one of these properties is included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Provision for income taxes decreased $4.4 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily due to less taxable income provided by the Montgomery Ward Asset Designation Rights transaction in 2003 as compared to 2002. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $4.6 million to $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily attributable to the equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment, the RioCan joint venture investment and the KROP joint venture investment as described below. During 1998, the Company formed KIR, a limited partnership established to invest in high-quality retail properties financed primarily through the use of individual non-recourse mortgages. The Company has a 43.3% non-controlling limited partnership interest in KIR, which the Company manages, and accounts for its investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of KIR increased $1.6 million to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $18.2 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the Company's increased capital investment in KIR, totaling $13.0 million during 2003 and $23.8 million during 2002. The additional capital investments received by KIR from the Company and its other institutional partners were used to purchase additional shopping center properties throughout calendar years 2003 and 2002. During October 2001, the Company formed a joint venture (the "RioCan Venture") with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust ("RioCan", Canada's largest publicly traded REIT measured by gross leasable area ("GLA")), in which the Company has a 50% non-controlling interest, to acquire retail properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2003, the RioCan Venture consisted of 31 shopping center properties and three development projects with approximately 7.2 million square feet of GLA. The Company's equity in income from the RioCan Venture increased approximately $3.4 million to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $9.1 million for the preceding year. 14
During October 2001, the Company formed the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE"), which the Company manages and has a 20% non-controlling interest. The purpose of this venture is to acquire established, high-growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, KROP consisted of 23 shopping center properties with approximately 3.5 million square feet of GLA. The Company's equity in income from the KROP Venture increased approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $1.0 million for the preceding year. Minority interests in income of partnerships, net increased $5.5 million to $7.8 million as compared to $2.3 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the full year effect of the acquisition of a shopping center property acquired during October 2002, through a newly formed partnership by issuing approximately 2.4 million downREIT units valued at $80 million. The downREIT units are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the Company's common stock and are entitled to a distribution equal to the dividend rate of the Company's common stock multiplied by 1.1057. During 2003, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 10 operating shopping center properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $119.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $1.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, (ii) two regional malls for an aggregate sales price of approximately $135.6 million, (iii) one out-parcel for a sales price of approximately $8.1 million, (iv) transferred three operating properties to KROP for a price of approximately $144.2 million, which approximated their net book value, (v) transferred an operating property to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling 10% interest for a price of approximately $21.9 million, which approximated its net book value and (vi) terminated four leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $50.8 million. For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144 is applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2003, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $19.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.0 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Company's determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $15.4 million, is based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $4.0 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2002, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $28.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.9 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Company's determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $7.9 million, is based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $20.5 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for its wholly-owned development subsidiary, KDI. KDI is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion. During the year ended December 31, 2003, KDI sold four projects and 26 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $134.6 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $10.5 million, net of income taxes of $7.0 million. 15
During the year ended December 31, 2002, KDI sold four of its recently completed projects and eight out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $128.7 million, including the assignment of approximately $17.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, which resulted in profits of $9.5 million, net of income taxes of $6.4 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $307.9 million, as compared to $245.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.47 to $2.62 for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $2.15 for the preceding year. This improved performance is primarily attributable to (i) the acquisition of operating properties, including the Mid-Atlantic Merger, during 2003 and 2002, (ii) significant leasing within the portfolio, which improved operating profitability, (iii) increased contributions from KIR, the RioCan Venture and KROP, (iv) increased gains on development sales from KDI and (v) increased gains from operating property sales of $50.8 million in 2003, as compared to $12.8 million in 2002. The 2003 improvement also includes the impact from gains on early extinguishment of debt of $9.7 million in 2003, as compared to $22.3 million in 2002, and adjustments to property carrying values of $4.0 million in 2003 and $33.0 million in 2002. The 2003 diluted per share results were decreased by a reduction in net income available to common stockholders of $0.07 resulting from the deduction of original issuance costs associated with the redemption of the Company's 7 3/4% Class A, 8 1/2% Class B and 8?% Class C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks during the second quarter of 2003. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2004, the Company's five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Kohl's, Kmart Corporation and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.6%, 3.1%, 2.6%, 2.6% and 1.8% respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources It is management's intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's level of debt to total market capitalization was 24%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Company's IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $3.6 billion for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. 16
The Company has a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in June 2006. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2004, there was $230.0 million outstanding under this credit facility. During September 2004, the Company entered into a three-year Canadian denominated ("CAD") $150.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bears interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.50%, and is scheduled to expire in September 2007. Proceeds from this facility will be used for general corporate purposes including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2004, there was CAD $62.0 million (approximately USD $51.7 million) outstanding under this credit facility. The Company has a MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Company's debt maturities. As of February 18, 2005, the Company had $300.0 million available for issuance under the MTN program. (See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had over 350 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During May 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for up to $1.0 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. As of February 18, 2005, the Company had $309.7 million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $265.3 million in 2004, compared to $246.3 million in 2003 and $235.6 million in 2002. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward redevelopment projects during 2005 will be approximately $60.0 million to $80.0 million. Additionally, the Company anticipates its capital commitment toward ground-up development during 2005 will be approximately $160.0 million to $200.0 million. The proceeds from the sales of development properties and proceeds from construction loans in 2005 should be sufficient to fund the ground-up development capital requirements. 17
The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Cash flows from operations as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was $365.2 million for 2004, $308.6 million for 2003 and $278.9 million for 2002. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 20 years. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.2 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has certain shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Company's debt maturities and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): The Company has $200.3 million of medium term notes, $22.8 million of mortgage debt and $35.6 million of construction loans maturing in 2005. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities and new debt issuances. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion guarantees for certain construction projects, and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $45.9 million. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $5.8 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $4.0 million (approximately USD $3.3 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2004 relating to various development projects. In addition to the letter of credit facility, various additionally Canadian development projects in which the Company holds interests ranging from 33?% to 50% have letters of credit issued aggregating approximately CAD $2.2 million (approximately USD $1.8 million). During 2004, the Company obtained construction financing on 11 ground-up development projects for an aggregate loan commitment amount of up to $247.8 million. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 19 construction loans with total commitments of up to $413.3 million of which $156.6 million had been funded to the Company. These loans had maturities ranging from 2 to 36 months and interest rates ranging from 4.17% to 4.92% at December 31, 2004. 18
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These investments include the Company's 43.3% non-controlling interest in KIR, the Company's 50% non-controlling interest in the RioCan Venture, the Company's 20% non-controlling interest in KROP, the Company's 15% non-controlling interest in Price Legacy and varying non-controlling interests in other real estate joint ventures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents. The KIR joint venture was established for the purpose of investing in high quality real estate properties financed primarily with individual non-recourse mortgages. The Company believes that these properties are appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the Company traditionally uses. As of December 31, 2004, KIR had interests in 69 properties comprising 14.4 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2004, KIR had individual non-recourse mortgage loans on 68 of these properties. These non-recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from 2 to 15 years and rates ranging from 4.36% to 8.52%. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgages relating to the KIR joint venture was approximately $500.0 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) The RioCan Venture was established with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2004, the RioCan Venture consisted of 33 shopping center properties and three development projects with approximately 7.7 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2004, the RioCan Venture had individual, non-recourse mortgage loans on 33 of these properties aggregating approximately CAD $683.6 million (USD $569.8 million). These non-recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from one year to 29 years and rates ranging from 3.91% to 9.05%. As of December 31, 2004 the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgage loans relating to the RioCan Venture was approximately CAD $337.8 million (USD $281.6 million). (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") was established to acquire high-growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2004, KROP consisted of 37 shopping center properties with approximately 5.3 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2004, KROP had non-recourse mortgage loans totaling $454.5 million, with fixed rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.64% and variable rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.8% to LIBOR plus 2.5%. KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable-rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. At December 31, 2004 the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 5.33% per annum. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgage loans relating to the KROP joint venture was approximately $90.9 million. Additionally, the Company and GECRE may provide interim financing. All such financings bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 4.0% to LIBOR plus 5.25% and have maturities of less than a year. As of December 31, 2004, KROP had no outstanding short term interim financing due to the Company or GECRE. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) 19
During December 2004, the Company acquired the Price Legacy Corporation through a newly formed joint venture, PL Retail LLC ("PL Retail"), in which the Company has a non-controlling 15% interest. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture acquired 33 operating properties aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet of GLA located in ten states. As of December 31, 2004, PL Retail had approximately $850.6 million outstanding in non-recourse mortgage debt, of which approximately $513.4 million had fixed rates ranging from 4.66% to 9.00% and approximately $337.2 had variable rates ranging from 2.54% to 8.00%. The fixed-rate loans have maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years and the variable-rate loans have maturities ranging from 2 to 4 years. Additionally, the Company has provided PL Retail approximately $30.6 million of secured mezzanine financing. This interest only loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% and matures in December 2006. The Company also provided PL Retail a secured short-term promissory note of approximately $8.2 million. This interest only note bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% and matures on June 30, 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgages relating to PL Retail was approximately $127.6 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from 1% to 50%. As of December 31, 2004, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $778.0 million. The Company's pro-rata share of these non-recourse mortgages was approximately $261.1 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) Other Real Estate Investments During November 2002, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc., ("Kimsouth"). The Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Company's investment strategy with respect to Kimsouth includes re-tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. As a result of this strategy, Kimsouth has sold 26 properties as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Kimsouth portfolio was comprised of 12 properties, including the remaining office component of an operating property sold in 2004, totaling 2.1 million square feet of GLA with non-recourse mortgage debt of approximately $77.5 million encumbering the properties. All mortgages payable are collateralized by certain properties and are due in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2004, interest rates ranged from 4.06% to 6.68% and the weighted-average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 5.71% per annum. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgage loans relating to the Kimsouth portfolio was approximately $34.5 million. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Company's cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2004, eleven of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $24.2 million. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining 19 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $64.9 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. 20
During 2002, the Company established a preferred equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of shopping centers. The Company accounts for its investments in preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's invested capital in its preferred equity investments approximated $157.0 million relating to 62 shopping centers. As of December 31, 2004, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $548.3 million. Due to the Company's preferred position in these investments, the Company's pro-rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital. Effects of Inflation Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), the primary objective of which is to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the "primary beneficiary"). This new model applies when either (i) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional financial support. In addition, effective upon issuance, FIN 46 requires additional disclosures by the primary beneficiary and other significant variable interest holders. The provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 46-6, which deferred the effective date to December 31, 2003 for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests held by public companies in all VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. Additionally, in December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46 (R)"). The provisions of FIN 46(R) are effective as of March 31, 2004 for all non-special purpose entity ("non-SPE") interests held by public companies in all variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 (R) did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 21
The Company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Company's losses to the amount of its equity investment, and due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is limited to its carrying value in these investments. (See Notes 7 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153 Exchange of Non-monetary Assets - an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ("SFAS No. 153"). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The following table presents the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2004, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date (in millions). 22
As of December 31, 2004, the Company has Canadian investments totaling CAD $277.6 million (approximately USD $231.4 million) comprised of a real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of MXN 691.8 million (approximately USD $61.7 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt, foreign currency forward contracts (the "Forward Contracts") and a cross currency swap (the "CC Swap") with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap with major financial institutions. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this Item 8 is included as a separate section herein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 23
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kimco Realty Corporation: We have completed an integrated audit of Kimco Realty Corporation's 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 25
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLDIATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Business Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company" or "Kimco"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers which are anchored generally by discount department stores, supermarkets or drugstores. The Company also provides property management services for shopping centers owned by affiliated entities, various real estate joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, in connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI") subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2004, the Company's single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 1.2% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues and only 0.9% of the Company's total shopping center gross leasable area ("GLA"). At December 31, 2004, the Company's five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Kohl's, Kmart Corporation, and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.6%, 3.1%, 2.6%, 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. The principal business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is the ownership, development, management and operation of retail shopping centers, including complementary services that capitalize on the Company's established retail real estate expertise. The Company does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Principles of Consolidation and Estimates The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest or has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") require the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate, depreciable lives, revenue recognition and the collectability of trade accounts receivable. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 32
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Real Estate Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. If there is an event or a change in circumstances that indicates that the basis of a property (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable, then management will assess any impairment in value by making a comparison of (i) the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life and (ii) the net carrying amount of the property. If the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property "as-if-vacant". The fair value reflects the depreciated replacement cost of the permanent assets, with no trade fixtures included. In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases and management's estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions (i.e., expense recapture, base rental changes, etc.) measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases. In determining the value of in-place leases, management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related costs based on current market demand. In estimating the value of tenant relationships, management considers the nature and extent of the existing tenant relationship, the expectation of lease renewals, growth prospects, and tenant credit quality, among other factors. The value assigned to in-place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the estimated remaining term of the leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, all unamortized costs relating to that lease would be written off. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Buildings 15 to 50 years Fixtures, building and leasehold improvements Terms of leases or useful (including certain identified intangible assets) lives, whichever is shorter
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. 33
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Real Estate Under Development Real estate under development represents the ground-up development inventory of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion. These properties are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. The Company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Company's losses to the amount of its equity investment; and due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is limited to its carrying value in these investments. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders' equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. All debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Deferred Leasing and Financing Costs Costs incurred in obtaining tenant leases and long-term financing, included in deferred charges and prepaid expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized over the terms of the related leases or debt agreements, as applicable. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. 34
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company has made an election to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. In connection with the RMA, which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in certain activities which it was previously precluded from in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. As such, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions Assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and the Company's expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in OCI, as a separate component of the Company's stockholders' equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effect of the transaction's gain or loss is included in the caption Other income/(expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivative/Financial Instruments Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133"), as amended by SFAS No. 149 in April 2003 to clarify accounting and reporting for derivative instruments. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. This accounting standard requires the Company to measure derivative instruments at fair value and to record them in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the Company's rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. In addition, the fair value adjustments will be recorded in either stockholders' equity or earnings in the current period based on the designation of the derivative. The effective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency hedges that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation component of OCI in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, to the extent they are economically effective and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged investments are sold or otherwise disposed of. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of hedges are recorded in earnings for the current period. 35
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market fluctuation on equity securities. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Additionally, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions. The principal financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, these derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow, fair value or foreign currency hedges (see Note 16). Earnings Per Share The following table sets forth the reconciliation of earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data): 36
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued (a) The effect of the assumed conversion of downREIT units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. The Company maintains a stock option plan (the "Plan"), for which prior to January 1, 2003, the Company accounted for under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25). Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("SFAS No. 148"), which will apply the recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123") to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. Awards under the Company's Plan generally vest ratably over a three-year term and expire ten years from the date of grant. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding stock awards in each period (amounts presented in thousands, expect per share data): 37
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued These pro forma adjustments to net income and net income per diluted common share assume fair values of each option grant estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The more significant assumptions underlying the determination of such fair values for options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 include: (i) weighted average risk-free interest rates of 3.30%, 2.84% and 3.06%, respectively; (ii) weighted average expected option lives of 3.72 years, 3.8 years and 4.1 years, respectively; (iii) weighted average expected volatility of 16.69%, 15.26% and 16.12%, respectively, and (iv) weighted average expected dividend yield of 5.59%, 6.25% and 6.87%, respectively. The per share weighted average fair value at the dates of grant for options awarded during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4.27, $2.35 and $1.50, respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), the primary objective of which is to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the "primary beneficiary"). This new model applies when either (i) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional financial support. In addition, effective upon issuance, FIN 46 requires additional disclosures by the primary beneficiary and other significant variable interest holders. The provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 46-6, which deferred the effective date to December 31, 2003 for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests held by public companies in all VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. Additionally, in December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46(R)"). The provisions of FIN 46(R) are effective as of March 31, 2004 for all non-special purpose entity ("non-SPE") interests held by public companies in all variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46(R) did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchange of Non-monetary Assets - an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ("SFAS No. 153"). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts have been made to conform with the current year presentation. 38

Adjustment of Property Carry Values: As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in December 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a book value of approximately $3.8 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.6 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million to reflect the property's estimated fair value. The Company's determination of estimated fair value is based upon third-party purchase offers less estimated closing costs. The Company determined in 2002 that its investment in four operating properties comprised of an aggregate 0.4 million square feet of GLA, with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.8 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the properties, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of these investments. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with a reassessment of the potential future operating cash flows of the properties and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in these assets was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying values aggregating approximately $12.5 million in 2002, of which approximately $1.5 million is included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 41

The Company and its subsidiaries have varying equity interests in these real estate joint ventures, which may differ from their proportionate share of net income or loss recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is limited to its carrying value in these investments. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's carrying value in these investments approximated $595.2 million and $487.4 million, respectively. 8. Other Real Estate Investments: Ward Venture - During March 2001, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, the Company formed a real estate joint venture (the "Ward Venture"), in which the Company has a 50% interest, for purposes of acquiring asset designation rights for substantially all of the real estate property interests of the bankrupt estate of Montgomery Ward LLC and its affiliates. These asset designation rights have provided the Ward Venture the ability to direct the ultimate disposition of the 315 fee and leasehold interests held by the bankrupt estate. The asset designation rights expired in August 2002 for the leasehold positions and expired in December 2004 for the fee owned locations. During the marketing period, the Ward Venture was responsible for all carrying costs associated with the properties until the property was designated to a user. As of December 31, 2004, there was one remaining property which was sold pursuant to an installment sales agreement. Per the agreement, the purchase price for this property will be paid by November 15, 2006. During 2004, the Ward Venture completed transactions on four properties and the Company recognized pre-tax profits of approximately $2.5 million. During 2003, the Ward Venture completed transactions on seven properties and the Company recognized pre-tax profits of approximately $3.5 million. During 2002, the Ward Venture completed transactions on 32 properties and the Company recognized pre-tax profits of approximately $11.3 million. Leveraged Lease - During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Company's cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). During 2002, four of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $9.6 million. During 2003, four properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $9.1 million. During 2004, an additional three properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $5.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining 19 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $64.9 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this obligation has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. 48

Fair Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments: All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies, reasonably approximate their fair values except those listed below, for which fair values are reflected. The valuation method used to estimate fair value for fixed-rate debt and minority interests relating to mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests associated with finite-lived subsidiaries of the Company is based on discounted cash flow analyses. The fair values for marketable securities are based on published or securities dealers' estimated market values. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition. The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimate of fair value differs from the carrying amounts (in thousands): 16. Financial Instruments - Derivatives and Hedging: The Company is exposed to the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and market value fluctuations of equity securities. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives. The principal financial instruments periodically used by the Company are interest-rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts. The Company, from time to time, hedges the future cash flows of its floating-rate debt instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate risk, principally through interest-rate swaps with major financial institutions. The Company had interest-rate swap agreements on its $85.0 million floating-rate MTN and on its $100.0 million floating-rate remarketed reset notes, which were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges of the variability in floating-rate interest payments on the hedged debt. The Company determined that these swap agreements were highly effective in offsetting future variable-interest cash flows related to the Company's debt portfolio. The swap agreement relating to the Company's $100.0 million floating-rate remarketed reset notes matured in August 2003. This agreement was not renewed as the Company elected to pay off its outstanding $100.0 million floating-rate remarketed reset notes during 2003. The swap agreement relating to the Company's $85.0 million floating-rate MTN matured in November 2003. This MTN matured and was paid in full during August 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the change in the fair value of the interest-rate swaps was $0.6 million, which was recorded in OCI, a component of stockholders' equity, with a corresponding liability reduction for the same amount. The Company had no interest-rate swaps outstanding during 2004. 56
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of its Canadian investments in real estate aggregating approximately CAD $184.6 million. In addition, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts and a cross-currency swap with an aggregate notional amount of approximately MXN 82.4 million and MXN 381.8 million (approximately USD $7.4 million and $34.0 million) designated as hedges of its Mexican real estate investments at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2003, the Company sold 50% of its Mexican investments and assigned approximately MXN 156.9 million of the MXN hedges in connection with the sale of the underlying investments that were being hedged. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had remaining Mexican net investment hedges outstanding with a notional amount of approximately MXN 82.4 million and MXN 224.9 million, respectively. The Company has designated these foreign currency agreements as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in Canadian and Mexican real estate operations. The Company believes these agreements are highly effective in reducing the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. As such, gains and losses on these net investment hedges were reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. During 2004 and 2003, $15.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively, of unrealized losses and $0.0 and $0.2 million, respectively, of unrealized gains were included in the cumulative translation adjustment relating to the Company's net investment hedges of its Canadian and Mexican investments. During 2001, the Company acquired warrants to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock of a Canadian REIT. The Company designated the warrants as a cash flow hedge of the variability in expected future cash outflows upon purchasing the common stock. The Company exercised its warrants in October 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the change in fair value of the warrants exercised resulted in a reduction of the unrealized gain of approximately $8.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the change in fair value of the warrants resulted in an increase in the unrealized gain of approximately $6.0 million. These changes were recorded in OCI with a corresponding change in Other assets for the same amount. The following table summarizes the notional values and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: 57
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, these derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of $38.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively, and other assets of $0.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively. The Company does not expect to reclassify to earnings any of the current balance during the next 12 months. 17.

During June 2003, the Company issued 7,000,000 Depositary Shares (the "Class F Depositary Shares"), each such Class F Depositary Share representing a one-tenth fractional interest of a share of the Company's 6.65% Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class F Preferred Stock"). Dividends on the Class F Depositary Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears at the rate of 6.65% per annum based on the $25.00 per share initial offering price, or $1.6625 per annum. The Class F Depositary Shares are redeemable, in whole or part, for cash on or after June 5, 2008 at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Depositary Share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.

Net proceeds from the sale of the Class F Depositary Shares, totaling approximately $169.0 million (after related transaction costs of $6.0 million) were used to redeem all of the Company's Class B Preferred Stock and Class C Preferred Stock and to fund a portion of the redemption of the Company's Class A Preferred Stock. Voting Rights - As to any matter on which the Class F Preferred Stock, ("Preferred Stock") may vote, including any action by written consent, each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to 10 votes, each of which 10 votes may be directed separately by the holder thereof. With respect to each share of Preferred Stock, the holder thereof may designate up to 10 proxies, with each such proxy having the right to vote a whole number of votes (totaling 10 votes per share of Preferred Stock). As a result, each Class F Depositary Share is entitled to one vote. Liquidation Rights - In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, the Preferred Stock holders are entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its stockholders, a liquidation preference of $250.00 per share ($25.00 per Class F Depositary Share), plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of the Company's common stock or any other capital stock that ranks junior to the Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. 58
