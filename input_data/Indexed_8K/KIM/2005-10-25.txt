On a per share basis, net income increased 9.1 percent to $0.36 from $0.33 reported in the third quarter of 2004. All prior period amounts presented have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2-for-1 stock split that was effective August 8, 2005.

On a per share basis, third quarter FFO increased 13.6 percent to $0.50 from $0.44 a year ago. Quarterly FFO excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties net of minority interests and joint venture properties of approximately $5.6 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2005 and approximately $8.0 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2004.

For the quarter, Kimco signed 128 new leases in the portfolio totaling 690,500 square feet and 65 lease renewals totaling 415,300 square feet. Year to date the Company has signed 334 new leases in this portfolio totaling approximately 1.8 million square feet and 254 lease renewals totaling 1.7 million square feet. The average increase in base rent for new leases signed for same space leases was 11.4 percent and 10.6 percent for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. Occupancy in the Company's combined operating portfolio encompassing approximately 108.5 million square feet of gross leasable area was 94.8 percent, 90 basis points higher than a year ago.
Investment Activity Kimco has acquired property interests totaling $544 million for the Company's core portfolio, co-investment programs and international portfolios since the end of the second quarter. A summary of the significant investments is as follows: - Kimco acquired all the shares of GDE Properties Corporation, a private entity that owned a portfolio of three supermarket anchored properties located in Southern and Central California for approximately $104.5 million. The properties are Marigold Center, Laband Village and Plaza di Northridge. Marigold Center, located in San Luis Obispo, California, contains 175,000 square feet of gross leasable area and is anchored by Vons, Michaels and Sav-on Drug. Laband Village located in Chino Hills, California, is a 73,000 square foot neighborhood shopping center anchored by Stater Bros. Market, the largest privately owned supermarket chain in Southern California. Plaza di Northridge in Northridge, California, is a 160,000 square foot, 100 percent leased shopping center anchored by Gelson's supermarket, Linens-N-Things and DSW. These properties will remain in Kimco's parent portfolio. - Kimco acquired four shopping centers for the Company's co-investment programs totaling $146 million. Stafford Marketplace, a 332,000 square foot shopping center located in Stafford, Virginia, was purchased for approximately $80.0 million. This shopping center is anchored by Shoppers Food Warehouse, TJ Maxx, Pier 1 Imports, Borders and several other national tenants. Yorkshire Plaza located in Aurora, Illinois, was also acquired for approximately $29.7 million. Yorkshire Plaza is 362,000 square feet and anchored by Best Buy, Value City, Pier I Imports and Sportsmart. The Company also acquired Greeley Commons in Greeley, Colorado, and North Quincy Plaza in Quincy, Massachusetts. Greeley Commons is a 139,000 square foot shopping center anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, Michaels, Petco and Circuit City and is currently 100 percent leased. North Quincy Plaza is an 80,510 square foot in-fill neighborhood center anchored by Victory Supermarket and Brooks Pharmacy. These properties were acquired for an aggregate cost of approximately $36.0 million. - In addition, Kimco formed a new joint venture with a new institutional partner and transferred a previously acquired portfolio of 45 net leased properties to the venture. Kimco is also under contract to purchase Doc Stone Market located in Stafford, Virginia, for this venture. Doc Stone Market is a 100,000 square foot center anchored by Giant Food, Petco and Staples, valued at approximately $17.2 million. - In Mexico, Kimco formed a strategic joint venture with American Industries, a leading real estate owner and operator in Mexico. Kimco invested approximately $55 million to acquire a 50 percent interest in American Industries' portfolio of 57 net leased industrial, warehouse and distribution facilities. The portfolio has a gross value of approximately $277 million and the tenant leases are triple net, U.S. Dollar denominated obligations of U.S. and multi-national tenants. - Also in Mexico, Kimco invested $2.6 million to acquire an interest in a development to be anchored by Walmart. The project will be a 105,000 square foot multi-tenant shopping center located in the city of Tuxtepec in the State of Oaxaca. Kimco now has an ownership interest in 70 properties in Mexico with a gross real estate value of approximately $475 million. In addition, Kimco made several opportunistic investments through its Kimco Select Investment and Retail Property Solutions business lines. Kimco's Retail Property Solutions team participated in the successful recapitalization and emergence from bankruptcy of Frank's Nursery and Crafts, which has been renamed FNC Realty. At emergence, FNC Realty consisted of 55 properties of which, eight were subsequently sold. The remaining properties are being leased, redeveloped or marketed for sale by Kimco. Kimco Select invested approximately $14 million to purchase an interest in One City Center, an office building located in Houston, Texas. The building is predominantly leased to credit tenants with long term leases and was purchased well below replacement cost. Kimco Select, through a joint venture, also purchased a 90 percent interest in a first mortgage receivable with a principal amount due of $46.7 million at a significant discount. The Company also agreed to provide up to $33 million of construction financing for a 388,412 square foot Target-anchored retail center in Richland Township, Pennsylvania. In addition to receiving interest income from the loan, Kimco will receive an ownership position in the completed project.
Kimco's preferred equity investment program continued to provide a meaningful contribution to FFO and growth in the Company's invested assets. During the quarter, two preferred equity investments were redeemed and Kimco realized profit participation of approximately $4.4 million. Five new preferred equity investments were initiated during the quarter totaling approximately $21.4 million of new investment, including one Canadian property in Kamloops, British Columbia, and domestically in properties in San Marcos, Texas; Sarasota, Florida; Lansing, Illinois; and Hamilton, New Jersey. Kimco's merchant building business, Kimco Developers Inc. (KDI), completed the sale of one shopping center and sold portions of five additional projects generating proceeds of $59.6 million. These property sales resulted in gains on sales of approximately $8.1 million, net of tax. Several pad sites and one additional shopping center are currently under contract for sale in the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition, KDI acquired land for six new projects for a total of $67.9 million and invested an additional $87.6 million in its pipeline of 31 shopping center developments. Increased Earnings Guidance As a result of the Company's continued strong operating results, Kimco's management increased its projection for FFO per share to $1.96 for the full year ending December 31, 2005. This estimate is $0.02 per share above the high end of the range of guidance management provided last quarter. Management also increased guidance for FFO per share for the year ending December 2006 to between $2.09 and $2.14, which represents growth in FFO of between 7.0 percent and 9.0 percent. Management's increase was from prior guidance for 2006 of between $2.07 per share to $2.10 per share. Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 45 years. Kimco owns and operates the nation's largest portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers with interests in 946 properties comprising approximately 127.0 million square feet of leasable space located throughout 43 states, Canada and Mexico.

Kimco Realty Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (In thousands, except per share data) Weighted Average Share Information Note: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation. (1) Included in the calculation of income from continuing operations per share in accordance with SEC guidelines. (2) The potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included.
Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) Weighted Average Share Information (1) Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $1,739 and $1,502 for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $4,953 and $4,506 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.
Kimco Realty Corporation Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (In thousands, except share data)
Kimco Realty Corporation Reconciliation of Projected Diluted Net Income Per Common Share to Projected Funds From Operations Per Common Share Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management's estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
