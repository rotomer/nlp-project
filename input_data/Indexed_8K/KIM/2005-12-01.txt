WHEREAS, the respective Board of Directors or Board of Trustees, as applicable, of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Company with and into Merger Sub (the "MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; WHEREAS, a Special Committee of the Board of Trustees (the "SPECIAL COMMITTEE") and the Board of Trustees of the Company has received the written opinion of Robert A.

When used in this Merger Agreement, the term "EFFECTIVE TIME" shall mean the time at which such articles are accepted for record by the Department. SECTION 1.4 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time, have all the effects provided by the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and other than as provided herein, all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, conveyances, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, the title to any property or rights of the Company to be vested in the Surviving Corporation, by reason of, or as a result of, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors may execute and deliver all such deeds, conveyances, assignments and assurances in law and do all things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to such property or rights in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and that the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action. ARTICLE 2 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION AND CONVERSION OF SHARES SECTION 2.1 CHARTER. The charter of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Charter of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, except that the change of name described in the articles of merger shall be effective as an amendment thereto, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 2

SECTION 2.3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS; OFFICERS. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until the earlier of their respective resignations or the time that their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. SECTION 2.4 MERGER CONSIDERATION. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder of the Company, each outstanding share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") shall be converted into and represent the right to receive a number of shares (subject to clause (b) below) of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK") equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration (as such term is defined in clause (a) below) (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"); provided, however, if between the date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the amounts of cash per share and Parent Common Stock per share shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. (a) The "PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION" shall be a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) Total Stock Consideration by (II) Total Company Shares. "TOTAL STOCK CONSIDERATION" shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount by which (x) the sum of (A) Eighty Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($82,500,000), (B) the aggregate amount of the Company's and its Subsidiary's cash and cash equivalents on hand or in bank accounts as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (net of amounts of outstanding checks or transfers) and (C) all Lease Expenses exceeds (y) the sum of (aa) the amount of the Company Merger Expenses and (bb) the REIT Dividend Amount (to the extent not previously paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.6) and (cc) the 2005 Dividend (to the extent not previously paid) by (ii) the Market Price. "TOTAL COMPANY SHARES" means the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The "MARKET PRICE" shall equal the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") (or, if not listed on such date on the NYSE, such other exchange on which such shares are then listed) of shares of Parent Common Stock on the final full trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The term "Lease Expenses" means all leasing commissions, tenant improvement costs, legal fees and related expenses with respect to (i) the Telco Stores Lease and (ii) leases entered into following the date hereof and in accordance with Section 5.3(vi). (b) FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this Section 2.4, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common Stock receiving fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange pursuant to 3
Section 2.6, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (x) the Market Price by (y) the fractional interest in Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder). On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the chief financial officer of the Company shall deliver to the Merger Sub a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent and signed on behalf of the Company setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the nature and amount of each of the Company Merger Expenses (whether previously paid or not), (ii) the REIT Dividend Amount, (iii) the 2005 Dividend, if any, (iv) the aggregate amount of the Company's and its Subsidiary's cash and cash equivalents on hand or in bank accounts as of the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (net of amounts of outstanding checks or transfers) and (iv) the Lease Expenses. (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY MERGER EXPENSES" means all (i) brokerage or similar fees, (ii) legal and accounting fees and disbursements, (iii) advisory, consulting and severance fees and expenses, (iv) printing and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filing fees and expenses, (v) Transfer Taxes (as such term is defined in Section 5.10) regardless of whether such Transfer Taxes are the obligation of the Company and its Subsidiary or the obligation of Parent and its Subsidiaries but excluding any such Transfer Taxes that are the obligation of any shareholder (other than the Parent and its affiliates) solely in their capacity as a shareholder, (vi) all GAAP Liabilities (including all accounts payable and accrued expenses, and any roll-back property taxes actually assessed and, to the extent applicable, excluding the 2005 Dividend and the Special Dividend), and (vii) other unpaid fees and expenses incurred or accrued by the Company and its Subsidiary, which in each case have not been paid on or prior to the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. SECTION 2.5 COMPANY SPECIAL DIVIDEND. The Company shall declare and pay, in accordance with Section 2.6, a dividend (the "SPECIAL DIVIDEND") to its shareholders, the record date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date. The Special Dividend shall be in an amount equal to the dividend the Company, in consultation with Parent, reasonably determines is necessary for the Company to declare and pay in order to qualify as a REIT (as such term is defined in Section 3.9) for its taxable year commencing on January 1, 2006 and ended on the Closing Date (the "REIT DIVIDEND AMOUNT") and the per share amount of the REIT Dividend Amount shall be an amount equal to the REIT Dividend Amount divided by the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the "PER SHARE REIT DIVIDEND AMOUNT"). SECTION 2.6 PAYMENT. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as an exchange agent hereunder for purposes of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.4. Parent and Merger Sub agree to make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(b). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company 4
will deposit with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions, if any, including the REIT Dividend Amount and, to the extent not previously paid, the 2005 Dividend. (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall pay the Per Share REIT Dividend Amount and to the extent not previously paid, the 2005 Dividend Amount to holders of record on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with customary procedures for the payment of dividends, and to mail to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Closing Date (i) a letter of transmittal, including if applicable a form of election, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the Company Common Stock held by such shareholder ("CERTIFICATES") to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Per Share Stock Consideration that such shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such shareholder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4(a) and Section 2.5, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and any unpaid dividends and other distributions, if any, ("CASH PAYMENTS"). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Cash Payments. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration and any Cash Payments to which such holder is entitled, may be issued with respect to the Company Common Stock to such transferee if such shareholder's Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. (c) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration which remains undistributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this ARTICLE 2 shall thereafter look only to Surviving Corporation for payment of any Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE 2. None of Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash and securities held by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for payment pursuant to this ARTICLE 2 delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 5
SECTION 2.7 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as it determines is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to holders of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. SECTION 2.8 NO FURTHER RIGHTS. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, except as provided herein (including the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) the Per Share REIT Dividend Amount, (iii) any unpaid 2005 Dividend amount and (iv) any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.4 (b)) or by law. SECTION 2.9 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall be made thereafter. In the event that, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock represented as provided in Section 2.4. SECTION 2.10 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding Section 2.8 hereof, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Title 3. Subtitle 2. of the MGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Title 3. Subtitle 2. of the MGCL and pursuant to the Maryland Business Combination Act; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his or her right to appraisal and payment under the MGCL, such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.4 hereof, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. ARTICLE 3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: SECTION 3.1 ORGANIZATION. The Company is a real estate investment trust and its Subsidiary is a corporation, each duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, as applicable, and each of the Company and its Subsidiary has all requisite real estate investment trust or corporate power 6

Each of the Company and its Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company owns directly all of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of its Subsidiary free and clear of any liens and encumbrances. The Company does not directly or indirectly own any capital stock or other proprietary interest in any person other than its Subsidiary. SECTION 3.2 CAPITALIZATION.

director, agent or otherwise, nor will it authorize or permit any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative acting on its behalf to (A) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or assistance), or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly (including through any option, right to acquire or other beneficial ownership), of 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or assets representing a material portion of the assets of the Company or the Property, other than by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, share exchange, recapitalization, other business combination, liquidation, or other action out of the ordinary course of business of the Company, other than with the Parent or its Subsidiaries, (iii) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a "COMPETING PROPOSAL"), (iv) the withdrawal by the Company's Board of Trustees of its Company Board Recommendation or (B) enter into, participate or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction, or (C) agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction; PROVIDED, THAT, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company's Board of Trustees or the Special Committee (and the officers, trustees, agents, and financial advisors of the Company acting at the direction of the Company's Board of Trustees or the Special Committee) may furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any person that previously has made an unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal if, and only to the extent that (I) the Company's Board of Trustees, after consultation with and having considered the advise of independent outside legal counsel, determines in good faith, that (i) such Competing Proposal would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined), and (ii) the failure to engage in such negotiations or discussions or provide such information would constitute a breach of the duties of the Board of Trustees of the Company under the Company's declaration of trust or applicable law, (II) prior to taking such action, the Company (i) provides reasonable notice to Parent (but in any event no later than 48 hours prior to taking such action) to the effect that it is taking such action and (ii) receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form, and (III) the Company notifies the Acquiring Entities as promptly as practicable of all of the relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which the Company or its Subsidiary or any such officer, director, employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative may receive relating to any of such matters, and, if such inquiry or proposal is in writing, the Company shall deliver to the Acquiring Entities a copy of such inquiry or proposal. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the preceding, the Company shall provide the Parent with a copy of any Competing Proposal or amendments or supplements thereto, and promptly inform Parent of the status of any discussions or negotiations with such a third party, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a copy of any information delivered to such person that has not previously been reviewed by Parent. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Competing Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit the Company's 31
Board of Trustees from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer. (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(b), the Company Board of Trustees will not approve or recommend or permit the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described in Section 5.4(a)) made by any person other than Parent or Merger Sub or, except as set forth in this Section 5.4(b) or in Section 5.1(c), make a Change in the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject thereto, if the Company Board of Trustees, after having considered the advice of independent outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that failing to take such action would constitute a breach of the obligations of the Company Board of Trustees under the Company's declaration of trust or applicable law, the Company Board of Trustees may, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, approve or recommend a Competing Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto) or cause the Company to enter into an agreement with respect thereto or make a Change in the Company Board Recommendation, but in each case only if (i) the Company provides written notice to Parent (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"), which notice must be received by Parent at least five Business Days (exclusive of the day of receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Proposal) prior to the time it intends to cause the Company to enter into such an agreement, advising Parent in writing that the Company Board of Trustees has received a Competing Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto) which it believes constitutes a Superior Proposal and which it intends to accept and, with respect to which, enter into a definitive agreement, subject to the provisions of this Section 5.4(b), providing a copy of any written offer or proposal describing the Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, (ii) as of the end of such five Business Day period referenced above, Parent shall have failed to notify the Company in writing that it has determined to revise the terms of the Merger to provide that the Merger Consideration will be equal to or greater than the consideration to be paid to the Company stockholders pursuant to the Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with the requirements of Section 7.1(h) within 48 hours after the lapse of the five-day period referenced above and immediately thereafter enters into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide Competing Proposal not directly or indirectly initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Company after the date of this Agreement in contravention of the provisions hereof which the Company Board of Trustees or the Special Committee determines in good faith judgment (based on the advice of the Financial Advisor or another investment banker of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the tax consequences of such Competing Proposal to the Company and its shareholders, and the person making the proposal, (i) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company's shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders), from a financial point of view, than the Merger and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes of this definition, the term Competing Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a) except that the reference to 10 percent in the definition of "Competing Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to 100 percent. SECTION 5.5 INFORMATION AND ACCESS. Subject to and without limiting the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of March 28, 2005 by and between the Company and 32
Parent (as amended, the "INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT"), from the date hereof until the Closing Date, (i) each party hereto and its respective Subsidiaries shall afford to the other party and such other party's accountants, counsel and other representatives full and reasonable access during normal business hours (and at such other times as the parties may mutually agree) to its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records and personnel and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to such other party (1) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable laws, and (2) all other information concerning their businesses, personnel and (with respect to the Company) the Property as such other party may reasonably request. Such other party and its accountants, counsel and other representatives shall, in the exercise of the rights described in this Section, not unduly interfere with the operation of the businesses of the party providing the access and information. SECTION 5.6 EMPLOYEE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, (i) all employment and consulting agreements and other contracts to which the Company or its Subsidiary are parties set forth on SCHEDULE 5.6 hereto and (ii) obligations to the Company's employees and former employees under the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"); provided, however, nothing herein shall require the Acquiring Entities to pay or reimburse the Company's employees or former employees for any COBRA related costs they are responsible for paying under applicable law. SECTION 5.7 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Parent agrees that (i) all rights to indemnification existing in favor of any trustee, officer, employee, or agent of the Company and its Subsidiary (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided in their respective declaration of trust, by-laws or comparable organizational documents or in indemnification or reimbursement agreements with the Company or its Subsidiary, or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof, in each case to the extent provided to Parent prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years and ninety days from the Effective Time; provided that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year and ninety day period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims. Parent also agrees to, from and after the Closing, indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals' services as officers, trustees, employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiary, or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of employees or trustees of, or otherwise on behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiary, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any capacity in any Action in connection with any matter, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will pay as incurred such Indemnified Party's reasonable legal fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of enforcing this indemnity) of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith, to the extent not prohibited by the MGCL and upon receipt of any affirmation and undertaking required by the MGCL; 33
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent and the Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm with respect to each related matter except to the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any issue between positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a "tail policy" providing coverage substantially similar to the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company for a six year period from and after the Effective Time; provided, that the Company shall not pay more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for such insurance policy and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.7, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for a premium equal to such maximum amount; provided, further, to the extent any premiums for such insurance policy have not been paid prior to the last Business Day before the Closing Date such premiums shall be considered Company Merger Expenses. (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in this Section 5.7 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. (d) The obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.7 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7). SECTION 5.8 REORGANIZATION. From and after the date hereof and until the Effective Time, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall (i) knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, that would jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; or (ii) enter into any Contract, commitment or arrangement with respect to the foregoing. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to conduct its business in a manner that would not jeopardize the characterization of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. SECTION 5.9 LISTING APPLICATION. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock which are to be issued in the Merger to be listed for trading on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance prior to the Closing Date.

Other than to the extent included in Company Merger Expenses and deducted from the Merger 34
Consideration, all obligations with respect to Transfer Taxes from and after the Effective Time, shall be obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent as the case may be, and shall not be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the holders of Company Common Stock. SECTION 5.11 TAX RETURNS. The Company shall timely prepare and file or shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company, prior to filing such Tax Returns, shall provide Parent copies of such proposed Tax Returns at least 30 days prior to the due date thereof (other than payroll tax returns, which shall be provided as soon as possible after the filing thereof), such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with this Agreement and past practice and, in the event that the Parent reasonably objects to any item in such Tax Returns, the Company shall make (or cause to be made) such revisions to such proposed tax returns as are reasonably requested by the Parent. In the event that the Company and its Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, cannot reach an agreement with respect to such Tax Return prior to the Closing Date and it is possible to extend the time to file until a date after the Closing Date (taking multiple extensions into account), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiary to, not file such Tax Return and instead request an extension of time within which to file such Tax Return until after the Closing Date, in which event Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, such Tax Return after the Closing Date. SECTION 5.12 GUARANTY. Parent hereby agrees to take all actions within its power to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. SECTION 5.13 AFFILIATES.

The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to deliver to Parent not later than ten days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT A hereto (an "AFFILIATE AGREEMENT"). SECTION 5.14 ESTOPPELS.

Each of the Tenant Estoppels shall be dated effective as of no earlier than the 30th day prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub each executed original Tenant Estoppel. 35
SECTION 5.15 CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION. (a) Prior to Closing, in the event of any damage to or destruction of all or part of the Property (notice of which shall be given to Merger Sub by the Company as soon as practicable following its occurrence), then the Company shall promptly repair or replace such damage or destruction, except that if the cost of such repair or replacement exceeds $1,000,000, or the damage would take more than sixty (60) days to repair or rebuild, then in any such case Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving the Company written notice of its intention to do so, such notice by Merger Sub to the Company to be given not later than seven (7) days after Merger Sub shall have received the notice from the Company of such aforesaid occurrence. (b) In the event that any governmental authority having jurisdiction of all or part of the Property notifies the Company or its Subsidiary before the Closing that some alteration of or addition to the Property is required to be made by law, rule or regulation (notice of which shall be given to Merger Sub by the Company as soon as practicable after its receipt) or otherwise requires a cure of a violation, then the Company shall promptly undertake such alteration or addition or cure and shall accomplish the same before the date of Closing; provided, however, that if the cost of such alteration or addition or cure shall exceed $1,000,000, then in such event Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice given to the Company within fifteen (15) days after the Company has given Merger Sub the aforesaid notice. (c) In the event that any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings affecting the Property shall be threatened, contemplated, commenced or consummated prior to the Closing (notice of which shall be given to Merger Sub by the Company as soon as practicable after receipt by the Company or its Subsidiary), Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, by written notice given to the Company within fifteen (15) days after the Company has given Merger Sub the aforesaid notice. SECTION 5.16 TITLE INSURANCE POLICY. (a) Parent has obtained an Owners Title Insurance Commitment (the "Title Commitment") with respect to the Property prior to the date of this Agreement from First American Title Insurance Company of New York (the "Title Insurer"), pursuant to which the Title Insurer has committed to insure Subsidiary's fee simple title to the Property. Parent has previously delivered a true and complete copy of the Title Commitment to the Company. The Parent hereby acknowledges that the Title Commitment does not reveal any Encumbrances, Property Restrictions or other defects of title that are not Company Permitted Encumbrances. Parent shall notify the Company in writing of any Encumbrances, Property Restrictions or other defects of title, which are not Company Permitted Encumbrances, disclosed in any update or continuation of the Title Commitment within ten Business Days of Parent's receipt thereof (and provide the Company within such ten-Business Day period with true and complete copies of any such Encumbrances, Property Restrictions or other defects of title). After receipt of Parent's notice of title objections, the Company shall have the right, exercisable by providing Parent notice within 10 Business Days of Company's receipt of Parent's notice of title objections, to give notice to Parent of its election not to cure same (or its inability to do so) (a "Non-Cure Notice") and in the event that (a) a Non-Cure Notice is delivered, (b) the Company fails to 36
deliver a Non-Cure Notice within the applicable 10-Business Day period or (c) within 45 Business Days of Parent's delivery of a notice of title objections the Company has not removed or cured the noticed title objections, Parent shall have the right, exercisable within 10 Business Day from such event, either (i) to elect to accept the title to the Property subject to the title objections specified by Parent (in which event such title objections shall be deemed for all purposes herein, "Company Permitted Encumbrances") without any reduction or abatement of the Merger Consideration or (ii) to elect to terminate this Agreement. Failure of Parent to notify the Company of its election within the applicable 10-Business Day period shall be deemed to constitute Parent's election to accept such title objections, which title objections will then be deemed for all purposes herein as "Company Permitted Encumbrances." (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in clause (a) above, (i) The Company shall not be obligated to pay the cost of any policy of title insurance and of any survey relating to the Property; (ii) Unpaid Liens for taxes, water charges and assessments which Subsidiary is obligated to pay and discharge shall not be deemed an Encumbrance, Property Restriction or other defect of title which is not a Permitted Company Encumbrance; (iii) If, on the Closing Date, there shall be financing statements which were filed more than five years prior to the Closing Date and which were not continued, such financing statements shall not be deemed an Encumbrance, Property Restriction or other defect of title which is not a Permitted Company Encumbrance, provided that (i) the Title Insurer shall afford Subsidiary affirmative coverage against any loss or damage (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation) resulting from the enforcement or attempted enforcement of the security interest evidenced by such financing statement(s) or (ii) each such financing statement is omitted as an exception from the title insurance coverage afforded to Subsidiary by the Title Insurer; (iv) In the event there are unpaid state franchise Taxes and/or municipal corporate business Taxes due from any Persons in the chain of title, which franchise taxes and/or municipal business Taxes are or may be a Lien upon the Property, such Taxes shall not be deemed an Encumbrance, Property Restriction or other defect of title which is not a Permitted Company Encumbrance, provided that either (x) such Taxes reduce the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or (y) the Title Insurer (i) shall afford Subsidiary affirmative coverage against any loss or damage (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation) resulting from the enforcement or attempted enforcement of any such execution or Lien or (ii) shall otherwise insure Subsidiary against collection of such taxes out of the Property.

All payments made pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall be made by wire transfer of the same day funds to an account designated by Parent. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, any payments otherwise to be made by the Company to Parent under Sections 7.2(b) and (c) hereof for any calendar year shall not exceed the sum of (a) the amount that it is determined should not be gross income of Parent for purposes of the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, with such determination to be set forth in an opinion of outside tax counsel selected by Parent, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which opinion is referred to as a "NO GROSS INCOME OPINION") plus (b) such additional amount that it is estimated can be paid to Parent in such taxable year without creating a risk that the payment would cause Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income that qualifies as gross income for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code, which determination shall be made by independent tax accountants to Parent and (c) in the event Parent receives a letter from tax counsel (the "ALTERNATIVE TAX 41
LETTER") indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service holding that Parent's receipt of the additional amount otherwise to be paid under this Agreement either would constitute income that qualifies as gross income for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code ("QUALIFYING INCOME") or would be excluded from gross income of Parent for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT REQUIREMENTS"), the aggregate payments otherwise required to be made under this Agreement (determined without regard to this Section 7.2(d)) less the amount otherwise previously paid under clauses (a) and (b) above.

At the end of the three-year period referred to above in this Section 7.2(d) with respect to any amount placed in such escrow, if none of the events referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the preceding sentence shall have occurred, such amount shall be released from such escrow to be used as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. SECTION 7.3 EXPENSES. Except as set forth in Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(c) or to the extent included in Company Merger Expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION By: /s/ Milton Cooper --------------------------------- Name: Milton Cooper Title: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer SI 1339, INC. By: /s/ Milton Cooper --------------------------------- Name: Milton Cooper Title: Chief Executive Officer ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST By: /s/ Edwin Frankel --------------------------------- Name: Edwin Frankel Title: Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer

EXHIBIT 99.2 Filed by Kimco Realty Corporation Pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425(a) under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended Subject Company: Atlantic Realty Trust Commission File No. 001-11455 Date: December 1, 2005 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST ANNOUNCE MERGER AGREEMENT New Hyde Park, NY & New York, NY, December 1, 2005 Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) and Atlantic Realty Trust (NASDAQ: ATLRS) today announced that the two companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Kimco will acquire Atlantic Realty for $82.5 million plus the amount of Atlantic Realty's cash on hand at closing and certain agreed upon lease expenses less merger expenses and other liabilities, including certain liabilities under Atlantic Realty's tax agreement with Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust. On the last business day prior to closing Atlantic Realty will declare a dividend in an amount necessary for Atlantic Realty to qualify as a REIT. The merger consideration will be paid in shares of Kimco common stock valued on the final full trading day immediately preceding the closing. Atlantic Realty currently estimates that as of today it has cash on hand and has incurred approved lease expenses of $9,667,000 and anticipates that it will have merger expenses and other liabilities for which it is responsible of at least $10,434,000. These amounts do not take into account the impact of future dividends, property cash flow or additional liabilities that may be incurred between now and the closing of the merger, none of which can be predicted with certainty. As a result, the exact merger consideration will not be finally determined until immediately prior to the closing. The merger is subject to approval by Atlantic Realty shareholders and to customary closing conditions. ABOUT KIMCO Kimco, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for over 45 years.
