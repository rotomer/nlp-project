On a per share basis, net income increased 40.6 percent to $0.45 from $0.32 reported for the fourth quarter last year. Funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, rose 23.0 percent to $127.5 million during the quarter from $103.6 million for the same period last year. On a per share basis, fourth quarter FFO increased 22.2 percent to $0.55 from $0.45 a year ago. Funds from operations excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties net of minority interests and joint venture properties of approximately $19.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share in 2005 and $4.5 million, or approximately $0.02 per share in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net income was $363.6 million or $1.52 per share compared to $297.1 million, or $1.26 per share a year earlier. Funds from operations rose 14.6 percent to $464.7 million from $405.3 million in the year earlier period. On a diluted per common share basis, FFO increased 13.0 percent to $2.00 from $1.77 a year ago. Funds from operations for the current year excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties net of minority interests and joint venture properties of $45.4 million or approximately $0.19 per diluted common share and $19.4 million or approximately $0.08 per diluted common share for the same period last year. These operating results are consistent with the Company's objective of generating a high level of income and FFO growth over time. Kimco's compound annual growth rate in FFO per share is 10.7 percent in the 14 year period since its initial public offering in 1991. Funds from operations (FFO) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO is included in this release. During the quarter, Kimco's parent portfolio occupancy increased to 94.6 percent from 94.2 percent at September 30, 2005 and 93.6 percent a year earlier. Kimco's occupancy is the highest level in Company history. For the quarter, Kimco signed 139 new leases in the portfolio totaling 936,000 square feet and 85 lease renewals totaling 462,000 square feet. Year to date the Company has signed 474 new leases in this portfolio totaling approximately 2.8 million square feet and 339 lease renewals totaling 2.2 million square feet. The average increase in base rent for new leases signed for same space leases was 18.7 percent and 12.2 percent for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. Occupancy in the Company's combined operating portfolio encompassing approximately 109.5 million square feet of gross leasable area was 95.1 percent, 40 basis points higher than a year ago.

A summary of the transactions in the fourth quarter is as follows: - Kimco acquired interests in 23 U.S. retail properties totaling 1.6 million square feet of gross leasable area.

Kimco Realty Corporation is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that has specialized in shopping center acquisitions, development and management for more than 45 years.

Kimco Realty Corporation Consolidated Statements of Income (In thousands, except per share data)
Note: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation. (1) Included in the calculation of income from continuing operations per share in accordance with SEC guidelines. (2) The potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Net income would be increased by $1,739 for the three months ended December 31, 2005. (3) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. The impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included.
Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) (1) Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $1,739 and $1,607 for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $6,693 and $6,113 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.
