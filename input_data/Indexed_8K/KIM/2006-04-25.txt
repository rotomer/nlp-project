On a diluted per common share basis, net income increased 11.1 percent to $0.40 from $0.36 in the first quarter of 2005. Kimco's first quarter funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, rose 14.8 percent to $124.6 million from $108.5 million for the same period last year. On a diluted per common share basis, first quarter FFO increased 12.8 percent to $0.53 from $0.47 a year ago. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. A complete reconciliation containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO is included in this release. Kimco's parent portfolio occupancy remained high at 94.6 percent, consistent with the prior quarter's level and 1.2 percent higher than a year ago. For the quarter, Kimco signed 110 new leases in this portfolio totaling 434,000 square feet. Forty-eight of these new leases were for spaces where the company replaced a prior tenant from a year ago. The average increase in contractual base rent on these same space leases was approximately 16.2 percent on a cash basis. The Company also signed 108 tenant lease renewals, and option exercises totaling 556,000 square feet resulting in average cash rent increases of 10.5 percent. Over the past four quarters, Kimco has signed 184 same space new leases totaling 872,000 square feet at an average cash increase of approximately 14.1 percent and 342 lease renewals and options totaling 1.8 million square feet at an average cash increase of approximately 9.5 percent. As a result of these strong leasing results and the Company's ongoing redevelopment program, Kimco's same store growth in net operating income was 5.5 percent, on a cash basis and excluding lease termination fees. Investment Activity During the first quarter Kimco acquired interests in 110 properties valued at approximately $1.1 billion and aggregating 7.9 million square feet. From year-end through the date of this release, Kimco has acquired interests in 120 properties valued at $1.3 billion and aggregating approximately 9.2 million square feet. Many of the properties acquired represent co-investments with institutional partners. The Company continues to aggressively grow its assets under management and corresponding management fee revenue. A summary of the recent major transactions is as follows:
U.S. Acquisitions -- The Company acquired a portfolio of 19 shopping centers located in California, Nevada and Hawaii for approximately $134 million. In aggregate, the properties total 1.7 million square feet of gross leasable area, including anchor owned space of approximately 885,000 square feet. -- The Company acquired Copperwood Village, a 350,000 square foot shopping center located in Houston, Texas, for approximately $73.9 million. Anchor tenants at the property include Michael's, OfficeMax, Marshall's and Bed Bath & Beyond. This property was acquired for the Company's co-investment program with UBS Wealth Management. -- The Company acquired Cupertino Village, a 115,000 square foot neighborhood and community shopping center located in a densely populated submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area. The property has excellent demographics, with 220,000 people located within a three mile radius and average household incomes of $115,000. Kimco acquired this property at a cost of approximately $65.4 million. -- As previously announced, the Company acquired interests in two shopping centers located in Puerto Rico; Plaza Central in Caguas and Los Colobos in Carolina. In aggregate, these two property interests were purchased for approximately $186 million. Kimco is under contract to acquire interests in five additional shopping centers in Puerto Rico later this year. -- In a transaction consistent with Kimco's strategy of acquiring high quality properties for its co-investment programs, the Company acquired a minority interest in a portfolio of six shopping centers with a total value of $385.6 million. The 1.8 million square foot portfolio consists of properties located in Edgewater, New Jersey; Ellicott City, Maryland; Austin, Texas; Clackamas, Oregon; West Lake Hills, Texas; and Palm Aire, Florida. These properties are well positioned in dense, in-fill markets with high barriers to new competition. Kimco is acquiring its interest from Crow Holdings Fund III, a prominent institutional real estate investment fund that will remain the majority investor in these properties. Kimco will provide property management services for the portfolio. -- The Company acquired Hylan Plaza shopping center located in Staten Island, New York, as a result of its recently completed acquisition of Atlantic Realty Trust. Hylan Plaza, which was valued at approximately $82 million, is a 358,155 square foot shopping center anchored by Kmart, Pathmark and Toys R' Us. Most of the tenants at this shopping center have leases with below market rent and short remaining lease terms, which will allow Kimco to grow rental income from the property substantially. -- The Company acquired two shopping centers on Long Island in Centereach and Bay Shore, New York. The properties, which total 279,000 square feet were acquired in separate transactions for a total of $61.6 million. -- The Company acquired Tyler Street Plaza, an 86,108 square foot shopping center, located in Riverside, California, for approximately $10.1 million. This property will be transferred later this year to one of Kimco's co-investment programs.
-- In addition, the Company acquired interests in seven other retail locations and increased its ownership interests in two properties already in the Company's portfolio. In aggregate, these transactions totaled $21.6 million. Mexico Investments In Mexico, during the quarter Kimco acquired a 13 acre site in Monterrey, Mexico, for development of a 312,000 square foot HEB anchored shopping center. The Company's initial investment to acquire the land was approximately $12.8 million and the total project cost is expected to be approximately $35.6 million. Also during the quarter, Kimco's venture with American Industries acquired interests in two additional net leased properties for an aggregate gross cost of $4.7 million. In addition, the venture expanded three buildings for existing tenants for a gross investment of $12.2 million. The venture currently owns 59 net leased properties totaling 6.0 million square feet that are 97.2 percent occupied. Subsequent to quarter end, Kimco acquired a 20 acre site in Guadalajara, Mexico for the ground up development of a 767,400 square foot shopping center. The property is located in a highly sought after in-fill location in Mexico's second largest city where there is strong demand from anchor tenants. Kimco has initially invested $31.6 million and the total project cost is expected to be approximately $83 million upon completion. Canadian Investments The Company had a very strong quarter expanding its investments in Canada. Kimco recently completed seven transactions, investing approximately $71 million and acquiring interests in 30 properties. A summary of the transactions is as follows: -- Kimco invested $24.0 million in a joint venture for an eight property portfolio in Canada located in Montreal; Ottawa (2); Toronto; Windsor (3) and Winnipeg. -- Kimco invested $20.8 million in a preferred equity transaction to acquire a portfolio of 15 properties in Montreal, Quebec. In aggregate, the properties total 848,000 square feet of gross leasable area. -- Kimco invested $9.7 million in the Centre Village Mall, a 368,418 square foot grocery anchored shopping center located in Lethbridge, Alberta. -- Kimco invested $16.3 million in six additional Canadian properties in separate transactions as follows: * A $7.2 million investment in The Village, a 474,644 shopping center in St. John's, Newfoundland. * A $3.9 million investment in a ground up development project for Real Canadian Superstore, a division of Loblaws, the dominant grocer in Canada. * A $3.0 million investment in a portfolio of three grocery anchored neighborhood shopping centers located in La Malbai, St-Augustin-de-Desmaures and Laurier Station, Quebec. * A $2.2 million investment in an 86,000 square foot building located in Toronto.
U.S. Preferred Equity Investments Kimco continues to grow its preferred equity program in the U.S. Since year end, the Company has made the following investments: -- Kimco acquired a preferred equity interest in two buildings located in Manhattan at 625 Broadway and 387 Bleecker Street. In aggregate, these properties were valued at $40.3 million. -- The Company invested $17.8 million in a portfolio of 28 neighborhood retail properties. The properties are located across 11 states and total 684,860 square feet. -- In Florida, the Company acquired preferred equity interests in a portfolio of three shopping centers for an aggregate investment of $12.6 million. -- Kimco also funded approximately $13.6 million of preferred equity in seven additional properties in the U.S. During the quarter, three preferred equity investments were redeemed for proceeds in the amount of $14.1 million, resulting in profit participation of $4.3 million. Since the inception of Kimco's preferred equity program, approximately $55 million has been redeemed resulting in profit participation of approximately $22.5 million. In aggregate, Kimco's preferred equity portfolio has grown to a total of 195 properties totaling 14.1 million square feet of gross leasable area. Kimco currently has preferred equity investments throughout the U.S. and Canada of approximately $310 million. Development Activities Kimco Developers Inc.

Kimco also invested $39.6 million to acquire interests in four new development projects located in Dallas, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. With the addition of these new projects, Kimco currently has 41 active development projects in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, with a total estimated project cost of approximately $1.5 billion. When completed, the developments will encompass more than 15.1 million square feet of leasable area. Kimco also owns 250 acres of land, primarily in Arizona, that is being held for future development. In addition, Kimco is currently evaluating 16 additional developments in the U.S. totaling approximately $1.0 billion and ten potential developments in Mexico totaling $250 million and one large project in Canada totaling C$216 million. Dispositions Activity During the quarter Kimco sold interests in 12 retail properties for a total of $77.2 million.

Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, --------------------------- 2006 2005 ---------- ---------- Funds From Operations Net income $ 96,195 $ 86,780 Gain on disposition of operating properties, net of minority interests (11,626) (3,991) Gain on disposition of joint venture operating properties (1,732) (8,288) Depreciation and amortization 29,677 26,183 Depreciation and amortization -- real estate joint ventures, net of minority interests 15,009 10,760 Preferred stock dividends (2,909) (2,909) ---------- ---------- Funds from operations $ 124,614 $ 108,535 ========== ========== Per common share: -- Basic $ 0.54 $ 0.48 ========== ========== -- Diluted(3) $ 0.53(3) $ 0.47(3) ========== ========== Weighted Average Share Information for FFO Calculations Weighted average shares: -- Basic 228,674 225,461 ========== ========== -- Diluted(3) 238,386(3) 234,311(3) ========== ========== (3) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $1,739 and $1,607 for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. NOTE: Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items.
