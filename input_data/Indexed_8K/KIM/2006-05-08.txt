ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS During March 2006, Kimco Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") acquired interests in two shopping center properties located in Caguas and Carolina, Puerto Rico, comprising an aggregate of approximately 0.8 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), valued at an aggregate $185.9 million. The properties were acquired through the issuance of redeemable units from a consolidated subsidiary and consist of approximately $84.4 million of floating and fixed-rate redeemable units, approximately $29.1 million of redeemable units, which are redeemable at the option of the holder and approximately $72.4 million in cash. Additionally during March 2006, the Company committed to acquire interests in five additional shopping center properties located in Puerto Rico, comprising an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million square feet of GLA, with an aggregate value of approximately $262.3 million. Consideration for these additional acquisitions will consist of approximately $41.5 million of cash, the issuance of approximately $72.0 million of floating and fixed-rate redeemable units, the issuance of approximately $16.7 million of redeemable units, which are redeemable at the option of the holder and the assumption of approximately $132.1 million of non-recourse mortgage debt. The additional acquisitions are scheduled to close the earlier of the completion of the mortgage assumptions or December 1, 2006. These property transactions (the "Puerto Rico Portfolio") are with unrelated third parties and represent individually insignificant acquisitions. Details of the Puerto Rico Portfolio acquisition are as follows (in thousands): (1) Includes properties acquired during March 2006. (2) Assumed mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.48% to 8.17% and maturities ranging from September 2007 to March 2014.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kimco Realty Corporation: We have audited the accompanying Combined Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain Expenses (the "Historical Summary") of the Puerto Rico Portfolio (the "Portfolio") for the year ended December 31, 2005. This Historical Summary is the responsibility of the Portfolio's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Historical Summary based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The accompanying Historical Summary was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the Form 8-K of Kimco Realty Corporation) as described in Note 1 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Portfolio's revenues and expenses. In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses described in Note 1 of the Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

During March 2006, Kimco Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") acquired interests in two shopping center properties located in Caguas and Carolina, Puerto Rico, comprising an aggregate of approximately 0.8 million square feet of gross leasable area "GLA", for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $185.9 million. Additionally during March 2006, the Company committed to acquire five additional shopping center properties located in Puerto Rico, comprising an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million square feet of GLA, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $262.1 million.

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and for inclusion in the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company. The Historical Summary is not intended to be a complete presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Portfolio as certain expenses, primarily depreciation and amortization, interest, property management fees and other costs not directly related to the future operations of the Portfolio, have been excluded. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE RECOGNITION Base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses represent the direct expenses of operating the Portfolio and include maintenance, utilities and repair costs that are expected to continue in the ongoing operations of the Portfolio. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the Historical Summary in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and certain expenses during the reporting period, to disclose contingent 8

Actual results may differ from those estimates. 3. COMMITMENTS The Puerto Rico Portfolio leases premises to tenants pursuant to lease agreements, which provide for terms ranging from two to 35 years. The future minimum revenues from rental property under the terms of all-non-cancellable tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases are executed for such premises, for the future years are approximately as follows (in thousands): 2006 $ 31,032 2007 30,231 2008 29,291 2009 27,472 2010 24,733 Thereafter 170,124 -------- Total $312,883 ======== 9

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, has been prepared to reflect the effect of the Puerto Rico Portfolio acquisition by the Company, as if such transaction had occurred on January 1, 2005. These unaudited pro forma consolidated statements should be read in connection with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the opinion of management, the pro forma consolidated financial information provides for all adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the above transactions. The pro forma information is unaudited and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results that would have occurred if the transactions and adjustments reflected therein had been consummated in the period or on the date presented, or on any particular date in the future, nor does it purport to represent the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for future periods.
