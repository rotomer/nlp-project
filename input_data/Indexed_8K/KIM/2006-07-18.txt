Morgan Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (each, an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") confirms the agreement between the Company and the Agents with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Series C Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue (the "Notes"). This Agreement amends and restates the Distribution Agreement, dated September 26, 2001, as amended and supplemented by the First Amendment to the Distribution Agreement, dated July 28, 2003 (as amended, the "Original Distribution Agreement") between the Company and the Agents with respect to the issue and sale by the Company's Notes. The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 1, 1993, as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, including the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of August 4, 1994, the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of April 7, 1995, and the Third Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of June 2, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the 1939 Act.
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent), in which case such Agent will act as an agent of the Company in soliciting purchases of the Notes. Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Notes through you or through an underwriting syndicate managed by you, the Company will enter into an agreement, substantially in the form set forth as Exhibit A hereto, (the "Terms Agreement") setting forth the terms of offer and sale of such Notes of a particular tranche. The Company has filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-133908) which provides for the registration of securities (including the Notes) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may have been required as of the date hereof. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable), including any document incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering the Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit, and any prospectus, prospectus supplement and/or pricing supplement deemed or retroactively deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement." "Registration Statement" without reference to a time means the Registration Statement as of the time of the first contract of sale of any tranche of Notes, which time shall be considered the "effective date" of the Registration Statement with respect to such Notes. For purposes of the definition of Registration Statement as used herein, information contained in a form of prospectus, prospectus supplement or pricing supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 430B") shall be considered to be included in the Registration Statement at the time specified in Rule 430B. The prospectus supplement relating to the series of Notes and the base prospectus and all applicable amendments or supplements thereto, in each case immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below), including any document incorporated by reference therein, shall collectively be referred to herein as the "Statutory Prospectus." The "Prospectus" means, collectively, the Statutory Prospectus and the final pricing supplement in the form first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 424(b)") that discloses the public offering price and other final terms of the Notes of any issue and otherwise satisfies Section 10(a) of the 1933 Act. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus and any prospectus supplement used before the acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes which omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Statutory Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). 2
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "disclosed," "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Statutory Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, Statutory Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Statutory Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, Statutory Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be. SECTION 1. Appointment as Agent. (a) Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby agrees that Notes will be sold to or through the Agents. The Company agrees that it will not appoint any other agents to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Notes. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to appoint additional agents for the offer and sale of Notes, which agency may be on an on-going basis or on a one-time basis. Any such additional agent shall become a party to this Agreement and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions hereof and entitled to the benefits hereunder upon the execution of a counterpart hereof or other form of acknowledgement of its appointment hereunder. (b) Sale of Notes. The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time. The Agents shall have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate initial offering price of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement. (c) Purchases as Principal. The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but one or more Agents may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers determined by such Agent or Agents. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof. 3
(d) Solicitations as Agent. If agreed upon by an Agent and the Company, such Agent, acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal, will solicit purchases of the Notes. Such Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer to purchase Notes solicited by it on an agency basis, other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Such Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of Notes, in whole or in part. Such Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by it and accepted by the Company. Such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event that any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would otherwise be entitled. (e) Reliance. The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes purchased from the Company by one or more Agents as principal shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges as an agent of the Company shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein. SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties. (a) The Company represents and warrants to the Agents as of the date hereof, as of the date of each delivery of Notes (whether to one or more Agents as principal or through an Agent as agent) (the date of each such delivery to one or more Agents as principal is referred to herein as a "Settlement Date"), and as of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein), as of the date of any supplement to the Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time (each of the times referenced above is referred to herein as a "Representation Date"), and agrees with each Agent as follows: (i) Registration Statement and Prospectus.

The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, and the Notes, since their registration on the Registration Statement, have been and remain eligible for registration by the Company on a Rule 405 "automatic shelf registration statement." The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. 4

The Company has filed such post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement as may have been required prior to the Company's acceptance of an offer to purchase the Notes.

(b) Additional Certifications. Any certificate signed by any director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and delivered to one or more Agents or to counsel for the Agents in connection with an offering of Notes to one or more Agents as principal or through an Agent as agent shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to such Agent or Agents as to the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate and, unless subsequently amended or supplemented, at each Representation Date subsequent thereto. SECTION 3. Purchases as Principal; Solicitations as Agent. (a) Purchases as Principal. Unless otherwise agreed to in the applicable Terms Agreement, Notes shall be purchased by the Agents, individually or in a syndicate as principal. Such purchases shall be made in accordance with terms agreed upon by one or more Agents and the Company (which terms, unless otherwise agreed, shall, to the extent applicable, include those terms specified in Exhibit A hereto and be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by such Agent or Agents and mailed to the Company). An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include the agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal. Each purchase of Notes, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable Terms Agreement, shall be at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Schedule A hereto. The Agents may engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the resale of the Notes purchased by them as principal and may allow all or any portion of the discount received in connection with such purchases from the Company to such brokers and dealers. At the time of each purchase of Notes from the Company by one or more Agents as principal, such Agent or Agents shall specify the requirements for the stand-off agreement, officers' certificate, opinions of counsel and comfort letter pursuant to Sections 4(j), 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) hereof. If the Company and two or more Agents enter into a Terms Agreement pursuant to which such Agents agree to purchase Notes from the Company as principal and one or more of such Agents shall fail at the Settlement Date to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase (the "Defaulted Notes"), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents or underwriters, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; provided, however, that if such arrangement shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period, then: (i) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial underwriting obligations bear to the underwriting obligations of all nondefaulting Agents; or 14
(ii) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, such agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent. No action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of such agreements, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Settlement Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. (b) Solicitations as Agent. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, when agreed by the Company and an Agent in the applicable Terms Agreement, such Agent, as an agent of the Company, will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers for the purchase of Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Prospectus. The Agents are not authorized to appoint sub-agents with respect to Notes sold through them as agent. All Notes sold through an Agent as agent will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and such Agent. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes through an Agent, as an agent of the Company, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. As soon as practicable after receipt of instructions from the Company, such Agent will suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent that such solicitation may be resumed. The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, in the form of a discount, equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of each Note sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, as an agent of the Company, as set forth in Schedule A hereto unless otherwise agreed in the applicable Terms Agreement. (c) Administrative Procedures. The purchase price, interest rate or formula, maturity date and other terms of the Notes (as applicable), as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, shall be agreed upon by the Company and the applicable Agent or Agents and specified in a pricing supplement to the Prospectus (each, a "Pricing Supplement") to be prepared by the Company in connection with each sale of Notes. Except as may be otherwise specified in the applicable Terms Agreement and the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes will be issued in denominations of U.S. $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000. Administrative procedures with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Company, the Agents and the Trustee (the "Procedures"). The Agents and the Company agree to perform, and the Company agrees to cause the Trustee to agree to perform, their respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures. 15
SECTION 4. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with the Agents as follows: (a) The Company will file each Statutory Prospectus pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed therein. Prior to the termination of the offering of any tranche of Notes, the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or Statutory Prospectus (except for a supplement relating to an offering of securities other than the Notes) unless the Company has furnished to the related Agent(s) a copy for their review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which such Agent(s) may reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause each supplement to the Prospectus or Statutory Prospectus to be filed with the Commission as required pursuant to Rule 424 (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8) of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 424(b)(8)")). The Company will promptly advise such Agent(s) (i) when each supplement to the Prospectus or Statutory Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (the filing of any such supplement on EDGAR shall be deemed notice by the Company to the Agents), (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have become effective (for so long as the Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" within the meaning of Rule 405, the filing of any such amendment on EDGAR shall be deemed notice of effectiveness by the Company to the Agents), (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or amendment to or supplement to the Prospectus or Statutory Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the 1933 Act with respect to the Registration Statement, (v) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Notes, (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (vii) any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof as soon as reasonably possible. The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) of the 1933 Act Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the 1933 Act Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) of the 1933 Act Regulations either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)). 16
(b) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, that initially became effective within three years of the date hereof. If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, any of the Notes remain unsold by the Agent(s), the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Agents. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Agents, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other reasonable action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Notes. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be. (c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be (or, but for the exemption in Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, would be required to be) delivered under the 1933 Act, any event occurs as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as then supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any facts or events arise which, individually or in the aggregate, would represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or to supplement the Prospectus to comply with the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify such Agent to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes (and, if so notified, such Agent shall forthwith suspend such solicitation and cease using the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented), (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance and (iii) will supply any such amended or supplemented Prospectus or new registration statement to such Agent in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request. If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, certificates and opinions furnished to such Agent pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Section 4 in connection with the preparation or filing of such amendment or supplement are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to such Agent, such Agent will, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission and upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement (or new registration statement) if such an amendment is required, resume such Agent's obligation to solicit offers to purchase Notes hereunder. If, prior to the completion of the public offer and sale of the Notes (as communicated to the Company by the Agents), at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information then contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Notes) or Prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly (i) notify the applicable Agent(s) and (ii) amend or supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission. 17
(d) With respect to any issue of Notes, the Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the related Agent(s), it will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, that is required to be filed with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433; provided that the prior written consent of the Agent(s) hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect to the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es) listed in the applicable Terms Agreement. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by such Agent(s) is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated and agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely Commission filing where required, legending and record keeping. (e) The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") relating to the final terms of the Notes, in the form attached to the form of Terms Agreement, and will file such Final Term Sheet within the period required by Rule 433(d)(5)(ii). Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, the Agent may, without consent of the Company, use a free writing prospectus (including customary Bloomberg emails containing pricing terms) that contains substantially only (a) (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering, (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Notes or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in the first sentence of this subsection or (iii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the 1933 Act or (b) other information that is not "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433. (f) The Company will deliver to the Agents as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as the Agents reasonably request. The Company will furnish to the Agents as many copies of the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (in each case, as amended or supplemented) as the Agents reasonably request so long as the Agents are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes. (g) As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 16 months after any Settlement Date, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Agents an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement and otherwise satisfying the provisions of and provide the benefits contemplated by Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 under the 1933 Act. 18
(h) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Agents may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. (i) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Notes, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act within the time periods prescribed by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (j) If specified by the applicable Agent or Agents in connection with a purchase of Notes from the Company as principal, between the date of the agreement to purchase such Notes and the Settlement Date with respect to such purchase, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of such Agent or Agents, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company (other than the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement, commercial paper in the ordinary course of business or assumptions of mortgages on acquired properties). (k) The Company will continue to elect to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code and will use its best efforts to continue to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" for so long as the Company's board of directors deems it in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to remain so qualified. (l) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the issuance and sale of the Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus. SECTION 5. Conditions of Agents' Obligations. The obligations of the Agents to purchase Notes as principal and to solicit offers to purchase the Notes as agent of the Company, and the obligations of any purchasers of the Notes sold through an Agent as agent, will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein and to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance and observance by the Company of all its covenants and agreements herein contained and to the following additional conditions precedent: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement. At the Settlement Date, (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings therefor have been initiated or threatened by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of counsel to the Agents, (ii) each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus containing the Rule 430B Information shall have been filed with the Commission in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8) (or a post-effective amendment providing such information shall have been filed and become effective in accordance with the requirements of Rule 430B), (iii) the Final Term Sheet and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings under such Rule 433, (iv) the Company shall have paid the required Commission filing fees relating to Notes of a particular tranche within the time period required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) of the 1933 Act Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the 1933 Act Regulations and, if applicable, shall have updated the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), (v) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement shall not have been lowered or withdrawn since such date nor shall any such rating organization have publicly announced that it has any debt securities of the Company under surveillance or review and (vi) there shall not have come to your attention any facts that would cause you to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered or made available to purchasers of Notes of a particular tranche, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at such time, not misleading. 19
(b) Legal Opinions. On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received the following legal opinions, dated as of the date hereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents: (1) Opinion of Company Counsel. The favorable opinion of Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel to the Company, to the effect that: (i) The Indenture is the valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. (ii) The Notes, when executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Agents in accordance with the terms of the applicable Terms Agreement, will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms. (iii) The statements in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of Notes," insofar as they purport to describe or summarize certain provisions of the Notes or the Indenture, are accurate descriptions or summaries in all material respects. (iv) The Indenture has been qualified under the 1939 Act. 20
(v) The Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act; any required filing of the Statutory Prospectus and the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes of a particular tranche, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (assuming the date it is "first used" within the meaning of Rule 424(b) is the date of the pricing of the Notes). With the consent from the Agents and their counsel, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, based solely on telephonic advice from the Commission, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings therefore have been initiated by the Commission.

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Agent), as incurred, which was reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above. provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any preliminary prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or made in reliance upon the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. (b) Indemnification of Company. Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use therein. (c) Actions Against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.

In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. 31
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. SECTION 9. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the Agents, as incurred, in such proportions that each applicable Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the commission or underwriting discount received by such Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of the Notes sold to or through such Agent that were the subject of the claim for indemnification, and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (i) no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount or commission received by such Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (2) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. 32

This Agreement (excluding any agreement hereunder by one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal) may be terminated for any reason, at any time by either the Company or an Agent, as to itself, upon the giving of 10 days' prior written notice of such termination to the other party hereto. (b) Termination of Agreement to Purchase Notes as Principal. The applicable Agent or Agents may terminate any agreement hereunder by such Agent or Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if (i) there has been, since the date of such agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or if such Notes are denominated and/or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other national or international calamity or crisis, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of such Agent or Agents, impracticable to market such Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of such Notes, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign or composite currency or currencies in which the Notes are denominated or payable, or (v) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to the Program or any debt securities (including the Notes) of the Company as of the date of such agreement shall have been lowered or withdrawn since that date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Program or any such debt securities of the Company, or (vi) there shall have come to the attention of such Agent or Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of such Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. (c) General. In the event of any such termination, neither party will have any liability to the other party hereto, except that (i) the Agents shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 3(b) hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (a) any Agent shall own any Notes purchased by it from the Company as principal with the intention of reselling them or (b) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 7 hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 4(j) hereof, the provisions of Section 10 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11, 16 and 17 hereof shall remain in effect. 34
