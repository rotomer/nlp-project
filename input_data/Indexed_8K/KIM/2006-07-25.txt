During the quarter, Kimco's parent portfolio occupancy increased to 94.8 percent from 94.6 percent at March 31, 2006 and 94.1 percent a year earlier.

Over the past 12 months the Company has signed 497 new leases in this portfolio totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet and 362 renewals totaling 1.9 million square feet.

Kimco Realty Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (In thousands, except per share data)
Note: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation. (1) Included in the calculation of income from continuing operations per share in accordance with SEC guidelines. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Net income would be increased by $209 for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and $363 for the six months ended June 30, 2006. (3) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. The impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore has not been included.
Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) (1) Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization and gains on sales of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $2,103 and $1,607 for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $3,842 and $3,215 for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Kimco Realty Corporation Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (In thousands, except share data) Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation.
