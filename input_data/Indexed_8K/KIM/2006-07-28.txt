Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Executive Summary
Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of February 6, 2006, the Company had interests in 1,046 properties totaling approximately 135.5 million square feet of GLA located in 44 states, Canada and Mexico.
The Company is self-administered and self-managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company.
In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate-related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI") subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise.
In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management's judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate.
The Company's strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2005 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.33 from $0.305, effective for the fourth quarter of 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives and valuation of real estate. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
     
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.
The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.
     
Real Estate
The Company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life.
Back to Contents
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income.
Real estate under development on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion. These assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in management's opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales.
     
Long Lived Assets
On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances.

Results of Operations
     
Comparison 2005 to 2004
Revenues from rental property increased $14.7 million or 2.9% to $519.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $504.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2005 and 2004 providing incremental revenues of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 94.6% at December 31, 2005, as compared to 93.6% at December 31, 2004 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding periods last year, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period last year, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2005 and 2004.
Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $13.8 million or 6.0% to $242.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $228.3 million for the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2005 and 2004, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities.
Mortgage and other financing income increased $12.6 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase primarily relates to a $14.0 million prepayment fee received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company.
Management and other fee income increased approximately $5.0 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $25.4 million in the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co-investment programs.
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $12.4 million to $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $44.1 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, due in part to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) a $3.0 million increase due to the expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted, and (iii) increased personnel and systems related costs associated with the growth of the Company.
Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $9.6 million to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $18.7 million in 2004. This increase is primarily due to greater dividend income and realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities during 2005 as compared to the preceding year.
Interest expense increased $20.4 million to $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2005.
Income from other real estate investments increased $27.3 million to $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $30.1 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Company's Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $32.8 million during 2005, including an aggregate of approximately $12.6 million of promoted interests earned from six capital transactions during 2005, as compared to $11.4 million in 2004.
Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $21.1 million to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $56.4 million for the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) the increased equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment ("KIR") resulting from the sale of two operating properties during 2005 which provided an aggregate gain of $20.2 million, of which the pro-rata share to the Company was $8.7 million, (ii) increased equity in income in three joint venture investments resulting from the sale of two operating properties and one development property during 2005, which provided aggregate gains of approximately $17.9 million, of which the pro-rata share to the Company was approximately $8.8 million, and (iii) the Company's growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004.

During 2005, KDI, the Company's wholly-owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold six recently completed projects and 41 out-parcels for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, net of income taxes of approximately $10.8 million.
During 2004, KDI, the Company's wholly-owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold five recently completed projects, three completed phases of projects and 28 out-parcels for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, net of income taxes of approximately $4.4 million.
During 2005, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company disposed of 13 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $121.9 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $29.2 million, net of income taxes of $2.2 million relating to the sale of one property, and transferred five operating properties to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million.
During the three months ended March 31, 2006, the Company classified as held-for-sale six shopping centers comprising approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA. The book value of each of these properties, aggregating approximately $24.3 million, did not exceed each of their estimated fair values. As a result, no adjustment of property carrying value has been recorded. The Company's determination of the fair value for each of these properties, aggregating approximately $29.5 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. The Company completed the sale of all of these properties during the three months ended June 30, 2006.
During the three months ended June 30, 2006, the Company classified as held-for-sale two shopping center properties comprising approximately 0.3 million square feet of GLA. The book value of each of these properties, aggregating approximately $2.5 million, did not exceed each of their estimated fair values. As a result, no adjustment of property carrying value has been recorded. The Company's determination of the fair value for each of these properties, aggregating approximately $8.1 million, is based upon primarily executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs.
The current and prior comparative years operations of properties classified as held-for-sale as of June 30, 2006 are included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co-investment ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million.

As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144") is applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $363.6 million, compared to $297.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.26 to $1.52 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $1.26 for the previous year. This increase is attributable to (i) increased income from other real estate investments, primarily from the Company's Preferred Equity program, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from gains on sales of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Company's joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004, (iii) increased income contributed from mortgage and other financing receivables as compared to last year and (iv) increased gains on sale/transfer of development and operating properties during 2005, as compared to the same period during 2004.
     
Comparison 2004 to 2003
Revenues from rental property increased $40.9 million or 8.8% to $504.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $463.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2004 and 2003 providing incremental revenues of $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 93.6% at December 31, 2004, as compared to 90.7% at December 31, 2003 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding periods last year, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding period last year, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2004 and 2003.
Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $26.4 million or 13.1% to $228.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $201.9 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2004 and 2003, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities.

Mortgage and other financing income decreased $3.8 million to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest and financing income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during 2004 as compared to the preceding year.
Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.1 million to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $15.3 million in the corresponding period in 2003. This increase was primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co-investment programs and fees earned from disposition services provided to various retailers.
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $5.9 million to $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $38.2 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $0.9 million increase in professional fees, mainly attributable to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) a $1.6 million increase due to the expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted, (iii) increased staff levels related to the growth of the Company and (iv) other personnel-related costs, associated with a realignment of our regional operations.
Other income/(expense), net increased approximately $14.2 million to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to a prior-year write-down in the carrying value of the Company's equity investment in Frank's Nursery, Inc., offset by increased income in 2004 from other equity investments.
Interest expense increased $4.8 million to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2004.
During 2003, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with three individual non-recourse mortgages encumbering three former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $14.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans, which aggregated approximately $24.0 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $9.7 million during 2003.
Income from other real estate investments increased $7.3 million to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $22.8 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to increased investment in the Company's Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $11.4 million during 2004, as compared to $4.6 million in 2003.
Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $14.1 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $42.3 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily attributable to the equity in income from the increased investment in the RioCan joint venture investment ("RioCan Venture"), the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio joint venture investment ("KROP") and the Company's growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company had made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2004 and 2003.

During 2004, KDI, the Company's wholly-owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold 28 out-parcels, three completed phases of projects and five recently completed projects for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, net of income taxes of approximately $4.4 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, KDI sold four projects and 26 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $134.6 million which resulted in gains of approximately $10.5 million, net of income taxes of $7.0 million.
During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co-investment ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million.
As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
During 2003, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) ten operating shopping center properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $119.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $1.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, (ii) two regional malls for an aggregate sales price of approximately $135.6 million, (iii) one out-parcel for a sales price of approximately $8.1 million, (iv) transferred three operating properties to KROP for a price of approximately $144.2 million, (v) transferred an operating property to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling 10% interest for a price of approximately $21.9 million and (vi) terminated four leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $50.8 million.
During 2003, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $19.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.0 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Company's determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $15.4 million, was based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $4.0 million. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144 was applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $279.5, compared to $242.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations improved $0.17 to $1.18 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $1.01 for the preceding year. This improved performance was primarily attributable to (i) the incremental operating results from the acquisition of operating properties during 2004 and 2003, including the Mid-Atlantic Realty Trust transaction, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures resulting from additional capital investments in the RioCan Venture, KROP and other joint venture investments for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties during 2004 and 2003, (iii) an increase in management and other fee income related to the growth in the co-investment programs, (iv) increased income from other real estate investments and (v) significant leasing within the portfolio, which improved operating profitability.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $297.1 million, compared to $307.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, net income decreased $0.05 to $1.26 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower income from discontinued operations of $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the preceding year due to property sales during 2004 and 2003 and gains on early extinguishment of debt during 2003. In addition, the diluted per share results for the year ended December 31, 2003, were decreased by a reduction in net income available to common stockholders of $0.04 resulting from the deduction of original issuance costs associated with the redemption of the Company's 7% Class A, 8% Class B and 8 3/8% Class C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks during the second quarter of 2003.
Tenant Concentrations
The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2005, the Company's five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl's and Royal Ahold, which represented approximately 3.6%, 3.2%, 2.7%, 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions):
Back to Contents
     
Operating Activities
The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2004 and 2005, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Company's joint venture and Preferred Equity programs.
Investing Activities
     
Acquisitions and Redevelopments
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $376.0 million towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $55.5 million in connection with these major redevelopments and re-tenanting projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2006 will be approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Company's revolving lines of credit.
Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $267.3 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $130.6 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
Ground-up Development
The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects which consists of (i) merchant building through the Company's wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, KDI, which develops neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico and Canada for long-term investment. All ground-up development projects generally have substantial pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had in progress a total of 38 ground-up development projects including 26 merchant building projects, five domestic ground-up development projects, six ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico and one ground-up development project located in Canada.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $452.7 million in connection with the purchase of land and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2005. These projects are currently proceeding on schedule and substantially in line with the Company's budgeted costs. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2006 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $300 million to $350 million. The proceeds from the sales of the completed ground-up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Company's revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)

Dispositions and Transfers
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $348.4 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground-up development projects and approximately $128.5 million from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
Financing Activities
It is management's intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's level of debt to total market capitalization was 26%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure.
Since the completion of the Company's IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $4.2 billion for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments.
The Company has an $850.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in July 2008. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2005, there was $200.0 million outstanding under this credit facility.
During September 2004, the Company entered into a three-year Canadian denominated ("CAD") $150.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bears interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.50%, and is scheduled to expire in September 2007. During March 2005, this facility was increased to CAD $250.0 million and the scheduled maturity date was extended to March 2008. During January 2006, the facility was further amended to reduce the borrowing spread to 0.45% and to modify the covenant package to conform to the Company's $850.0 million U.S. Credit Facility. Proceeds from this facility will be used for general corporate purposes including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2005, there was CAD $110.0 million (approximately USD $94.7 million) outstanding under this credit facility.
During May 2005, the Company entered into a three-year Mexican Peso denominated ("MXP") 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined, plus 1.00% and is scheduled to expire in May 2008. Proceeds from this facility will be used to fund peso denominated investments. As of December 31, 2005, there was MXP 500.0 million (approximately USD $46.7 million) outstanding under this credit facility.
The Company has a MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time-to-time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Company's debt maturities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $250.0 million available for issuance under the MTN program. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)

In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had over 380 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.
During July 2005, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for up to $1.0 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $750.0 million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement.
In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $293.3 million in 2005, compared to $265.3 million in 2004 and $246.3 million in 2003.
Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 29 years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.9 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has 60 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 22 non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio.

The Company has $185.0 million of medium term notes, $14.1 million of mortgage debt and $87.7 million of construction loans maturing in 2006. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and the sale of completed ground-up development projects.

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Company's ground-up development projects, and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.8 million.
Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $6.0 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $4.6 million (approximately USD $4.0 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2005, relating to various development projects. In addition to the letter of credit facility, various additional Canadian development projects in which the Company holds interests ranging from 33 1/3% to 50% have letters of credit issued aggregating approximately CAD $3.5 million (approximately USD $3.0 million) at December 31, 2005.
During 2005, a joint venture entity in which the Company has a non-controlling interest obtained a CAD $22.5 million credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in May 2007. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million on this facility. As of December 31, 2005, there was no outstanding balance on this facility.
During 2005, the Company obtained a term loan and construction financing on two ground-up development projects for an aggregate net loan commitment amount of up to $50.5 million of which approximately $22.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 15 construction loans with total commitments of up to $343.5 million of which $228.5 million had been funded to the Company. These loans had maturities ranging from 4 months to 31 months and interest rates ranging from 6.04% to 6.64% at December 31, 2005.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     
Ground-Up Development Joint Ventures
At December 31, 2005, the Company has three ground-up development projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has 50% non-controlling interests. The projects are financed with individual non-recourse construction loans with total aggregate loan commitments of up to $219.6 million of which $58.8 million has been funded. These loans have variable interest rates ranging from 4.89% to 8.25% at December 31, 2005 and maturities ranging from 4 months to 18 months.
     
Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures
The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These investments include the Company's 43.3% non-controlling interest in KIR, the Company's 50% non-controlling interest in the RioCan Venture, the Company's 20% non-controlling interest in KROP, the Company's 15% non-controlling interest in Price Legacy and varying non-controlling interests in other real estate joint ventures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents.

The KIR joint venture was established for the purpose of investing in high quality real estate properties financed primarily with individual non-recourse mortgages. The Company believes that these properties are appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the Company traditionally uses. As of December 31, 2005, KIR had interests in 68 properties comprising 14.2 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, KIR had individual non-recourse mortgage loans of approximately $1.1 billion on 65 of these properties. These non-recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from less than one year to 14 years and rates ranging from 4.99% to 8.52%. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgages relating to the KIR joint venture was approximately $485.4 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
The RioCan Venture was established with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2005, the RioCan Venture consisted of 34 shopping center properties and one development project with approximately 8.1 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, the RioCan Venture had individual, non-recourse mortgage loans on 33 of these properties and a construction loan on its development property aggregating approximately CAD $706.3 million (USD $607.8 million). These loans have maturities ranging from less than one year to 28 years and rates ranging from 3.91% to 9.05%. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's pro-rata share of these non-recourse loans relating to the RioCan Venture was approximately CAD $349.2 million (USD $300.5 million). (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE"), was established to acquire high-growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, KROP consisted of 38 shopping center properties with approximately 5.6 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, KROP had non-recourse mortgage loans totaling $481.9 million, with fixed rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.64% and variable rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.3% to LIBOR plus 2.2%. KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable-rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 6.09% per annum.

As of December 31, 2005, KROP had no outstanding short term interim financing due to the Company or GECRE. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
During December 2004, the Company acquired the Price Legacy Corporation through a newly formed joint venture, PL Retail LLC ("PL Retail"), in which the Company has a non-controlling 15% interest.

The fixed-rate loans have maturities ranging from three to 11 years and the variable-rate loans have maturities ranging from one to three years. Additionally, the Company had provided PL Retail approximately $30.6 million of secured mezzanine financing. This interest only loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% and matures in December 2006. Proceeds from property sales during 2005 of approximately $21.8 million were used to partially repay the mezzanine financing that was provided by the Company. The Company also provided PL Retail a secured short-term promissory note of approximately $8.2 million. This interest only note bore interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% and was scheduled to mature in June 2005. During 2005, this note was amended to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6% and is now payable on demand. As of December 31, 2005, PL Retail had approximately $8.9 million outstanding on the mezzanine financing and approximately $8.2 million outstanding on the promissory note. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgages relating to PL Retail was approximately $116.6 million.

The Company's pro-rata share of these non-recourse mortgages was approximately $520.6 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
     
Other Real Estate Investments
During November 2002, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc., ("Kimsouth"). The Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Company's investment strategy with respect to Kimsouth includes re-tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. As a result of this strategy, Kimsouth has sold 33 properties as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Kimsouth portfolio was comprised of five properties, including the remaining office component of an operating property sold in 2004, totaling 1.2 million square feet of GLA with non-recourse mortgage debt of approximately $29.4 million encumbering the properties. All mortgages payable are collateralized by certain properties and are due in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2005, interest rates ranged from 6.06% to 9.22% and the weighted-average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 8.35% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse mortgage loans relating to the Kimsouth portfolio was approximately $13.1 million.
During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Company's cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment.
As of December 31, 2005, 14 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $24.2 million. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining 16 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $58.7 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease.
Back to Contents
The Company maintains a preferred equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of shopping centers. The Company accounts for its investments in preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's invested capital in its preferred equity investments approximated $225.9 million relating to 133 real estate properties. As of December 31, 2005, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $703.3 million. Due to the Company's preferred position in these investments, the Company's pro-rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.
Effects of Inflation
Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchange of Non-monetary Assets  an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ("SFAS No. 153"). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ("FIN 47"). FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 clarifies that the term "Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation" refers to a legal obligation (pursuant to existing laws or by contract) to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 was effective no later than fiscal years ended after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FIN 47 as required effective December 31, 2005, and the initial application of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ("SFAS No. 154"), which replaces Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles. It requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
In September 2005, the EITF issued Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, ("EITF 04-5"). At issue is what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This issue is effective no later than for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, and as of June 29, 2005, for new or modified arrangements. The impact of adopting EITF 04-5 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The following table presents the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2005, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company's reporting currency. The instruments actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos, as indicated by geographic region ($ in USD equivalent in millions).
Based on the Company's variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by approximately $6.8 million in 2005 if short-term interest rates were 1% higher.
As of December 31, 2005, the Company has Canadian investments totaling CAD $311.8 million (approximately USD $268.3 million) comprised of a real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of MXN 2.3 billion (approximately USD $215.4 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt, foreign currency forward contracts (the "Forward Contracts") and a cross currency swap (the "CC Swap") with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap with major financial institutions.
The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kimco Realty Corporation:
We have completed integrated audits of Kimco Realty Corporation's 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a) (1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15 (a) (2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York March 6, 2006, except with respect to our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules insofar as they relate to the effects of the discontinued operations as discussed in Notes 1, 6, 22 and 23 as to which the date is July 27, 2006.
