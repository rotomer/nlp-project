Kimco's third quarter funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, rose 19.2 percent to $138.6 million from $116.3 million for the same period last year. On a per share basis, third quarter FFO increased 12.0 percent to $0.56 from $0.50 a year ago. Quarterly FFO excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties net of minority interests and joint venture properties of approximately $5.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2006 and approximately $5.6 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2005.

Kimco Realty Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Weighted Average Share Information Note: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period's presentation. (1) Included in the calculation of income from continuing operations per share in accordance with SEC guidelines. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Net income would be increased by $747 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. (3) The potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included.
Kimco Realty Corporation Funds From Operations (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Weighted Average Share Information (1) Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including the Company, generally consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $2,544 and $1,739 for the three months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $6,733 and $4,954 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.

Kimco Realty Corporation Reconciliation of Projected Diluted Net Income Per Common Share to Projected Funds From Operations Per Common Share (Unaudited) Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management's estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
