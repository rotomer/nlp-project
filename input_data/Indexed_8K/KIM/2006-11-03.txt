ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. 1. MERGER AGREEMENT. On October 30, 2006, Kimco Realty Corporation ("Kimco"), KRC Acquisition Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Merger Sub"), KRC CT Acquisition Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("CTOP Merger Sub"), KRC PC Acquisition Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("Pinecreek Merger Sub"), Pan Pacific Retail Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Pan Pacific"), CT Operating Partnership, L.P., a California limited partnership ("CTOP") and Western/Pinecreek, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Pinecreek OP") entered into an amendment ("Amendment") to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 9, 2006, by and between Kimco, Merger Sub, CTOP Merger Sub, Pinecreek Merger Sub, Pan Pacific, CTOP and Pinecreek OP (the "Merger Agreement"). The Amendment provided that the parties were not required to consummate the merger of CTOP with and into CTOP Merger Sub or the merger of Pinecreek Merger Sub into Pinecreek OP. The Amendment also removed the requirement that the merger consideration be reduced by the proceeds of sales of asset sales occurring immediately prior to the closing of the merger of Merger Sub with and into Pan Pacific (the "Merger"). The Merger was consummated on October 31, 2006. As a result of the Merger, Pan Pacific became an indirect subsidiary of Kimco and Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI"). In connection with the Merger, substantially all of the assets of Pan Pacific were transferred to Kimco and then transferred by Kimco to various joint ventures between Kimco and PREI, where they will be held. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of Pan Pacific's shares of common stock were converted into the right to receive approximately $60.24 in cash, including approximately $0.24 in prorated dividends, and 0.2253 shares of Kimco common stock. Each outstanding and unexercised option of Pan Pacific was fully accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of $70 over the exercise price of the option, and (b) the number of shares of Pan Pacific common stock issuable pursuant to the unexercised portion of such option. Each share of restricted stock of Pan Pacific was fully accelerated and the contractual restrictions thereon terminated. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.4 billion in cash and 9.2 million shares of Kimco common stock. Before the Merger, Pan Pacific was the largest neighborhood shopping center REIT focused exclusively on the West Coast, with a portfolio of 138 properties encompassing approximately 22.6 million square feet of retail space. The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. 2. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. As a result of the Merger and the transactions occurring in connection therewith, on October 31, 2006, Kimco assumed the obligations associated with Pan Pacific' debt securities issued under the Indenture dated as of September 1, 1997, as supplemented, between Pan Pacific (as successor to Western Investment Real Estate Trust) and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Indenture, dated as of April 6, 2001, between Pan Pacific and the Trustee, pursuant to the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated October 31, 2006, between Kimco, Pan Pacific and the Trustee and the First Supplemental Indenture, dated October 31, 2006, between Kimco, Pan Pacific and the Trustee (together with the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indentures"). The aggregate face value of the debt securities outstanding under the Indentures is $630 million. The foregoing description of the Indentures does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indentures, which are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and 4.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. 3.

Kimco agreed to guarantee the full amount of the Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Other Guarantors each guaranteed a percentage of the loan commensurate with their ownership interest in the Borrower. PREI guaranteed reimbursement to Kimco of 85% of any guaranty payment Kimco is obligated to make.

Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

SECTION 2.6 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender(s) (as conclusively certified by such Lender(s) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period; the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, (i) any Eurocurrency Loans requested to be made on the Borrowing Date shall be made as ABR Loans (ii) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency Loans shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans, and (iii) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

SECTION 2.7 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. (a) Each Borrowing shall be made (on the Borrowing Occasion), continued, or converted pro rata according to the respective Applicable Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the Lenders. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 12.2 in immediately available funds. It is understood that, if any payment of principal is made on any day in accordance with the preceding sentence, no interest shall accrue on such day in respect of such principal. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to any such payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to the Borrowing Date that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time of the Borrowing Occasion, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.7(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of the Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower. SECTION 2.8 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, to continue Eurocurrency Loans as such, or to convert 27
ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall forthwith be cancelled, and (b) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.11. SECTION 2.9 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date: (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note, or any Eurocurrency Loan or Money Market Loan, made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except in each case for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.10 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except to the extent that such reserve is specifically subject to Section 2.9(c)), special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any relevant office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate or the Money Market Rate; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or Money Market Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, (x) the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable, and (y) the Borrower agrees to pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable with respect to this Agreement or the Commitments generally and not solely with respect to any particular Borrower's Loans. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(a), it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, provided that such amounts shall be no greater than amounts that such Lender is generally charging other borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the application of any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's treatment of its Commitments for internal purposes as of the date on which it became a party hereto) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative 28
Agent) of a written request therefor (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such request), (i) the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, or such corporation, for such reduction, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, for such reduction with respect to this Agreement or the Commitments. (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender which requests compensation under this Section 2.9(c) (by notice to the Borrower), on the last day of each Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan of such Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Lender may be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes any Eurocurrency Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower) representing such Lender's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation as such Lender shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Lender during such Interest Period, as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such Eurocurrency Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender to which such Interest Period relates and outstanding on such day; and (ii) the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Eurocurrency Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan, and the denominator of which is one (1) MINUS the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date MINUS (y) such numerator; and (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is 360. Any Lender which gives notice under this Section 2.9(c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) in the event such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease to exist. (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.9 submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section 2.9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (the date on which all of the foregoing shall have occurred, the "FINAL DATE"), until the first anniversary of the Final Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.9, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any greater amounts than such Lender(s) is (are) generally charging other borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower. SECTION 2.10 TAXES. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or 29
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("NON-EXCLUDED TAXES") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Notes; PROVIDED that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Non-U.S. Lender if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of Section 2.10(b). Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 2.10(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. (b) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a citizen or resident of the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, or any estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (a "NON-U.S. LENDER") shall deliver (on or prior to the Borrowing Date in the case of any such Person that is a Lender as of the Borrowing Date) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S. Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN, an annual certificate representing under penalty of perjury that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, (i) each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender and (ii) each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver any and all other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower from time to time so as to provide a complete (or the greatest extent possible) exemption from U.S federal withholding tax and any other jurisdiction's withholding tax on any and all payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it 30
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.10(b), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (c) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a Non-U.S. Lender (a "U.S. LENDER") shall deliver (on or prior to the Borrowing Date in the case of any such Person that is a Lender as of the Borrowing Date) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such U.S. Lender. Such form shall be delivered by each U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, (i) each U.S. Lender shall deliver such form promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such U.S. Lender and (ii) each U.S. Lender shall deliver any and all other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower from time to time so as to provide a complete (or the greatest extent possible) exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and any other jurisdiction's withholding tax on any and all payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.10(c), a U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) that such U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. SECTION 2.11 INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense (including post-judgment expenses) which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making the borrowing of any Eurocurrency Loans or Money Market Loans, or in the conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans or Money Market Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting or accepting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or (c) the making of a prepayment or conversion of Eurocurrency Loans or Money Market Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period or a Money Market Rate Period, as the case may be, with respect thereto. Such indemnification may, at the option of any Lender, include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid or converted, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the relevant Interest Period or the relevant Money Market Rate Period (or proposed Interest Period or proposed Money Market Rate Period, as the case may be), in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin) OVER (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurocurrency market or other relevant market. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder, until the first anniversary of the Final Date.

Each Lender and each Transferee agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.8, 2.9 or 2.10 with respect to such Lender or Transferee, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender 31
or Transferee) to designate another lending office for Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; PROVIDED that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender or Transferee, cause such Lender or Transferee and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender or Transferee pursuant to Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10.

The Loans and the obligations hereunder of each Guarantor shall not be contractually subordinated to any other obligations of the Borrower or of such Guarantor.

(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption (as defined below) with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, PROVIDED that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption substantially in the form of Exhibit A or in any other form approved by the Administrative Agent (an "ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION"), together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,000 (which, except as provided in Section 2.13, shall not be payable by the Borrower); and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in the form approved by the Administrative Agent (an "ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE"). For the purposes of this Section 12.6, the term "APPROVED FUND" has the following meaning: "APPROVED FUND" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 12.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, or the principal amount of the Loans, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register 60
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in this paragraph (b) and any written consent to such assignment required by this paragraph (b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; PROVIDED that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.7(b), 2.7(b), 3.4, 3.5 or 11.2, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations in respect of its Commitment, under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment or the Loans owing to it); PROVIDED that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (C) the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 12.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.12(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.12(a) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.9 or 2.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Kimco's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.10(a) unless Kimco is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.10(b) as though it were a Lender. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 61
SECTION 12.7 DISCLOSURE. Subject to Section 12.19, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or assignee (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates and the Acquisition which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement. SECTION 12.8 [RESERVED]. SECTION 12.9 FTC GUARANTEE. (a) GUARANTEE BY FIRST TIER COMPANIES. In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make or maintain the Loans hereunder, and in consideration thereof, the First Tier Companies (in their capacities as the guarantors under this Section 12.9, the "FTC GUARANTORS") hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, guarantee, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, up to their respective FTG Percentages thereof, the prompt and complete payment by the Borrower when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, and each FTC Guarantor further agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing any of their rights against such FTC Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9; PROVIDED that the amount payable at any time by any particular FTC Guarantor shall be limited to the amount determined under Section 12.9(i) hereof. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9, subject to Section 12.9(d), shall remain in full force and effect, as limited in amount hereunder, until the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated. Each FTC Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability under this Section 12.9, it will notify the Administrative Agent or such Lender in writing that such payment is made under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 for such purpose, provided that failure to provide such notice shall not alter or affect the amount of such FTC Guarantor's liability hereunder or its FTG Percentage. No payment or payments made by the Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any FTC Guarantor under this Section 12.9, which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for the unpaid and outstanding Obligations, up to its FTG Percentage thereof, until, subject to Section 12.9(d), the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated. (b) AMENDMENTS, ETC. WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each FTC Guarantor shall remain obligated under this Section 12.9 notwithstanding that (i) without any reservation of rights against any FTC Guarantor, and (ii) without notice to or further assent by any FTC Guarantor, (x) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded, (y) any of the Obligations may be continued, increased in amount, or otherwise modified, and the applicable Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any 62
Lender, and (z) this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Lenders (or the Requisite Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the applicable Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 or any property subject thereto. (c) GUARANTEE ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL. Each FTC Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 or acceptance of the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9, and all dealings between any FTC Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9. The Administrative Agent and any Lender will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, request payment of any applicable Obligation from the Borrower before making any claim against the FTC Guarantors under this Section 12.9, but will have no further obligation to proceed against the Borrower or to defer for any period a claim against any FTC Guarantor hereunder. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, each FTC Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon any FTC Guarantor or the Borrower with respect to the Obligations. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor or Guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) the legality under applicable laws of repayment by the Borrower of any Obligations or the adoption of any applicable laws purporting to render any Obligations null and void, (c) any change in the structure or tax characterization of the Borrower, or any transaction (including any merger or consolidation) to which it may be a party (in each case whether or not permitted under the Loan Documents), (d) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any FTC Guarantor or the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (e) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any FTC Guarantor or the Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for any Obligations, or of any FTC Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When the Administrative Agent or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this Section 12.9 against any FTC Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or Guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or Guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, Guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any FTC Guarantor of any liability under this Section 12.9, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against any FTC Guarantor. 63
(d) REINSTATEMENT. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its Property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. (e) PAYMENTS. Each FTC Guarantor hereby agrees that any payments in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Section 12.9 will be paid without setoff or counterclaim in Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent specified for payment under this Agreement. (f) INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of each FTC Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.9 are independent of the obligations of the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any FTC Guarantor whether or not the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each FTC Guarantor. (g) DEFENSES OF FTC GUARANTOR. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each FTC Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise, extend or otherwise adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Loan Party or any other guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any FTC Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, each FTC Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any FTC Guarantor against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, as the case may be, or any security, or would otherwise exonerate any FTC Guarantor. (h) AGREEMENT TO PAY; SUBORDINATION. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against the FTC Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each FTC Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations, up to its FTG Percentage thereof. Upon payment by any FTC Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as provided above, all rights of such FTC Guarantor against any Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any FTC Guarantor on account of such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to 64
the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. (i) LIMITATIONS. The maximum liability of each FTC Guarantor under this Section 12.9 (and accordingly the liability of such FTC Guarantor that is secured by Collateral in which such FTC Guarantor has granted a security interest securing its obligations hereunder) shall be limited as provided in paragraph (a). For purposes of this Agreement, the "FTG PERCENTAGE" of each FTC Guarantor shall be the percentage set forth opposite the name of such FTC Guarantor on Schedule 12.9; PROVIDED, that if there is an Event of Default which affects only a particular First Tier Company (a "DEFAULTING FTC") so that, pursuant to the proviso at the end of the penultimate paragraph of Article X, only a portion of the Obligations become due and payable, and such portion is paid by the Borrower or Kimco, thereafter the FTG Percentage of each First Tier Company other than the Defaulting FTC shall be adjusted to be equal to the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator of which is the FTG Percentage of such First Tier Company immediately prior to such default, and the denominator of which is the sum of the FTG Percentages immediately prior to such default of all of the First Tier Companies other than the Defaulting FTC. SECTION 12.10 KIMCO GUARANTEE. (a) GUARANTEE BY KIMCO. In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make or maintain the Loans hereunder, and in consideration thereof, Kimco (in its capacity as the guarantor under this Section 12.10, the "INVESTOR GUARANTOR") hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, the prompt and complete payment by the Borrower when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, and the Investor Guarantor further agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing any of their rights under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10, subject to Section 12.10(d), shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated. The Investor Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability under this Section 12.10, it will notify the Administrative Agent or such Lender in writing that such payment is made under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 for such purpose. No payment or payments made by the Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Investor Guarantor under this Section 12.10, which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for the unpaid and outstanding Obligations until, subject to Section 12.10(d), the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated. (b) AMENDMENTS, ETC. WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABLE OBLIGATIONS. The Investor Guarantor shall remain obligated under this Section 12.10 notwithstanding that (i) without any reservation of rights against the Investor Guarantor, and (ii) without notice to or further assent by the Investor Guarantor, (x) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (y) any of the Obligations may be continued, increased in amount, or otherwise modified, and the applicable Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, 65
accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and (z) this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Lenders (or the Requisite Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the applicable Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 or any property subject thereto. (c) GUARANTEE ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL. The Investor Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 or acceptance of the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10, and all dealings between the Investor Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10. The Administrative Agent and any Lender will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, request payment of any applicable Obligation from the Borrower before making any claim against the Investor Guarantor under this Section 12.10, but will have no further obligation to proceed against the Borrower or to defer for any period a claim against the Investor Guarantor hereunder. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, the Investor Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Investor Guarantor or the Borrower with respect to the Obligations. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor or Guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) the legality under applicable laws of repayment by the Borrower of any Obligations or the adoption of any applicable laws purporting to render any Obligations null and void, (c) any change in the structure or tax characterization of the Borrower, or any transaction (including any merger or consolidation) to which it may be a party (in each case whether or not permitted under the Loan Documents), (d) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Investor Guarantor or the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (e) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Investor Guarantor or the Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for any Obligations, or of the Investor Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When the Administrative Agent or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this Section 12.10 against the Investor Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or Guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or Guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, Guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Investor Guarantor of any liability under this Section 12.10, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against the Investor Guarantor. 66
(d) REINSTATEMENT. The Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its Property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. (e) PAYMENTS. The Investor Guarantor hereby agrees that any payments in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Section 12.10 will be paid without setoff or counterclaim, in Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent specified for payment under this Agreement. (f) INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the Investor Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 are independent of the obligations of the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Investor Guarantor whether or not the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the Investor Guarantor. (g) DEFENSES OF INVESTOR GUARANTOR. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Investor Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise, extend or otherwise adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Loan Party or any other guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Investor Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, the Investor Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Investor Guarantor against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, as the case may be, or any security, or would otherwise exonerate the Investor Guarantor. (h) AGREEMENT TO PAY; SUBORDINATION. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against the Investor Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Investor Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations. Upon payment by the Investor Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as provided above, all rights of the Investor Guarantor against any Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to the Investor Guarantor on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the 67
Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. SECTION 12.11 RESERVED. SECTION 12.12 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED" Lender) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Exposure or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Article X(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Exposure or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Exposure, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; PROVIDED that (i) if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender and each of its Affiliates shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, obligations, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any of its Affiliates or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. SECTION 12.13 COUNTERPARTS.
