On a per diluted share basis, net income increased 13.3 percent to $0.51 from $0.45 reported for the fourth quarter last year. Funds from operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, rose 16.0 percent to $147.8 million during the quarter from $127.5 million for the same period last year. On a per diluted share basis, fourth quarter FFO increased 5.5 percent to $0.58 from $0.55 a year ago. Funds from operations excludes gains on dispositions of operating properties net of minority interests and joint venture properties of approximately $44.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share in 2006 and $19.0 million, or approximately $0.08 per share in 2005.

The impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included. (3) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Net income would be increased by $1,739 for the three months ended December 31, 2005.

FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting changes, gains on sales of operating real estate, plus the pro-rata amount of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of minority interests, determined on a consistent basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items. (2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $2,410 and $1,739 for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $8,587 and $6,693 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting the distributions associated with these units.
