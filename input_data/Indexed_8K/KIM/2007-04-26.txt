     (h) The Company will use its best efforts to meet the requirements to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code for the taxable year in which sales of the Underwritten Securities are to occur.

provided in the applicable Terms Agreement. You may release us from the obligations of this Section 3(j) in your sole discretion at any time without notice.
     (k) If the Underwritten Securities are convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive or other similar rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligation to issue such shares upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities.
     (l) If the Underwritten Securities are convertible into Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Company will use its best efforts to list shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issuable upon conversion of the Underwritten Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or such other national exchange on which the Company's Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, is then listed.
     (m) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains your prior consent, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains your prior consent and the prior consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Underwritten Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; , that the Underwriters are authorized to use any free writing prospectus that contains substantially only information specified in the Final Term Sheet.

If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereunder in connection with such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any
 
investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     Section 7. . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the offering of the Underwritten Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the Underwriters in respect of such offering, as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement in respect of such offering bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities purchased by it pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses. The Underwriters' obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

See "Description of the Notes  Change of Control Triggering Event" in the Prospectus.
Coupon Step-Up
     If the rating on the Underwritten Securities from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") is a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the per annum interest rate on the Underwritten Securities will increase from that set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
     If the rating on the Underwritten Securities from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc. ("S&P"), is a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the per annum interest rate on the Underwritten Securities will increase from that set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
     If Moody's or S&P subsequently increases its rating to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the per annum interest rate on the Underwritten Securities will be decreased such that the per annum interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the per annum interest rate on the Underwritten Securities be reduced below the interest rate set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, and (2) the total increase in the per annum interest rate on the Underwritten Securities exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus.
     If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Underwritten Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Underwritten Securities shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Underwritten Securities will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease, as described above, will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment to the interest rate on the Underwritten Securities as described above.

any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Various issues concerning the laws of the State of Maryland are addressed in the opinion of Venable LLP, which has been separately provided to you and attached hereto as Exhibit A. We express no opinion with respect to those matters herein, and to the extent elements of those opinions are necessary to the conclusion expressed herein, we have, with your consent, assumed such matters.
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, when the Notes have been duly executed, issued, and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinions are subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies, or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 514 of the Base Indenture, (d) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy, (e) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon, and (f) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect. We express no opinion or confirmation as to federal or state securities laws, tax laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws, antifraud laws, compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, stock exchange rules and environmental laws (without limiting other laws excluded by customary practice).
     With your consent, we have assumed (a) that the Indenture and the Notes (collectively, the "Documents") have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto, (b) that the Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (c) that the status of the Documents as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities.

          3. Each of the parties (other than the Company) executing any of the Documents has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents to which such party is a signatory, and such party's obligations set forth therein are legal, valid and binding and are enforceable in accordance with all stated terms.
          4. All Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic. The form and content of all Documents submitted to us as unexecuted drafts do not differ in any respect relevant to this opinion from the form and content of such Documents as executed and delivered. All Documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original documents. All signatures on all such Documents are genuine.
