Pursuant to the definition of Funds from Operations ("FFO") adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains from sales of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance and FFO is a widely recognized measure in the Company's industry. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items.
