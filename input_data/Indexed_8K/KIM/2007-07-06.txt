Executive Summary
 
Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of January 31, 2007, the Company had interests in 1,348 properties totaling approximately 175.4 million square feet of GLA located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
 
The Company is self-administered and self-managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company.
 
In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate-related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its KDI subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise.
 
In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management's judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate.
 
The Company's strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2006 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.36 from $0.33, effective for the third quarter of 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
 
Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.
 
The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.
 
 
The Company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
 
Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-
 
8
 
 
market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life.
 
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
 
 
The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income.
 
Real estate under development on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These assets are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in management's opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales.
 
 
On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
 
When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
 
9
 
 
 
The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances.
 
Results of Operations
 
 
Revenues from rental property increased $85.5 million or 17.0% to $588.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with $503.0 million for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2005. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2005 and 2006, providing incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $72.3 million, (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 95.5% at December 31, 2006, as compared to 94.6% at December 31, 2005 and the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects providing incremental revenues of approximately $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, tenant buyouts, and the sale of certain properties during 2005 and 2006.
 
Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $65.4 million or 28.0% to $299.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with $233.9 million for the corresponding year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities.
 
Mortgage and other financing income decreased $8.8 million to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $27.6 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This decrease is primarily due to the recognition in 2005 of a prepayment fee of $14.0 million received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company, offset by accretion income of approximately $6.2 million received in 2006, resulting from an early pre-payment of a mortgage receivable in June 2006, which had been acquired at a discount.
 
Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from the Kimsouth portfolio and growth in the Company's other co-investment programs.
 
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to personnel-related costs including the non-cash expensing of stock options granted, attributable to the growth of the Company.
 
Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to greater realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities and increased interest and dividend income as a result of higher cash balances and the growth in the marketable securities portfolio during
2006 and 2005.
 
10
 
 
 
Interest expense increased $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt during this period as compared to the same period in the preceding year.
 
Income from other real estate investments increased $20.3 million to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $56.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased investment in the Company's Preferred Equity program which contributed $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, including $12.2 million of profit participation earned from 16 capital transactions, as compared to $32.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005, including $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six capital transactions and (ii) pre-tax profits of $7.9 million from the transfer of two properties from Kimsouth to a joint venture in which the Company has an 18% non-controlling interest. These profits exclude amounts that have been deferred as a result of the Company's continued ownership interest.
 
Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $29.5 million to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $77.5 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) increase in equity in income from the KROP primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately $22.2 million and gains from the sale of nine operating properties, one land parcel and one out-parcel during 2006 of which the pro-rata share of gains to the Company were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and (ii) the Company's growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other
joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties by the ventures throughout 2005 and 2006.
 
During 2006, KDI sold six recently completed projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income taxes of $12.2 million. These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Company's continued ownership interest.
 
During 2005, KDI, sold in separate transactions, 41 out-parcels and six recently completed projects for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million.
 
During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease, for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred property.
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2007, the Company disposed of two operating properties and a portion of one operating property, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $13.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $3.5 million, net of income tax of approximately $0.5 million.
 
11
 
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2007, the Company classified as held-for-sale three shopping center properties comprising approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA. The book value of each of these properties, aggregating approximately $42.9 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.2 million, did not exceed each of their estimated fair values. As a result, no adjustment of property carrying value has been recorded. The Company's determination of the fair value for each of these properties, aggregating approximately $69.0 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs.
 
The current and prior comparative years operations of properties classified as held-for-sale as of March 31, 2007 are included in the caption Income from discounted operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
During 2005, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, and (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million.
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $428.3 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $363.6 million. On a diluted per share basis, net income improved $0.18 to $1.70 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $1.52 for the corresponding period in 2005. These increases are attributable to (i) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, (ii) increased income from other real estate investments primarily due to increased investments in the Company's Preferred Equity program, (iii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investment in the Company's joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2006 and 2005, (iv) increased gains on sales of operating properties in 2006 and (v) increased income contributed from the marketable securities portfolio in 2006 as compared to 2005, partially offset by, (vi) an increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings during 2006.
 
 
Revenues from rental property increased $14.1 million or 2.9% to $503.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $488.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2005 and 2004 providing incremental revenues of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 94.6% at December 31, 2005, as compared to 93.6% at December 31, 2004 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period in 2004, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period in 2004, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2005 and 2004.
 
Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $13.5 million or 6.1% to $233.9 million for the year ended December
 
12
 
 
31, 2005, as compared with $220.3 million for the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2005 and 2004, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities.
 
Mortgage and other financing income increased $12.6 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase primarily relates to a $14.0 million prepayment fee received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company.
 
Management and other fee income increased approximately $5.0 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $25.5 million in the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co-investment programs.
 
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $12.2 million to $56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $44.6 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, due in part to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) a $3.0 million increase due to the non-cash expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted and (iii) increased personnel and systems related costs associated with the growth of the Company.
 
Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $9.6 million to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $18.7 million in 2004. This increase is primarily due to greater dividend income and realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities during 2005 as compared to the preceding year.
 
Interest expense increased $20.7 million to $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2005.
 
Income from other real estate investments increased $26.6 million to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $30.1 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Company's Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $32.8 million during 2005, including an aggregate of approximately $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six capital transactions during 2005, as compared to $11.4 million in 2004.
 
Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $21.1 million to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $56.4 million for the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) the increased equity in income from KIR resulting from the sale of two operating properties during 2005 which provided an aggregate gain of $20.2 million, of which the pro-rata share to the Company was $8.7 million, (ii) increased equity in income in three joint venture investments resulting from the sale of two operating properties and one development property during 2005, which provided aggregate gains of approximately $17.9 million, of which the pro-rata share to the Company was approximately $8.8 million, and (iii) the Company's growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004.

During 2005, KDI, the Company's wholly-owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold six completed projects and 41 out-parcels for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million.
 
During 2004, KDI, in separate transactions, sold five completed projects, three completed phases of projects and 28 out-parcels for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, after income taxes of approximately $4.4 million.
 
During 2005, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million.
 
During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co-investment ventures in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million.
 
As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $363.6 million, compared to $297.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.26 to $1.52 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $1.26 for the previous year. This increase is attributable to (i) increased income from other real estate investments, primarily from the Company's Preferred Equity program, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from gains on sales of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Company's joint venture programs for the
 
14
 
 
acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004, (iii) increased income contributed from mortgage and other financing receivables as compared to last year and (iv) increased gains on sale/transfer of development and operating properties during 2005, as compared to the same period during 2004.
 
Tenant Concentrations
 
The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2006, the Company's five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl's and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.5%, 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The Company's cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
Operating Activities
 
The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2005 and 2006, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Company's joint venture and Preferred Equity programs.
 
Investing Activities
 
Acquisitions and Redevelopments
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $484.8 million towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $62.2 million in connection with these major redevelopments and re-tenanting projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2007 will be approximately $125.0 million to $150.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Company's revolving lines of credit.
 
15
 
 
Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $472.7 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $183.4 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
Ground-up Development
 
The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects which consists of (i) merchant building through the Company's wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, KDI, which develops neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico and Canada for long-term investment. All ground-up development projects generally have substantial pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had in progress a total of 45 ground-up development projects including 23 merchant building projects, six domestic ground-up development projects, and 16 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $619.1 million in connection with the purchase of land and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2006. These projects are currently proceeding on schedule and substantially in line with the Company's budgeted costs. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2007 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $550 million to $600 million. The proceeds from the sales of the completed ground-up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Company's revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
Dispositions and Transfers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $342.8 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground-up development projects and approximately $1.2 billion from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
Financing Activities
 
It is management's intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2006, the Company's level of debt to total market capitalization was 23%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure.
 
16
 
 
 
Since the completion of the Company's IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $4.9 billion. Proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap corporations, most of which are U.S. corporations.
 
The Company has an $850.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in July 2008. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.
 
The Company also has a three-year CAD $250.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bore interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.50%, and is scheduled to expire in March 2008. During January 2006, the facility was further amended to reduce the borrowing spread to 0.45% and to modify the covenant package to conform to the Company's $850.0 million U.S. Credit Facility. Proceeds from this facility are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.
 
Additionally, the Company has a three-year MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined therein, plus 1.00% and is scheduled to expire in May 2008. Proceeds from this facility are used to fund peso denominated investments. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.
 
The Company has a MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time-to-time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Company's debt maturities. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
During March 2006, the Company issued $300.0 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes under its MTN program. This fixed rate MTN matures March 15, 2016 and bears interest at 5.783% per annum. The proceeds from this MTN issuance were primarily used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the Company's U.S. revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
 
During June 2006, the Company entered into a third supplemental indenture, under the indenture governing its medium-term notes and senior notes, which amended the (i) total debt test and secured debt test by changing the asset value definition from undepreciated real estate assets to total assets, with total assets being defined as undepreciated real estate assets, plus other assets (but excluding goodwill and amortized debt costs) and (ii) maintenance of unencumbered total asset value covenant by increasing the requirement of the ratio of unencumbered total asset value to outstanding unsecured debt from 1 to 1 to 1.5 to 1. Additionally, the same amended covenants were adopted within the Canadian supplemental indenture, which governs the 4.45% Canadian Debentures due in 2010. As a result of the amended covenants, the Company has increased its borrowing capacity by approximately $2.0 billion.
 
17
 
 
 
During August 2006, Kimco North Trust III, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the issuance of $200.0 million Canadian denominated senior unsecured notes. The notes bear interest at 5.18% and mature on August 16, 2013. The proceeds were used by Kimco North Trust III, to pay down outstanding indebtedness under existing credit facilities, to fund long-term investments in Canadian real estate and for general corporate purposes.
 
In connection with the October 31, 2006, Pan Pacific merger transaction, the Company assumed $650.0 million of unsecured notes payable, including $20.0 million of fair value debt premiums. These notes bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 4.70% to 7.95% per annum and have maturity dates ranging from June 29, 2007 to September 1, 2015 (see Recent Developments  Operating Real Estate Joint Venture Investments - Pan Pacific Retail Properties Inc. and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).
 
During 2006, the Company repaid its $30.0 million 6.93% fixed rate notes, which matured on July 20, 2006, $100.0 million floating rate notes, which matured on August 1, 2006, and $55.0 million 7.50% fixed rate notes, which matured on November 5, 2006.
 
In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had over 390 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.
 
During March 2006, the Company completed a primary public stock offering of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The net proceeds from this sale of Common Stock, totaling approximately $405.5 million (after related transaction costs of $2.5 million) were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance under the Company's U.S. revolving credit facility, partial repayment of the outstanding balance under the Company's Canadian denominated credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
 
During March 2006, the shareholders of Atlantic Realty approved a proposed merger with the Company, and the closing occurred on March 31, 2006. As consideration for this transaction, the Company issued Atlantic Realty shareholders 1,274,420 shares of Common Stock, excluding 748,510 shares of Common Stock that were to be received by the Company, at a price of $40.41 per share. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
During May 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which is effective for a term of three years, for the unlimited future offerings, from time to time, of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants.
 
On September 25, 2006, Pan Pacific stockholders approved the proposed merger with the Company and the closing occurred on October 31, 2006. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pan Pacific for a total merger consideration of $70.00 per share. As permitted under the merger agreement, the Company elected to issue $10.00 per share of the total merger consideration in the form of Common Stock. As such, the Company issued 9,185,847 million shares of Common Stock valued at approximately $407.7 million (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).
 
18
 
 
 
During 2006, the Company received approximately $43.8 million through employee stock option exercises and the dividend reinvestment program.
 
In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $332.6 million in 2006, compared to $293.3 million in 2005 and $265.3 million in 2004.
 
Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
 
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
 
The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 29 years. As of December 31, 2006, the Company's total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 5.7 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has 82 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 20 non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Company's debt maturities and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2006 (in millions):
 
 
The Company has $250.0 million of medium term notes, $42.8 million of mortgage debt and $164.2 million of construction loans maturing in 2007. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and the sale of completed ground-up development projects.
 
The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Company's ground-up development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.9 million.
 
19
 
 
During October 2006, the Company closed on the Pan Pacific merger, which had a total value of approximately $4.1 billion. Funding for this transaction was provided by approximately $1.3 billion of new individual non-recourse mortgage loans encumbering 51 properties, a $1.2 billion two year credit facility provided by a consortium of banks and guaranteed by the joint venture partners described below and the Company, the issuance of 9,185,847 shares of Common Stock valued at approximately $407.7 million, which was based upon the average closing price of Common Stock over the ten trading days immediately preceding the closing date, the assumption of approximately $630.0 million of unsecured bonds and approximately $289.4 million of existing non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering 23 properties and approximately $300.0 million in cash. With respect to the $1.2 billion guarantee by the Company, PREI, as defined below, guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. The Company evaluated this guarantee in connection with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and determined that the impact did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
Immediately following the merger, the Company commenced its joint venture agreements with Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI") through three separate accounts managed by PREI. In accordance with the joint venture agreements, all Pan Pacific assets and the approximate $1.6 billion of non-recourse mortgage debt and the $1.2 billion credit facility mentioned above were transferred to the separate accounts. PREI contributed approximately $1.1 billion on behalf of institutional investors in three of its portfolios. The Company holds 15% non-controlling ownership interests in each of these joint ventures, with a total aggregate investment of approximately $194.8 million, and will account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. In addition, the Company will manage the portfolios and earn acquisition fees, leasing commissions, property management fees and construction management fees.
 
During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a non-recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $40.0 million (approximately USD $35.8 million) outstanding on this construction loan.
 
Additionally, during 2006, KROP obtained a one year $15.0 million unsecured term loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.5%. This loan is guaranteed by the Company and GECRE has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 80% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make.
 
In connection with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately $92.5 million bonds outstanding.
 
Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $6.0 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $3.9 million (approximately USD $3.4 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2006, relating to various development projects.
 
20
 
 
During 2005, a joint venture entity in which the Company has a non-controlling interest obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD $19.3 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in May 2007. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $6.4 million) on this facility. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $21.0 million (approximately USD $18.0 million) outstanding on this facility.
 
During 2005, PL Retail entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.675% and was scheduled to mature in February 2007. During 2007, the loan was extended to February 2008 at a reduced rate of LIBOR plus 0.45%. This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2006, there was $39.5 million outstanding under this facility.
 
Additionally, during 2005, the Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint ventures, in which the Company holds 50% non-controlling interests. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual one-year loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%. During 2006, these term loans were extended for an additional year. These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner.
 
During 2006, the Company obtained construction financing on three ground-up development projects for an original loan commitment amount of up to $83.8 million of which approximately $36.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a total of 13 construction loans with total commitments of up to $330.9 million of which $271.0 million had been funded to the Company. These loans had maturities ranging from two months to 31 months and interest rates ranging from 6.87% to 7.32% at December 31, 2006.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
 
At December 31, 2006, the Company has three ground-up development projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has 50% non-controlling interests. Two projects are financed with individual non-recourse construction loans and one term loan with total aggregate loan commitments of up to $249.4 million of which $128.6 million has been funded. These loans have variable interest rates ranging from 5.82% to 8.25% at December 31, 2006, and maturities ranging from four months to 10 months.
 
Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures
 
The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or
 
21
 
 
any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). These investments include the following joint ventures:
 
 
 
(a)    Ownership % is a blended rate.
 
(b)    KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest          rates on its variable-rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual          shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest.
 
(c)    See Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments regarding guarantees by the Company and its joint          venture partners.
 
The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. As of December 31, 2006, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $2.2 billion. The Company's pro-rata share of these non-recourse mortgages was approximately $734.1 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
 
 
The Company maintains a Preferred Equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties. The Company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2006, the Company's net investment under the Preferred Equity Program was approximately $400.4 million relating to 215 properties. As of December 31, 2006, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1.2 billion. Due to the Company's preferred position in these investments, the Company's pro-rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital.
 
22
 
 
During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Company's cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment.
 
As of December 31, 2006, 16 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $29.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining 14 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $53.8 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease.
 
Effects of Inflation
 
Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FIN 48"), regarding accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. This guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the provisions of FIN 48, but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
 
23
 
 
and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
Additionally in September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements ("SAB 108"), which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. For transition purposes, the registrants will be permitted to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The impact of adopting SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements. EITF 00-19-2 addresses an issuer's accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The guidance in EITF 00-19-2 amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, and FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"), to include scope exceptions for registration payment arrangements. EITF 00-19-2 further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment arrangement. EITF 00-19-2 shall be effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to the date of issuance of this EITF, or for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 00-19-2 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The following table presents the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2006, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company's reporting currency. The instruments actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, as indicated by geographic description ($USD equivalent in millions).
 
 
 
Based on the Company's variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by approximately $3.0 million in 2006 if short-term interest rates were 1.0% higher.
 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had Canadian investments totaling approximately CAD $801.3 million (approximately USD $687.2 million) comprised of real estate joint
venture investments and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of approximately MXP 5.0 billion (approximately USD $463.2 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt, inflation adjusted leases, and a cross currency swap (the "CC Swap"). The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the CC Swap. The Company believes it has mitigated its credit risk by entering into the CC Swap with a major financial institution.
 
25
 
 
The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Kimco Realty Corporation:
 
We have completed integrated audits of Kimco Realty Corporation's consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
 
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Internal control over financial reporting
 
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
 
 
Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company" or "Kimco"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers which are anchored generally by discount department stores, supermarkets or drugstores. The Company also provides property management services for shopping centers owned by affiliated entities, various real estate joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties.
 
Additionally, in connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI") subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions.
 
The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2006, the Company's single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 1.6% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues and only 0.8% of the Company's total shopping center gross leasable area ("GLA"). At December 31, 2006, the Company's five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl's and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.5%, 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.
 
The principal business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is the ownership, development, management and operation of retail shopping centers, including complementary services that capitalize on the Company's established retail real estate expertise. The Company does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Principles of Consolidation and Estimates
 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE") in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46(R)") or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate, depreciable lives, revenue recognition, the collectability of trade accounts receivable and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Minority Interests
 
Minority interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of FIN 46(R).
 
Minority interests also include partnership units issued from consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions. These units have a stated redemption value or a redemption amount based upon the Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock") and provide the unit holders various rates of return during the holding period. The unit holders generally have the right to redeem their units for cash at any time after one year from issuance. The Company typically has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or Common Stock for the issuance of convertible units. The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, and EITF D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, to determine if the units are mandatorily redeemable, and as such accounts for them accordingly.
 
 
Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. If there is an event or a change in circumstances that indicates that the basis of a property (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable, then management will assess any impairment in value by making a comparison of (i) the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life and (ii) the net carrying amount of the property. If the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
 
37
 
 
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
 
When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
 
Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"), at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the initial purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. As final information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. The allocations are finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date.
 
The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property "as-if-vacant". The fair value reflects the depreciated replacement cost of the permanent assets, with no trade fixtures included.
 
In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases and management's estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions (i.e., expense recapture, base rental changes, etc.) measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases. Mortgage debt premiums are amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument. Unit discounts and premiums are amortized into Minority interest in income, net over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the units.
 
In determining the value of in-place leases, management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related costs based on current market demand. In estimating the value of tenant relationships, management considers the nature and extent of the existing tenant relationship, the expectation of lease renewals, growth prospects, and tenant credit quality, among other factors. The value assigned to in-place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the estimated remaining term of the leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, all unamortized costs relating to that lease would be written off.
 
 
 
 
38
 
 
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
 
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
 
 
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life.
 
 
Real estate under development represents both the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These properties are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in management's opinion, the net sales price of assets held for resale or the current and projected undiscounted cash flows of these assets to be held as long-term investments is less than the net carrying value, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
 
 
The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investment's net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.
 
The Company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Company's exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment; and due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments.
 
 
 
39
 
 
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
 
On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment.
 
 
Other real estate investments primarily consist of preferred equity investments for which the Company provides capital to developers and owners of real estate. The Company typically accounts for its preferred equity investments on the equity method of accounting, whereby earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and based upon an allocation of the investment's net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.
 
Mortgages and Other Financing Receivables
 
Mortgages and other financing receivables consist of loans acquired and loans originated by the Company. Loan receivables are recorded at stated principal amounts net of any discount or premium or deferred loan origination costs or fees. The related discounts or premiums on mortgages and other loans purchased are amortized or accreted over the life of the related loan receivable. The Company defers certain loan origination and commitment fees, net of certain origination costs, and amortizes them as an adjustment of the loan's yield over the term of the related loan. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal on each loan to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of loss is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or to the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateralized. Interest income on performing loans is accrued as earned. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis.
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents (demand deposits in banks, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less) includes tenants' security deposits, escrowed funds and other restricted deposits approximating $0.6 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at a limited number of banks and financial institutions, exceed insurable amounts. The Company believes it mitigates its risks by investing in or through major financial institutions. Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuers.
 
 
The Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders' equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.
 
40
 
 
KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
 
All debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
 
 
Costs incurred in obtaining tenant leases and long-term financing, included in deferred charges and prepaid expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized over the terms of the related leases or debt agreements, as applicable. Such capitalized costs include salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved in successful leasing efforts.
 
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
 
Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned.
 
Management and other fee income consist of property management fees, leasing fees, property acquisition and disposition fees, development fees and asset management fees. These fees arise from contractual agreements with third parties or with entities in which the Company has a partial non-controlling interest. Management and other fee income, including acquisition and disposition fees, are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. Management and other fee income related to partially owned entities is recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated interest.
 
Gains and losses from the sale of depreciated operating property and ground-up development projects are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate ("SFAS No. 66"), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of sale and subsequent involvement by the Company with the properties are met.
 
Gains and losses on transfers of operating properties result from the sale of a partial interest in properties to unconsolidated joint ventures and are recognized using the partial sale provisions of SFAS No. 66.
 
The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company's reported net income is directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.

Income Taxes
 
The Company has made an election to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under Section 856 through 860 of the Code.
 
In connection with the RMA, which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in certain activities which it was previously precluded from in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. As such, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities.
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
 
 
Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in OCI, as a separate component of the Company's stockholders' equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effect of the transaction's gain or loss is included in the caption Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
 
The Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the Company's rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. In addition, the fair value adjustments will be recorded in either stockholders' equity or earnings in the current period based on the designation of the derivative. The effective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency hedges that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation component of OCI to the extent they are economically effective and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged investments are sold or otherwise disposed of. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of hedges are recorded in earnings for the current period.
 
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market fluctuations on equity securities. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into financial

instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Additionally, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions. The principal financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow, fair value or foreign currency hedges (see Note 16).
 
 
On July 21, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split (the "Stock Split") of the Company's common stock which was effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on August 23, 2005, to stockholders of record on August 8, 2005. All share and per share data included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect this Stock Split.
 
The following table sets forth the reconciliation of earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data):

(a) The effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.
 
In addition, there were approximately 71,250, 2,195,400 and 1,648,750 stock options that were anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Stock Compensation
 
The Company maintains an equity participation plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which a maximum of 42,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued for qualified and non-qualified options and restricted stock grants. Options granted under the Plan generally vest ratably over a three or five year term, expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. Restricted stock grants generally vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the grant. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting of certain options to each of the Company's non-employee directors (the "Independent Directors") and permits such Independent Directors to elect to receive deferred stock awards in lieu of directors' fees.
 
Prior to January 1, 2003, the Company accounted for the Plan under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25). Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("SFAS No. 148"), which applies the recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123") to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003.
 
During December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Opinion 25. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro-forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2005. The Company began expensing stock based employee compensation with its adoption of the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, effective January 1, 2003, as a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
The non-cash expense related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. There was no difference in amounts for the year ended December 31, 2006. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding stock awards in each period (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data):

The pro forma adjustments to net income and net income per diluted common share assume fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The more significant assumptions underlying the determination of such fair values for options granted during the year ended December 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FIN 48"), regarding accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. This guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the provisions of FIN 48, but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
Additionally in September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements ("SAB 108"), which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. For transition purposes, the registrants will be permitted to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The impact of adopting SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements. EITF 00-19-2 addresses and issuer's accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The guidance in EITF 00-19-2 amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, and FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"), to include scope exceptions for registration payment arrangements. EITF 00-19-2 further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment arrangement. EITF 00-19-2 shall be effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to the date of issuance of this EITF, or for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 00-19-2 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Kimsouth -
 
During November 2002, the Company through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc. ("Kimsouth"). In connection with the merger, the Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Company's investment strategy with respect to Kimsouth included re-tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. As of January 1, 2006, Kimsouth consisted of five properties.
 
During May 2006, the Company acquired an additional 48% interest in Kimsouth for approximately $22.9 million, which increased the Company's total ownership to 92.5%. As a result of this transaction, the Company became the controlling shareholder and has therefore, commenced consolidation of Kimsouth upon the closing date. The acquisition of the additional 48% ownership interest has been accounted for as a step acquisition with the purchase price being allocated to the identified assets and liabilities of Kimsouth.
 
As of May 12, 2006, Kimsouth had approximately $133.0 million of net operating loss carry-forwards ("NOLs"), which may be utilized to offset future taxable income of Kimsouth. The Company evaluated the need for a valuation allowance based on projected taxable income and determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $34.2 million was required. As such, a purchase price adjustment of $17.5 million was recorded (see Note 22 for additional information).
 
During June 2006, Kimsouth contributed approximately $51.0 million, of which $47.2 million or 92.5% was provided by the Company, to fund its 15% non-controlling interest in a newly formed joint venture with an investment group to acquire a portion of Albertson's Inc. To maximize investment returns, the investment group's strategy with respect to this joint venture, includes refinancing, selling selected stores and the enhancement of operations at the remaining stores.

FNC Realty Corporation -
 
On July 27, 2005, Frank's Nursery and Crafts, Inc. ("Frank's") emerged from bankruptcy protection pursuant to a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization as FNC Realty Corporation ("FNC"). Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, the Company received common shares of FNC representing an approximate 27% ownership interest in exchange for its interest in Frank's. In addition, the Company acquired an additional 24.5% interest in the common shares of FNC for cash of approximately $17.0 million, thereby increasing the Company's ownership interest to approximately 51%. The Company also acquired approximately $42.0 million of fixed rate 7% convertible senior notes issued by FNC. As a result of the increase in ownership interest from 27% to 51%, the Company became the controlling shareholder and therefore, commenced consolidation of FNC effective July 27, 2005.
 
As of July 27, 2005, FNC had approximately $154.0 million of NOLs, which may be utilized to offset future taxable income of FNC. As Frank's had recurring losses and was in bankruptcy, the realization of the NOLs was uncertain. Accordingly a full valuation allowance was previously recorded against the deferred tax asset relating to these NOLs. Of the total amount of available NOLs, the Company has estimated approximately $124.0 million is unrestricted and $30.0 million is restricted (limited to utilization of $1.1 million per year).
 
The Company has evaluated the level of valuation allowance required and determined, based upon the expected investment strategy for FNC, that approximately $27.0 million of the allowance should be reduced and recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price. (See Note 22 for additional information.)
 
As of July 27, 2005, FNC held interests in 55 properties with approximately $16.1 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering 16 of the properties. These loans bore interest at fixed rates ranging from 4.00% to 7.75% and maturity dates ranging from June 2012 through June 2022. During December 2005, FNC pre-paid, without penalty, an aggregate $4.8 million of mortgage debt encumbering five of its properties. During 2006, FNC pre-paid, with a pre-payment penalty of approximately $1.2 million, an aggregate $7.0 million of mortgage debt encumbering six of its properties. The mortgage debt bore interest at a 7.75% fixed rate per annum and was scheduled to mature in August of 2014. As of December 31, 2006, FNC had approximately $2.1 million of non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering three properties. These remaining loans bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 7.00% to 7.31% and maturity dates ranging from June 2012 through June 2022.
 
The Company's investment strategy with respect to FNC includes re-tenanting, re-developing and disposition of the properties. From July 27, 2005, through December 31, 2005, FNC disposed of nine properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.4 million. During 2006, FNC disposed of an additional eight properties and one out-parcel, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $25.1 million. Additionally during 2006, FNC purchased one operating property adjacent to an existing property for $3.5 million.
 
JPG Self Storage -
 
During 2005, the Company acquired ten self-storage facilities through an existing joint venture in which the Company held an approximate 93.5% economic interest, for a purchase price of approximately $39.9 million including the assumption of approximately $7.5 million of non-recourse fixed-rate mortgage debt encumbering three of the properties. Upon completing this purchase, this entity owned 17 self-storage facilities located in various states. The joint venture had cross-collateralized 14 of these properties with approximately $44.0 million of non-recourse floating-rate

mortgage debt which was scheduled to mature in November 2007 and had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. Based upon the provisions of FIN 46(R), the Company had determined that this entity was a VIE. The Company had further determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of this VIE and had therefore consolidated this entity for financial reporting purposes. During November and December 2005, this entity disposed of, in separate transactions, four self-storage properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $18.6 million resulting in an aggregate gain of approximately $5.8 million. Proceeds from these sales were used to pay down approximately $9.8 million of mortgage debt and provided distributions to the partners. As a result of these transactions, the Company's economic interest had significantly decreased and the entity became subject to the reconsideration provisions of FIN 46(R). Based upon this reconsideration event and the provision of FIN 46(R), the Company determined that this entity was no longer a VIE and therefore deconsolidated this entity and accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting within the Company's Preferred Equity program.
 
These operating property acquisitions, development costs and other investments have been funded principally through the application of proceeds from the Company's public equity and unsecured debt issuances, proceeds from mortgage and construction financings, availability under the Company's revolving lines of credit and issuance of various partnership units.

During 2004, KDI sold, in separate transactions, five of its recently completed projects, three completed phases of projects and 29 out-parcels for approximately $170.2 million. These sales resulted in pre-tax gains of approximately $16.8 million.
 
5.
Adjustment of Property Carrying Values:
 
As part of the Company's periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Company's long-term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in December 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a book value of approximately $3.8 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.6 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon management's assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period for this investment. As a result, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million to reflect the property's estimated fair value. The Company's determination of estimated fair value was based upon third-party purchase offers less estimated closing costs. This property was subsequently sold during 2005 and this adjustment was included along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
6.
Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale:
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144") the Company reports as discontinued operations assets held-for-sale (as defined by SFAS No. 144) as of the end of the current period and assets sold subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 144. All results of these discontinued operations are included in a separate component of income on the Consolidated Statements of Income under the caption Discontinued operations. This has resulted in certain reclassifications of 2006, 2005 and 2004 financial statement amounts.
 
The components of Income from discontinued operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, are shown below. These include the results of operations for properties sold during the three months ended March 31, 2007, through

the date of each respective sale for properties sold during 2006, 2005 and 2004 and a full year of operations for those assets classified as held-for-sale as of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 (in thousands):
 
 
During 2006, the Company reclassified as held-for-sale 13 operating properties comprising 0.8 million square feet of GLA. The aggregate book value of these properties was approximately $36.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $5.9 million.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of its Canadian investments in real estate aggregating approximately CAD $5.2 million. During 2006, the Company settled its remaining CAD forward contracts. In addition, the Company had a cross currency interest rate swap with an aggregate notional amount of approximately MXP 82.4 million (approximately USD $7.6 million) designated as a hedge of its Mexican real estate investments at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
The Company has designated these foreign currency agreements as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in Canadian and Mexican real estate operations. These agreements are highly effective in reducing the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. As such, gains and losses on these net investment hedges were reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. During 2006 and 2005, respectively, $0.2 million and $0.7 million of unrealized losses and $0.3 and $3.2 million of unrealized gains were included in the cumulative translation adjustment relating to the Company's net investment hedges of its Canadian and Mexican investments.
 
During 2001, the Company acquired warrants to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock of a Canadian REIT. The Company designated the warrants as a cash flow hedge of the variability in expected future cash outflows upon purchasing the common stock. The change in fair value of the warrants representing unrealized gains was recorded in OCI. The net unrealized gains, since inception recorded in OCI as of December 31, 2004, were approximately $12.5 million. The Company exercised its warrants in October of 2004. During 2006, the Company sold 0.53 million shares of common stock of the Canadian REIT (2005: 0.2 million) resulting in a reclassification of $2.1 million of OCI balance to earnings as Other income, net (2005: $0.7 million).
 
The following tables summarize the notional values and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005:

The net proceeds from this sale of Common Stock, totaling approximately $405.5 million (after related transaction costs of $2.5 million) were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance under the Company's U.S. revolving credit facility, partial repayment of the outstanding balance under the Company's Canadian denominated credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
 
During March 2006, the shareholders of Atlantic Realty Trust ("Atlantic Realty") approved the proposed merger with the Company and the closing occurred on March 31, 2006.

During 2006, the Company acquired interests in seven shopping center properties located throughout Puerto Rico. The properties were acquired through the issuance of approximately $158.6 million of non-convertible units, approximately $45.8 million of convertible units, approximately $131.2 million of non-recourse debt and $116.3 million in cash.
 
The convertible units consist of (i) 2,627 Class B-1 Preferred Units, par value $10,000 per unit and 640,001 Class C DownREIT Units, valued at an issuance price of $30.52 per unit. Both the Class B-1 Units and the Class C DownREIT Units are redeemable by the holder at anytime after November 30, 2010 for cash or at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock.
 
The number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Class B-1 Preferred Units would be equal to the Class B-1 Cash Redemption Amount, as defined, which ranges from $6,000 to $14,000 per Class B-1 Preferred Unit depending on the Common Stock's Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, divided by the average daily market price for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the redemption date.
 
Prior to January 1, 2009, the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Class C DownREIT Units would be equal to the Class C Cash Amount which equals the number of Class C DownREIT Units being redeemed, multiplied by the Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined. After January 1, 2009, if the Adjusted Current Trading Price is greater than $36.62 then the Class C Cash Amount shall be an amount equal to the Adjusted Current Trading Price per Class C DownREIT Unit. If the Adjusted Current Trading Price is greater than $24.41 but less than $36.62, then the Class C Cash Amount shall be an amount equal to $30.51 per Class C DownREIT Unit; or is less than $24.41, then the Class C Cash Amount shall be an amount per Class C DownREIT Unit equal to the Adjusted Current Trading Price Multiplied by 1.25.
 
During April 2006, the Company acquired interests in two shopping center properties, located in Bay Shore and Centereach, NY, valued at an aggregate $61.6 million. The properties were acquired through the issuance of units from a consolidated subsidiary and consist of approximately $24.2 million of Redeemable Units, which are redeemable at the option of the holder, approximately $14.0 million of fixed rate Redeemable Units and the assumption of approximately $23.4 million of non-recourse mortgage debt.

During June 2006, the Company acquired an interest in an office property, located in Albany, NY, valued at approximately $39.9 million. The property was acquired through the issuance of approximately $5.0 million of redeemable units from a consolidated subsidiary, which are redeemable at the option of the holder after one year, and the assumption of approximately $34.9 million of non-recourse mortgage debt. The Company has the option to settle the redemption with Common Stock, at a ratio of 1:1, or cash.
 
During June 2003, the Company issued 7,000,000 Depositary Shares (the "Class F Depositary Shares"), each such Class F Depositary Share representing a one-tenth fractional interest of a share of the Company's 6.65% Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class F Preferred Stock"). Dividends

on the Class F Depositary Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears at the rate of 6.65% per annum based on the $25.00 per share initial offering price, or $1.6625 per annum. The Class F Depositary Shares are redeemable, in whole or part, for cash on or after June 5, 2008, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Depositary Share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. The Class F Depositary Shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Company.
 
Voting Rights - As to any matter on which the Class F Preferred Stock, ("Preferred Stock") may vote, including any action by written consent, each share of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to 10 votes, each of which 10 votes may be directed separately by the holder thereof. With respect to each share of Preferred Stock, the holder thereof may designate up to 10 proxies, with each such proxy having the right to vote a whole number of votes (totaling 10 votes per share of Preferred Stock). As a result, each Class F Depositary Share is entitled to one vote.
 
Liquidation Rights - In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, the Preferred Stock holders are entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its stockholders, a liquidation preference of $250.00 per share ($25.00 per Class F Depositary Share), plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of the Company's common stock or any other capital stock that ranks junior to the Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights.
 
During October 2002, the Company acquired an interest in a shopping center property located in Daly City, CA, valued at $80.0 million, through the issuance of approximately 4.8 million Convertible Units which are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the Company's common stock. The unit holder has the right to convert the Convertible Units at any time after one year. In addition, the Company has the right to mandatorily require a conversion after ten years. If at the time of conversion the common stock price for the 20 previous trading days is less than $16.785 per share, the unit holder would be entitled to additional shares; however, the maximum number of additional shares is limited to 503,932 based upon a floor Common Stock price of $15.180. The Company has the option to settle the conversion in cash. Dividends on the Convertible Units are paid quarterly at the rate of the Company's common stock dividend multiplied by 1.1057.

In December 2004, in conjunction with the Price Legacy transaction, the Company, which holds a 15% non-controlling interest, provided the acquiring joint venture approximately $30.6 million of secured mezzanine financing. This interest-only loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% per annum payable monthly in arrears and was scheduled to mature in December 2006. The Company also provided PL Retail a secured short-term promissory note for approximately $8.2 million. This interest only note bore interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% and was scheduled to mature in June 2005. During 2005, this note was amended to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% and is payable on demand. During 2006, PL Retail fully repaid the Company the mezzanine financing and the promissory note.

Commitments and Contingencies:
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operation of shopping centers which are either owned or held under long-term leases which expire at various dates through 2087. The Company and its subsidiaries, in turn, lease premises in these centers to tenants pursuant to lease agreements which provide for terms ranging generally from 5 to 25 years and for annual minimum rentals plus incremental rents based on operating expense levels and tenants' sales volumes. Annual minimum rentals plus incremental rents based on operating expense levels comprised approximately 99% of total revenues from rental property for each of the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
 
The future minimum revenues from rental property under the terms of all non-cancellable tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases are executed for such premises, for future years are approximately as follows (in millions): 2007, $436.5; 2008, $401.7; 2009, $363.5; 2010, $321.3; 2011, $276.5 and thereafter, $1,461.5.
 
Minimum rental payments under the terms of all non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to the Company's shopping center portfolio for future years are approximately as follows (in millions): 2007, $14.9; 2008, $14.8; 2009, $14.2; 2010, $12.4; 2011, $10.1 and thereafter, $175.8.

banks and guaranteed by the joint venture partners described below and the Company, the issuance of 9,185,847 shares of Common Stock valued at approximately $407.7 million, which was based upon the average closing price of Common Stock over the ten trading days immediately preceding the closing date, the assumption of approximately $630.0 million of unsecured bonds and approximately $289.4 million of existing non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering 23 properties and approximately $300.0 million in cash. With respect to the $1.2 billion guarantee by the Company, PREI, as defined below, guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. The Company evaluated this guarantee in connection with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and determined that the impact did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
Immediately following the merger, the Company commenced its joint venture agreements with Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI") through three separate accounts managed by PREI. In accordance with the joint venture agreements, all Pan Pacific assets and the respective non-recourse mortgage debt and the $1.2 billion credit facility mentioned above were transferred to the separate accounts. PREI contributed approximately $1.1 billion on behalf of institutional investors in three of its portfolios. The Company holds 15% non-controlling ownership interests in each of these joint ventures, collectively KimPru, with a total aggregate investment of approximately $194.8 million, and will account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. In addition, the Company will manage the portfolios and earn acquisition fees, leasing commissions, property management fees and construction management fees.
 
During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a non-recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $40.0 million (approximately USD $35.8 million) outstanding on this construction loan.
 
Additionally, during 2006, KROP obtained a one-year $15.0 million unsecured term loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.5%. This loan is guaranteed by the Company and GECRE has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 80% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make.
 
The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Company's ground-up development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.9 million.
 
In connection with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately $92.5 million bonds outstanding.
 
Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $6.0 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $3.9 million (approximately USD $3.4 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2006, relating to various development projects.

During 2005, a joint venture entity in which the Company has a non-controlling interest obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD $19.3 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in May 2007. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $6.4 million) related to this facility. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $21.0 million (approximately USD $18.0 million) outstanding on this facility.
 
Additionally, during 2005, the Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint ventures in which the Company holds 50% non-controlling interests. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four one year term loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%. During 2006, these term loans were extended for an additional year. These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner.
 
During 2005, PL Retail entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.675% and was scheduled to mature in February 2007. During 2007, the loan was extended to February 2008 at a reduced rate of LIBOR plus 0.45%. This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2006, there was $39.5 million outstanding under this facility.
 
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
 
21.
Incentive Plans:
 
The Company maintains a stock option plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which a maximum of 42,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued for qualified and non-qualified options. Options granted under the Plan generally vest ratably over a three or five-year term, expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, unless otherwise determined by the Board at its sole discretion. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting of certain options to each of the Company's non-employee directors (the "Independent Directors") and permits such Independent Directors to elect to receive deferred stock awards in lieu of directors' fees.
 
During December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Opinion 25. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro-forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2005. The Company began expensing stock based employee compensation with its adoption of the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, effective January 1, 2003, as a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

The exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2006, range from $9.46 to $46.88 per share. The weighted-average remaining contractual life for options outstanding as of December 31, 2006, was approximately 7.3 years. Options to purchase 5,969,396, 3,817,066, and 6,332,266 shares of the Company's common stock were available for issuance under the Plan at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Cash received from options exercised under the Plan was approximately $39.1 million, $42.2 million and $46.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $42.2 million, $46.2 million, and $36.2 million, respectively.
 
The Company recognized stock options expense of $10.2 million, $4.6 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $25.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock compensation granted under the Company's Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.7 years.
 
The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all officers and employees, which permits participants to defer up to the maximum allowable amount determined by the Internal Revenue Service of their eligible compensation. This deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions, which generally equal employee deferrals up to a maximum of 5% of their eligible compensation (capped at $170,000), is fully vested and funded as of December 31, 2006. The Company contributions to the plan were approximately $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
22.
Income Taxes:
 
The Company elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with the Code commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted REIT taxable income to its stockholders. It is management's intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the Company's REIT status. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under the Code. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries ("TRS"):
 
The Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its TRS activities, which include Kimco Realty Services ("KRS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the consolidated entities of FNC, Kimsouth and Blue Ridge Real Estate Company/Big Boulder Corporation.
 
Income taxes have been provided for on the asset and liability method as required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the TRS assets and liabilities.
 
The Company's taxable income for book purposes and provision for income taxes relating to the Company's TRS and taxable entities which have been consolidated for accounting reporting purposes, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are included in the caption Other assets and Other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Operating losses and the valuation allowance are due to the Company's consolidation of FNC and Kimsouth for accounting and reporting purposes. At December 31, 2006, FNC had approximately $138.4 million of net operating loss carry forwards that expire from 2022 through 2025, with a tax value of approximately $54.0 million. A valuation allowance of $33.8 million has been established for a portion of these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006, Kimsouth had approximately $111.1 million of net operating loss carrying forwards that expire from 2021 to 2023, with a tax value of approximately $43.3 million. A valuation allowance for $34.2 million has been established for a portion of these deferred tax assets. Other deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences in the timing of the recognition of income/(loss) between the GAAP and tax basis of accounting for (i) real estate joint ventures, (ii) other real estate investments and (iii) other deductible temporary differences. The Company believes that, based on its operating strategy and consistent history of profitability, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of $38.0 million will be realized on future tax returns, primarily from the generation of future taxable income.
