) between the Company and a warrant agent (the
Warrant Agent
). Each series of Preferred Shares may vary as to the specific number of shares, title, stated value, liquidation preference, issuance price, ranking, dividend rate or rates (or method of calculation), dividend payment dates, any redemption or sinking fund requirements, any conversion provisions and any other variable terms as set forth in the applicable articles supplementary (each, the

Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Securities through you or through an underwriting syndicate managed by you, the Company will enter into an agreement (the
Terms Agreement
) providing for the sale of such Securities (the
Underwritten Securities
) to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, you and such other underwriters, if any, selected by you as have authorized you to enter into such Terms Agreement on their behalf (the
Underwriters
,
which term shall include you whether acting alone in the sale of the Underwritten Securities or as a member of an underwriting syndicate and any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Underwritten Securities shall specify the number of Underwritten Securities of each class or series to be initially issued, including the number of Common Stock Warrants, if any (the
Initial Underwritten Securities
), whether the Initial Underwritten Securities shall be in the form of Depositary Shares and the fractional amount of Preferred Shares represented by each Depositary Share, the names of the Underwriters participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof), the number of Initial Underwritten Securities which each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, the names of such of you or such other Underwriters acting as co-managers, if any, in connection with such offering, the price at which the Initial Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, if any, of the Initial Underwritten Securities, the Applicable Time (as defined below), any and all Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below), the time, date and place of delivery and payment, any delayed delivery arrangements and any other variable terms of the Initial Underwritten Securities (including, but not limited to, current ratings (in the case of Preferred Shares and Depositary Shares only), designations, liquidation preferences, conversion provisions, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements and the terms of the Warrant Securities and the terms, prices and dates upon which such Warrant Securities may be purchased). In addition, each Terms Agreement shall specify whether the Company has agreed to grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase additional Underwritten Securities to cover over-allotments, if any, and the number of Underwritten Securities subject to such option (the

Commission
) an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-133908), including the related base prospectus, for the registration of the Securities and Warrant Securities and certain of the Companys debt securities, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (

Rule 430B Information
. Each prospectus, if any, used in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, is herein called a

The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the 
Original Registration Statement.
 The base prospectus and final prospectus supplement, in the form first furnished or made available to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at the time of the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement, is herein called the

Closing Time

The Underwritten Securities, which may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by you on or before the first business day prior to the Closing Time or the Date of Delivery, as the case may be.
If authorized by the applicable Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Underwritten Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts (

As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to you at Closing Time, for the respective accounts of the Underwriters, a fee specified in the applicable Terms Agreement for each of the Underwritten Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at the Closing Time as is specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types described in the Prospectus. At the Closing Time, the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum number of Underwritten Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the applicable Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate number of Underwritten Securities in excess of that specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
You shall submit to the Company, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the number of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the Company will advise you, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, of the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the number of Underwritten Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract.
The number of Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by the several Underwriters pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be reduced by the number of Underwritten Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by you to the Company;
provided
,
however

(i)           
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii)          
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission referred to in subsection (i) above, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company;
(iii)         
against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by you), as incurred, which was reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
33
 
 
provided
,
however
, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(b)          
Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
(c)          
Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereunder in connection with such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation,
34
 
 
proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 7.           
Contribution
. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the offering of the Underwritten Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the Underwriters in respect of such offering, as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement in respect of such offering bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities purchased by it pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses. The Underwriters obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of the Initial Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement and not joint.
Section 8.           
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, or investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.
Section 9.           
Termination of Agreement
. (a) This Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Company or by you upon the giving of 30 days written notice of such termination to the other party hereto.
 
35
 
 
(b)          
You may also terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the applicable Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, the effect of which is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (iii) trading in any of the securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the FINRA or any other governmental authority, or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by Federal, New York or Maryland authorities, or (iv) there has occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services, or (v) Preferred Shares or Depositary Shares are being offered and the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any preferred stock of the Company, including such Preferred Shares or Depositary Shares, as the case may be, as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement shall have been lowered or withdrawn since such date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has any preferred stock of the Company under surveillance or review.
(c)          
In the event of any such termination, (x) the covenants set forth in Section 3 with respect to any offering of Underwritten Securities shall remain in effect so long as any Underwriter owns any such Underwritten Securities purchased from the Company pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and (y) the covenant set forth in Section 3(g) hereof, the provisions of Section 4 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 8 and 15 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Section 10.         
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the applicable Closing Time to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the
Defaulted Securities
), then you shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, you shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
(a)          
if the total number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the total number of Underwritten Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters named in such Terms Agreement shall be obligated, severally and
36
 
 
not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b)          
if the total number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the total number of Underwritten Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default under this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term Underwriter includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.
Section 12.

No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship
. The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement and this Agreement, including the determination of the price for the Underwritten Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arms-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter or several Underwriters, on the other hand; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Company or any of its affiliates; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed any advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or any of its affiliates with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or any of its affiliates on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or any of its affiliates with respect to any offering of Underwritten Securities except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement; (iv) each Underwriter and its affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company; and (v) no Underwriter has provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
37
 
 
Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement, and the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
This Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement supersede all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriter or several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriter or several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
