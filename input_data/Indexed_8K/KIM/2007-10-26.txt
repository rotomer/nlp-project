Exhibit 99.1 Kimco Realty Corporation Reports Third Quarter Earnings NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2007--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) reported results for the quarter ending September 30, 2007. Net income available to common shareholders was $75.1 million for the third quarter of 2007 or $0.29 per diluted share compared to $88.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006. Year-to-date, net income per diluted share was up 15.1 percent to $1.37 from $1.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2006. Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, was $146.6 million for the third quarter 2007, an increase of 5.8 percent from $138.6 million in the same period a year ago. Funds from operations per diluted share were up 1.8 percent to $0.57 for the third quarter of 2007 from $0.56 in the third quarter of 2006. Year-to date, FFO per diluted share grew 26.4 percent to $2.06 from $1.63 for the same period in 2006. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the attached tables. Highlights for the third quarter 2007: -- Achieved growth in same-store net operating income for the quarter of 4.2 percent; -- Posted a record high occupancy of 96.2 percent in the entire shopping center portfolio at the end of the third quarter, a 30 basis point increase sequentially and a 90 basis point increase from the same period a year ago; -- Grew year-to-date FFO per diluted share by 26.4 percent over the same period in 2006; -- Recognized $6.0 million of promoted income upon the sale of two assets from Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio (KROP) and other distributions from KROP during the quarter; -- Recognized $6.2 million, net of tax, from its investment in Albertson's; -- Issued $460 million of cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a yield of 7.75 percent; and -- Replaced the company's $850 million revolving credit facility with a new $1.5 billion, 4 year revolving credit facility, maturing October, 2011, at an interest rate reduction of 7.5 basis points. Capital Structure Subsequent to the quarter close, Kimco completed two strategic moves as part of its overall capital plan. With the goal of maximizing liquidity, the company completed a $460 million offering of 18,400,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100 fractional interest in a share of the company's 7.75% Class G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share. These depositary shares, priced at $25.00, entitle holders to a 7.75% cumulative dividend or $1.9375 per annum, are not convertible into common stock and are redeemable at par at the option of the company on and after October 10, 2012. In addition, the company expanded its U.S. line of credit to $1.5 billion from $850 million with an interest rate reduction of 7.5 basis points. These two transactions position the company well for future strategic acquisitions or initiatives. Portfolio Activity Kimco's shopping center portfolio includes 948 properties: 852 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 39 in Canada, 53 in Mexico and four in Chile. Same-store growth in net operating income was 4.2 percent for the quarter. Same-store growth has averaged 4.6 percent over the past eight quarters. During the quarter, the company celebrated the grand opening of the District at Tustin Legacy, a one million square foot lifestyle center being developed in partnership with Vestar Development Company in Tustin, Calif. The company has more than 55 active development and redevelopment projects for its own portfolio as well as approximately 30 merchant development projects. Total net cost for these projects is estimated at more than $2.0 billion at completion. Approximately 20 of the 55 projects for Kimco's own portfolio are located in Mexico. Mexico has historically been underserved by retail operators with only approximately 800 shopping centers compared to 48,000 in the U.S. As income levels rise, home financing becomes available and demographics in Mexico shift more toward urban areas, formal retail venues are increasingly in demand. Kimco is currently the largest owner of retail centers in Mexico and expects to continue investing vigorously in the country. Kimco continues to pursue innovative strategies to create shareholder value. The company is pursuing several new commingled funds which it expects to unveil in 2008. A U.S. Land Fund similar to the Mexico Land Fund will be introduced and used to purchase and hold land for future development in Arizona, California, Texas and Florida. An Urban Redevelopment Fund will target in-fill redevelopment opportunities in the New York City metro area. Finally, as Kimco expands geographically into South America, the company will partner with investors to own retail properties in countries such as Brazil, Chile and Peru. Shopping Center Portfolio For the quarter, the company signed a total of 430 leases totaling 1,151,000 square feet in its shopping center holdings: 227 new leases for 526,000 square feet and 203 lease renewals for 625,000 square feet. In the U.S. portfolio, Kimco signed 165 new leases for 483,000 square feet and 138 lease renewals for 491,000 square feet. On new leases signed for the same space in U.S., the average increase in contractual base rent was approximately 17.1 percent on a cash basis for the quarter. During the quarter the company acquired 15 properties. Acquisitions include the Birchwood portfolio with seven retail properties totaling 240,000 square feet on Long Island, N.Y., two power centers, one in Charlotte, N.C. and one in Corona Hills, Calif. and one shopping center in Mexico City, Mexico. The company also acquired one additional property in a joint venture during the quarter, which is leased to an auto dealership in Windsor, Canada. Kimco continues to expand its relationship with GE Real Estate in Mexico. During the quarter, Kimco sold a 50 percent interest in two development properties into its Mexican joint venture with GE Real Estate for US $17.2 million. Ciudad del Carmen, a 427,000 square foot shopping center located on Mexico's gulf coast just west of the Yucatan Peninsula, will be anchored by Home Depot, Chedraui grocery store, and a theater. Plaza Rosarito is a 600,000 square foot shopping center anchored by Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Cinepolis and is located on Mexico's pacific coast, south of Tijuana. This brings the total number of properties in the joint venture with GE Real Estate to 14 properties totaling approximately 5.0 million square feet. In August, the company purchased land for approximately US $16.9 million for a 455,000 square foot retail development located in Tijuana, Mexico. The center, which will be anchored by Wal-Mart and Cinepolis, is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2008 and will cost approximately $34 million. The Mexico Land and Development Fund, a joint venture managed by Kimco, added a second site to its portfolio during the quarter with the acquisition of a 22 acre land parcel in Apodaca, Mexico just outside Monterrey for approximately US $5.3 million. Two new sites, located in Monterrey and Torreon, were also approved. The land will be held for future development or sale. The company also acquired eight new industrial properties in Mexico with its joint venture partner American Industries totaling approximately 202,000 square feet. The properties, located in various cities in Mexico, were purchased for US $17.4 million. Kimco Investment Management Programs Fees from Kimco's investment management business increased to $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $9.8 million in the third quarter 2006, including $10.3 million in management fees, $1.9 million in disposition and other transaction-based fees and $0.5 million in other ongoing fees and excluding promoted income. Kimco Developers (KDI) Kimco Developers, Inc. sold Phase II of Gateway Station Plaza, an 80,000 square foot shopping center in Burleson, Texas for $18.6 million. KDI also sold Gilbert Esplanade, 68 acres of undeveloped land located in Arizona which was previously held for development, for $37.8 million. Kimco Capital Services Preferred Equity Investments Kimco currently has approximately $465 million invested in 261 properties in its preferred equity program, 160 properties in the U.S. and 101 properties in Canada. During the quarter, the company recognized a total of $11.4 million of income, net of tax, from preferred equity investments including $1.1 million in residual profit participation. The company acquired eight new preferred equity investments in the U.S. totaling $17.7 million during the quarter and eight in Canada for US $19.4 million. Retailer Services & Kimco Select (KSI) Retailer Services, Kimco's business which provides capital to retailers and other enterprises with significant real estate holdings and Kimco Select, which invests opportunistically with select operating partners, recognized income of $31 million during the quarter. Income from Retailer Services included approximately $3.0 million in recurring income as well as $6.2 million resulting from the company's investment in Albertsons. Kimco Select realized approximately $22 million during the quarter including a total of $10 million in recurring income. Recurring income included $5.8 million from a partial quarter from its investment in InTown Suites and the portfolio of net leased properties. KSI also realized $10.6 million in gains from the sale of marketable securities. Portfolio Overview As of September 2007, Kimco owned equity interests in 1,959 properties in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Chile totaling 183 million square feet as follows: 409 consolidated shopping centers, 354 shopping centers in investment management programs and 126 other joint venture shopping centers, 59 development properties that together total 948 centers and 145 million square feet.

Funds From Operations would be increased by $2,635 and $2,544 for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively and $7,434 and $6,733 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pursuant to the definition of Funds from Operations ("FFO") adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains from sales of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Given the nature of the Company's business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of its operational performance and FFO is a widely recognized measure in the Company's industry. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the comparability of the Company's FFO with the FFO reported by other REITs may be affected by the differences that exist regarding certain accounting policies relating to expenditures for repairs and other recurring items.
