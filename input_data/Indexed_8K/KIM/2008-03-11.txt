During 2007, Kimco Realty Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") acquired in separate transactions, 56 operating properties (referred to herein as the "Acquisition Properties"), which qualify for the aggregate audit requirements under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X ("Rule 3-14").  The Acquisition Properties comprise an aggregate of approximately 4.2 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), and had an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994.2 million including the assumption of approximately $95.6 million of non-recourse debt encumbering eight of the properties.  The aggregate purchase price of the properties exceeded 10% of the total assets of the Company as of December 31, 2007.  None of these acquisition transactions constitute a "significant subsidiary".
Details of the acquisitions are as follows (in thousands):
* Properties were selected for audit under Rule 3-14 ("Selected Acquisition Properties").  The aggregate purchase price of the Selected Acquisition Properties was approximately $547.1 million or approximately 55.0% of the aggregate purchase price of the Acquisition Properties.
(A)  Properties purchased from a related party, the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture in which the Company has a 20% non-controlling ownership interest, ("KROP Acquisitions"), therefore requiring audits for three years under Rule 3-14.
(B)  Properties purchased from a related party, the Kimco Prudential Joint Ventures ("KimPru"), joint ventures in which the Company has 15% non-controlling ownership interests, ("PNP Acquisitions"), therefore requiring audits for three years under Rule 3-14.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to the purchase price and financial statements of property acquisitions, which are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.  The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur.  You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases.  You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.  Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements.  We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in real estate and zoning laws, risks related to doing business internationally and increases in real property tax rates.  Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Business Risks" and elsewhere in our most recent annual report for the year ended December 31, 2007 Form 10-K.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kimco Realty Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses of Park Place, Wayne Plaza, and Center at Westbank (the "KROP Acquisitions") for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.  These Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses are the responsibility of KROP Acquisitions' management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and  regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange  Commission (for inclusion in the Form 8-K of Kimco Realty Corporation) as described in Note 1 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the properties' revenues and expenses.
In our opinion, the Combined Statements of Revenues and Certain Expenses referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses described in Note 1 of KROP Acquisitions for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases.  Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee.  These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved.  Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements.  In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.  Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned.
Property Operating Expenses
Property operating expenses represent the direct expenses of operating the Portfolio and include maintenance, utilities, and repair costs that are expected to continue in the ongoing operations of the properties. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Combined Statement in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and certain expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.
3. Commitments
The KROP Acquisitions lease premises to tenants pursuant to lease agreements, which provide for terms ranging from one to 34 years. The future minimum revenues from rental properties under the terms of all non-cancellable tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases are executed for such premises, for the future years are approximately as follows (in thousands):
