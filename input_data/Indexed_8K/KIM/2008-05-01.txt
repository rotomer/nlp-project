With portfolio occupancy at historically high levels, Kimco has placed even greater emphasis on potential redevelopment initiatives.

Yields on these projects range from 10 to 13 percent. Kimco currently has more than 20 projects totaling approximately $325 million under redevelopment including Cupertino Village in Cupertino, Calif., Plaza del Sol in Phoenix, Ariz. and Cottman & Bustleton Center in Pennsylvania. At Cupertino Village, Kimco plans to add approximately 25,000 square feet of retail space, structured parking and outdoor plaza areas to the center, which is located in a dense, high-income submarket of the San Francisco Peninsula with diverse ethnic demographics and a strong Asian community. The renovation of Plaza del Sol is nearing completion and includes a remerchandising strategy that introduced several Hispanic oriented tenants to the submarket and has achieved significant occupancy increases due to the redevelopment plan. Longer term projects include Marketplace at Factoria in Bellevue, Wash. and Cottman & Bustleton in Philadelphia where Kimco is repositioning aged infrastructure with high-density new developments for increased retail gross leasable area from credit national tenants. Both projects have completed lengthy entitlement efforts and are in the execution phase of the project master plan.
