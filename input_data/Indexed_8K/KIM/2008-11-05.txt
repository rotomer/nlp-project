Capital Structure and Dividend
As previously announced, the company completed an equity offering of 11.5 million shares of common stock priced at $37.10 which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $410.0 million during the third quarter 2008. The proceeds were utilized to partially pay down the outstanding balance on its U.S. revolving credit facility.

These facilities have initial maturity dates in 2011, with one year extension options.
Since the end of June 2008, the company has successfully refinanced approximately $1 billion of maturing debt for its own account and various joint ventures. This includes a $650 million two year facility provided by a consortium of 18 banks for the joint venture with Prudential, $218.2 million of proceeds from 8 individual non-recourse mortgages for the Kimco Income REIT (KIR) joint venture with maturities of seven to ten years at rates ranging from 6.00 - 6.50 percent and $85 million in proceeds from three other non-recourse loans for individual joint ventures.

Portfolio Activity
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 888 operating properties: 800 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, 50 in Canada, 34 in Mexico and four in Chile as well as 54 development properties: 23 in the United States, 27 in Mexico, two in Chile and one each in Brazil and Peru. Same-store growth in net operating income in the U.S. portfolio was 2.6 percent for the quarter and has averaged 3.8 percent over the past eight quarters.
Although the company experienced a modest increase in vacancies during the quarter as some retailers struggled with the current economic conditions, the impact of these vacancies has been mitigated by strong demand for Kimcos centers as stable retail categories relocate or expand into older, mature and supply-constrained markets. The quarter's U.S. new lease total of 1.2 million square feet is substantially above the same quarter in the prior year and is facilitating the recapture of below-market leases allowing for the space to be rolled to current market rents. This base rental increase can be noted in the same-store new leasing spread of 17.3 percent for the quarter with continued low capital investment in the form of tenant allowances.
Tenant bankruptcies for the quarter have been a challenge as spaces recaptured from Goody's and Linens N Things are being marketed in an environment where few large scale retailers are aggressively expanding. Through the companys portfolio review process; however, several strong retail chains have expressed interest in these stable, mature markets where demographics are stable. In these cases, the new anchor vacancies allow a release of control on the overall site and provide an opportunity to reposition properties around new tenants with stronger sales potential and a more stable merchant mix.
For the quarter, the company signed a total of 481 leases totaling 1.4 million square feet in its shopping center holdings: 225 new leases for 0.6 million square feet and 256 lease renewals for 0.8 million square feet. In the U.S. portfolio, Kimco signed 186 new leases for 588,000 square feet and 201 lease renewals for 631,000 square feet. On new leases signed for the same space in U.S., the average increase in contractual base rent was approximately 17.3 percent on a cash basis for the quarter; including renewals and options the average increase in contractual base rent was 10.6 percent.
The company acquired two shopping centers during the quarter, one each in Canada and Chile. In Canada, Kimco acquired a 50 percent interest in Tacoma Plaza, a 187,000 square foot center anchored by Sobeys and Shoppers Drug Mart for approximately US $ 8.9 million. In Chile, the company acquired a 75 percent interest in a 26,000 square foot shopping center located in Santiago for approximately US $4.3 million. Kimco also acquired one additional industrial property in Mexico through its joint venture with American Industries.
Kimco disposed of five properties during the quarter totaling $26.8 million and realized gains of $8.8 million. Four shopping centers were sold from its consolidated portfolio, one each in Fla., NY and two in Ill. One additional property in Kan. was sold from KIR.
Kimco Investment Management Programs
Fees from Kimcos investment management business were $13.0 million in the third quarter of 2008 including $9.8 million in management fees, $1.9 million in other ongoing fees and $1.3 million in transaction based fees.
During the third quarter the company sold 14 properties to the newly established Kimco Income Fund II. Kimcos current ownership is 74 percent and the company continues to market the fund to other investors with targeted ownership of approximately 15 percent. The total sales price of the properties was $352 million including $231 million of mortgage debt. The portfolio, which totals approximately two million square feet, is approximately 95.8 percent occupied; three of the properties are located in Ga., four are in Calif., and the remainders are in various other states.
