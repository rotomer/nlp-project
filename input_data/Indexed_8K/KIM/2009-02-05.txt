NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 5, 2009--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2008.
Highlights for 2008 and Fourth Quarter 2008
Sourced approximately $1.8 billion in total new debt and equity;
Refinanced approximately $1.1 billion in maturing mortgages and unsecured debt;
Extended maturities of construction and other loans totaling $330 million;
Executed 1,844 leases totaling over 5.7 million square feet in 2008, representing increases of 12.3 percent and 9.5 percent on new and renewal leases signed over one year ago;
Declared regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share payable April 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on April 6, 2009;
Announced management promotions.
for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $63.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to net income available to common shareholders of $72.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007. The change in year-over-year net income is primarily related to additional impairment charges in 2008 of $113.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share resulting principally from the write-down in the fourth quarter of 2008 of securities investments and from the write-down of its equity investment in the companys unconsolidated joint ventures with Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI) sponsored real estate funds. For the full year 2008, net income available to common shareholders was $202.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $423.2 million or $1.65 per diluted share for the full year 2007.
Net loss to common shareholders
a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, was $10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $136.2 million for the same period one year ago. FFO per diluted share was $0.04 for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, FFO was $522.9 million compared to $669.8 million in 2007 and FFO per diluted share was $2.02 compared to $2.59 in 2007. Excluding additional impairment charges in 2008 over 2007 of $0.44 per diluted share, FFO per diluted share was $2.46 and $2.59 for 2008 and 2007, respectively. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Funds from operations (FFO),
For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $111.8 million and $121.4 million, net of tax, as well as $4 million related to charges for workforce reduction.
Approximately $83.1 million and $92.7 million of the total non-cash impairment charges for the quarter and the year, respectively, was due to the decline in value of certain marketable equity and other securities that were deemed to be other than temporary. The companys previous earnings guidance estimated these charges at approximately $50 million for the fourth quarter; however, the unprecedented deterioration of the equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a larger impairment than previously estimated.
Additionally, the company recognized non-cash impairments of $22.2 million, net to Kimco, against the carrying value of its investment in its unconsolidated joint ventures with PREI, reflecting an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in accordance with accounting principles. Also, impairments of approximately $6.5 million were recognized on real estate development projects including two of Kimcos development projects: Plantations Crossing and Miramar Town Center. Additionally, in connection with a reduction in force, the company recognized severance charges of approximately $4 million. None of these charges were previously reflected in the companys guidance.
Capital Structure and Dividend
For the year, Kimco sourced approximately $750 million in total debt and equity for its own balance sheet. During the third quarter, the company raised approximately $410 million from an equity offering of 11.5 million shares of common stock priced at $37.10. Additionally, approximately $340 million in unsecured facilities were obtained during the year.
Within its joint venture programs, Kimco raised more than $1 billion: $650 million in unsecured debt and approximately $385 million in secured debt. This includes a $650 million two-year facility provided by a consortium of 18 banks for the companys joint venture with PREI, $218 million of proceeds from eight individual non-recourse mortgages at rates ranging from 6.0 to 6.5 percent with maturities of seven to ten years for the Kimco Income REIT (KIR) joint venture, and $167 million in proceeds from eight other non-recourse loans for individual joint ventures. In addition, the company successfully completed the extensions of various construction loans and other maturing loans totaling $330 million. The company sourced these loans from various national and regional commercial banks and life insurance companies.
The company maintains access to approximately $1.0 billion of immediate liquidity under its $1.5 billion U.S. revolving credit facility and its CAD $250 million Canadian revolving credit facility. Both these facilities have initial maturity dates of 2011, with one-year extension options. Additionally, the company has 392 unencumbered properties on its balance sheet with capacity under its bond indenture and line-of-credit covenants of up to $1.3 billion in additional financing.
The companys current dividend is $0.44 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share, payable on April 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on April 6, 2009, representing an ex-dividend date of April 2, 2009. Management and the Board continue to evaluate the companys dividend policy on a quarterly basis as they monitor sources of capital and evaluate the impact of the economy on operating fundamentals.
Management Promotions
In November, Kimco announced the promotions of three executive officers. David B. Henry was appointed president of the company; Michael V. Pappagallo was appointed chief administrative officer in addition to his role as chief financial officer; David Lukes was appointed chief operating officer of the company, succeeding Michael J. Flynn. Mr. Flynn continues to work with Kimco in a consulting capacity and in an advisory role on the companys investment management committee. Milton Cooper continues to serve as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. Cooper will lead an expanded office of the chairman which includes the above named executives.
