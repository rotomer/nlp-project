Capital Structure and Dividend
Since the beginning of the year, the company obtained approximately $212 million in secured debt commitments for the consolidated portfolio. These commitments were sourced from five different lenders for the financing of six individual properties. These loans are expected to have maturities ranging from three to 15 years with interest rates ranging from 5.95% to 7.625%. In addition, the company has received term sheets for financing secured by 17 properties that are expected to generate proceeds of approximately $246 million.
Additionally in the first quarter of 2009, the company repaid $130 million of its medium term notes that bore interest at 6.875%.
In the joint venture programs, mortgage financing totaling $106 million for six properties were closed; term sheets totaling $211 million are under negotiation and extensions for $135 million were obtained.
Subsequent to quarter close, the company (i) completed an equity offering of 105.2 million shares of common stock priced at $7.10 which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $718.0 million, and (ii) closed on a new $220.0 million unsecured term loan with a consortium of 12 banks including one new bank. The loan, which bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (subject to a 2.00% LIBOR floor) plus 465 basis points, will mature in April 2011. Proceeds from these capital transactions were used to repay outstanding amounts under the companys unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility. As a result of these repayments, the company maintains access to approximately $1.6 billion of immediate liquidity under its U.S. revolving credit facility ($1.5 billion) and its Canadian revolving credit facility (CAD$250 million). These facilities have initial maturity dates in 2011, with one year extension options.
Recognizing the need to maintain maximum financial flexibility in light of the current state of the capital markets, and considering the dividend requirements for the increased number of shares outstanding, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share in line with previous guidance. The dividend is payable on July 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on July 6, 2009, representing an ex-dividend date of July 1, 2009. Including prior dividends paid of $0.44 each in January and April, dividends declared year-to-date total $0.94 per common share. The company expects to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2009, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, which would bring total dividends paid for 2009 to $1.00 per common share.
Strategic Re-Alignment
Kimcos vision is to be the premier owner and operator of retail shopping centers. This will entail a shift away from certain non-strategic assets that the company currently holds. These investments include non-retail preferred equity investments, marketable securities, mortgages on non-retail properties, several urban mixed-uses properties, as well as its joint venture investments from the former Kimco Select business. Kimcos core business operations will focus on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through equity investments in North America. The Company intends that the capital structure to support this business will be targeted at conservative levels with leverage ratios more in line with historical averages.
Core Business Operations
Shopping Center Portfolio
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 921 operating properties, comprised of 814 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 51 in Canada, 47 in Mexico and nine in Chile, as well as 21 development properties, consisting of five assets in the United States, 10 in Mexico and six in South America.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the company executed a total of 569 leases totaling 2.8 million square feet in its shopping center holdings. These comprised 202 new leases for 680,000 square feet and 367 lease renewals for 2.1 million square feet. Occupancy for the shopping center portfolio in its entirety was 92.6 percent and same-property NOI declined by 50 basis points from the same period last year.
In the U.S. portfolio, the company executed 477 leases in the first quarter, representing a 30 percent increase on a square foot basis from the first quarter of 2008. Kimco signed 161 new leases for 543,000 million square feet and 316 lease renewals for 2.1 million square feet. On new leases signed within the U.S. portfolio, the average increase in contractual base rent was approximately 10.6 percent on a cash basis for the quarter. Including renewals for the same space which averaged 3.5 percent, the average increase was 5.1 percent. Occupancy for the U.S. portfolio was 92.2 percent at March 31, 2009.
Kimcos U.S. shopping center portfolio is well diversified by tenants as well as geography. Home Depot, a BBB+/Baa1 credit rated by S&P and Moodys respectively, is the REITs single largest tenant and accounts for only 3.3 percent of the companys annualized base rent. Occupancy in the U.S. shopping center portfolio declined by 120 basis points in the first quarter due primarily to the bankruptcy and subsequent vacates of Circuit City and Value City totaling approximately 70 basis points. The companys leasing pipeline remains active with approximately 423 leases (176 new and 247 renewals) under negotiation.
Investment Management Programs
The company realized fee income of $9.9 million from its investment management business in the first quarter of 2009. This included $8.2 million in management fees, $0.5 million in transaction-based fees and $1.2 million in other ongoing fees and excluding promoted income.
At quarter-end, the company had a total of 337 properties in investment management funds with 14 institutional partners.

Kimco currently has approximately $532.0 million invested in 632 properties in its preferred equity program (which includes its net lease portfolio): 537 properties in the U.S. and 95 properties in Canada.
The company also provides loans to retailers, underwriting the value of the retailers underlying real estate as collateral. During the quarter, the company recognized approximately $4.0 million in recurring income and $2.0 million in transaction related income from these investments.
