Net loss to common shareholders
Before non-cash impairment charges, net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2009 was $30.0 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to $83.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008. Comparable results were impacted by a reduction of approximately $40 million in transaction-based income, $12 million in recurring income from the companys non-core investments and an increase in depreciation of approximately $5 million. These declines were partially offset by an increase in net operating income of $1.5 million and an aggregate reduction in interest expense and non-controlling interests of approximately $6 million.
During the second quarter, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling $176.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share: approximately $126 million or $0.34 per diluted share related to the companys non-core investment portfolio and its preferred equity investments, $42 million or $0.11 per diluted share related to the companys assets and joint venture with the Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI) sponsored funds and $8.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to one consolidated property and two unconsolidated joint venture development projects.
Year-to-date, net income available to common shareholders per diluted share before non-cash impairments was $0.18 compared to $0.67 year-to-date through June 30, 2008. Including non-cash impairments, year-to-date net loss per diluted share was ($0.37) compared to net income of $0.66 per diluted share for the same period in 2008.

Core Business Operations
Shopping Center Portfolio
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 915 operating properties, comprised of 808 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 51 in Canada, 47 in Mexico and nine in Chile, as well as 21 development properties, consisting of five assets in the United States, 10 in Mexico and six in South America.
Occupancy in the companys total shopping center portfolio was 92.1 percent at the end of the second quarter, a 50 basis point decline sequentially and a 350 basis point decline from the second quarter of 2008. The company executed a total of 490 leases totaling 1.7 million square feet: 193 new leases for 606,000 square feet and 297 lease renewals for 1.1 million square feet.
In the U.S. portfolio, occupancy was 91.8 percent at the end of the second quarter, a 40 basis point decline sequentially and a 370 basis point decline year-over-year. Same-property NOI on an aggregate basis declined 180 basis points over the second quarter of 2008. During the second quarter, the company executed 392 leases totaling 1.5 million square feet. Same space leases totaling 1.3 million square feet included 84 new leases for 308,000 square feet at a 17.5 percent spread from the prior rent and 255 leases for renewals and options totaling 1.0 million square feet at a 1.2 percent rent spread which together aggregate a 5.3 percent rent increase over the prior leases.
Kimcos U.S. shopping center portfolio is well diversified by tenants as well as geography. Home Depot, a BBB+/Baa1 credit rated by S&P and Moodys respectively, is the REIT's single largest tenant and accounts for only 3.2 percent of the companys annualized base rent. The decline in same-property NOI of 180 basis points is mainly attributable to the loss in occupancy partially offset by rental growth from contractual rent step ups, positive leasing spreads for the last four quarters and the impact of rent guaranty payments on certain tenant leases rejected in bankruptcy. The companys leasing pipeline remains active with over 400 leases under negotiation.
Investment Management Programs
The company realized fee income of $10.3 million from its investment management business in the second quarter of 2009. This included $9.0 million in management fees and $1.3 million in other ongoing fees.
At quarter-end, the company had a total of 332 properties in investment management funds with 14 institutional partners.
Structured Investments and Non-Core Business
The company previously announced a strategic realignment of its business activities to concentrate on the ownership and management of shopping centers and a shift away from these other non-core businesses and investments.
During the quarter, the company recognized an aggregate of $6.5 million of recurring income from its preferred equity investments. In addition, the company recognized approximately $15.9 million from investments in its non-core portfolio: $14.3 million in recurring income, which includes $4.2 million from its various investments with Westmont Hospitality and $3.1 million from loans to retailers, and $1.6 million in transaction related income.
Since the beginning of the year, the Company has monetized an aggregate of approximately $53.0 million of its non-core investments and continues to selectively seek opportunities to further this strategic objective.
Non-Cash Impairments
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $176.5 million. Approximately $126 million of the impairment charges relate to non-core assets, including investments in marketable securities, urban mixed-use development projects and non-retail properties, and its preferred equity portfolio.
Approximately $51 million of the non-cash impairment charges relate to the companys shopping center business. The substantial majority of this amount, approximately $47 million, represents the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, adjustments were made to the carrying values of certain programs, the most significant of which relates to its existing 15% economic position in its joint ventures with the PREI sponsored real estate funds, with an adjustment of $42 million. The remaining non-cash impairments were attributable to certain wholly owned properties and unconsolidated joint venture development projects.
Capital Structure and Dividend
In April, the company (i) completed an equity offering of 105.2 million shares of common stock priced at $7.10 which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $718.0 million, and (ii) closed on a new $220.0 million unsecured term loan with a consortium of 12 banks including one new bank. The loan, which bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (subject to a 2.00% LIBOR floor) plus 465 basis points, will mature in April 2011. Proceeds from these capital transactions were used to repay outstanding amounts under the companys unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the company closed on approximately $329 million in secured debt for the consolidated portfolio secured by 16 properties. These loans were sourced from eight different lenders with maturities ranging from three to 15 years and interest rates between 5.95% and 8.00%. Since the beginning of the year, the company has closed a total of $364 million in secured debt and has received term sheets for financing secured by four properties that are expected to generate proceeds of approximately $60 million. As of June 30, 2009, the company maintains over 370 unencumbered properties.
In the joint venture programs, mortgage financing totaling $144 million for six properties were closed during the quarter. Subsequent to quarter-end, the company closed mortgage financing on five additional properties with proceeds of $107 million.
Since its initial public offering in 1991, the company has remained committed to paying a cash dividend. The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share, payable on October 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on October 5, 2009, representing an ex-dividend date of October 1, 2009. Cash dividends paid year-to-date for 2009 total $0.94 per common share. Including the fourth quarter dividend payable in October, cash dividends for the year will total $1.00 per common share. The company expects to return to a normalized quarterly dividend with the announcement of the next dividend payable in January of 2010.
