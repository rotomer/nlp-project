Morgan Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., RBC Capital Markets Corporation, RBS Securities Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc and the Company, as supplemented by the Terms Agreement, dated September 17, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement").  This opinion is being furnished in connection with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Act, and no opinion is expressed herein as to any matter pertaining to the contents of the Registration Statement or related prospectus, other than as expressly stated herein with respect to the issue of the Notes.
As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter.  With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters.  We are opining herein as to the internal laws of the State of New York and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state.  With respect to the opinion expressed below, to the extent that it involves matters arising under the laws of the State of Maryland, we have with your consent relied exclusively on the opinion of Venable LLP, Baltimore, Maryland, attached as Exhibit A hereto, subject to all of the assumptions, limitations and qua lifications set forth therein.
September 24, 2009

Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, when the Notes have been duly executed, issued, and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
Our opinions are subject to:  (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies, or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 514 of the Indenture, (d) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy, (e) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon, and (f) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect.  We express no opinion or confirmation as to federal or state securities laws, tax laws, antitrust or trade regulation laws, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws, antifraud laws, compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, pension or employee benefit laws, usury, environmental law s, margin regulations, FINRA rules or stock exchange rules (without limiting other laws excluded by customary practice).
With your consent, we have assumed (a) that the Indenture and the Notes (collectively, the "Documents") have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company, (b) that the Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (c) that the status of the Documents as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities.
This opinion is for your benefit in connection with the issuance of the Notes and may be relied upon by you and by persons entitled to rely upon it pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Act.  We consent to your filing this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K dated September 24, 2009 and to the reference to our firm contained in the Prospectus under the heading "Legal Matters."
