Exhibit 99.1
NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.  December 7, 2009  Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) announced that it plans to sell 25,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to its effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The underwriters will be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 shares to cover over-allotments, if any.
The sole book-running manager for this offering is Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
The company expects to use the net proceeds received from this offering to partially repay amounts borrowed under its $1.5 billion unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility. The company's $1.5 billion unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in October 2011. The company has an option to extend the facility for an additional one-year term. Amounts outstanding thereunder bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which spread is currently 0.425%. Any remaining net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes.
Information about the offering is available in the preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 7, 2009, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Copies of the prospectus supplement relating to these securities may be obtained by contacting Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Attention: Prospectus Department, 100 Plaza One, Jersey City, New Jersey 07311, telephone: (800) 503-4611 or e-mail at prospectusrequest@list.db.com.
This announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. Any offer, if at all, will be made only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming part of the effective shelf registration statement.
