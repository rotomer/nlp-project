Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
(c)
Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.

In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all inde mnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 7.
.  In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the offering of the Underwritten Securities shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the Underwriters in respect of such offering, as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement in respect of such offering bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

Section 8.

Re:
Kimco Realty Corporation - Restriction on Security Sales
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter is delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Base Underwriting Agreement"), as supplemented by a Terms Agreement (the "Terms Agreement" and, together with the Base Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreement"), each to be entered into by Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as representatives (the "Representatives") of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters").  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters intend to effect a public offering of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), as described in and contemplated by the prospectus supplement dated as of the da te hereof and the base prospectus dated April 24, 2009, related to the registration statement of the Company on Form S-3, File No. 333-158762 (the "Registration Statement"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, 2009 (the "Offering").
The undersigned recognizes that it is in the best financial interests of the undersigned, as an officer and current or future owner of shares, options, warrants, units or other securities of the Company (the "Company Securities"), that the Company complete the proposed Offering.
The undersigned further recognizes that the Company Securities held by the undersigned are, or may be, subject to certain restrictions on transferability, including those imposed by United States federal securities laws.  Notwithstanding these restrictions, the undersigned has agreed to enter into this letter agreement to further assure the Underwriters that the Company Securities of the undersigned, now held or hereafter acquired, will not enter the public market at a time that might impair the underwriting effort.
Therefore, as an inducement to the Underwriters to execute the Underwriting Agreement, the undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that the undersigned will not (i) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, loan, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly (collectively, a "Disposition"), (a) any Company Securities, (b) any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any Company Securities, or (c) any rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Securities held by the undersigned or acquired by the undersigned after the date hereof, or that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned (collectively, the "Lock-Up Shares") for a period commencing on the date hereof and ending 30 days after the date hereof, inclusive (the "Lock-Up Period"), without the prior written consent of the Representatives, or (ii) during the Lock-Up Period enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Company Securities, whether any such aforementioned
transaction is to be settled by delivery of the Company Securities, in cash or otherwise, nor will the undersigned publicly disclose the intention to make any such Disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of the Representatives.  In addition, the undersigned agrees not to exercise or seek to exercise or effectuate in any manner any rights of any nature that the undersigned has, or may have hereafter, to require registration of Lock-Up Shares in connection with the Offering or to require the Company to register under the 1933 Act the undersigned's Disposition of any of the Lock-Up Shares held by the undersigned, or to otherwise participate as a selling securityholder in any manner in any registration effected by the Company under the 1933 Act, including under the Registration Statement, during the Lock-Up Period without t he prior written consent of the Representatives.
For avoidance of doubt, any Company Securities received by the undersigned in the future, including upon the exercise of options granted to or held by the undersigned, will be deemed to be Lock-Up Shares subject to this letter agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Lock-Up Period (i) a transfer of Company Securities to an affiliate of the undersigned or an immediate family member or trust established for the benefit of any member of the undersigned's immediate family may be made, provided the transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this letter agreement prior to such transfer, (ii) the undersigned may sell, pledge, contract to sell or pledge, or otherwise dispose of Company Securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Securities the proceeds of which are used solely to pay taxes due with respect to the vesting of any options or restricted stock of the Company held by the undersigned and (iii) the undersigned may sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of Company Securities that the undersigned receives upon the exercise of stock options granted by the Company.
It is understood that if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions thereof that survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the Shares, you will release the undersigned from the obligations under this letter agreement.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and its transfer agent and registrar are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of Lock-Up Shares if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this letter agreement.  This letter agreement shall be binding on the undersigned and the respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns of the undersigned.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
Very truly yours,
Signature:
