Kimco Realty Corporation announces earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2009;
Declares regular quarterly cash dividend
NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2010--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2009.
Highlights for 2009 and Fourth Quarter 2009
Announced appointment of David B. Henry as CEO; Milton Cooper remains executive chairman;
Increased occupancy to 92.8 percent in its combined shopping center portfolio and to 92.4 percent in its U.S. portfolio at year end 2009, a 40 and 50 basis point increase, respectively, over the prior quarter;
Executed 2,334 leases totaling over 8.4 million square feet in 2009, representing a 47 percent increase in gross leasable area (GLA) over leases signed in 2008;
Excluding the re-tenanting of 21 vacant junior anchor boxes, posted leasing spreads on new leases of 9.5 percent for 2009;
Completed two equity offerings during the year of the companys common stock generating net proceeds in excess of $1.1 billion;
Completed a $300 million 6.875% 10-year unsecured bond offering;
Reduced the companys consolidated net debt to EBITDA ratio by 1.3x from the end of 2008;
Acquired the remaining interest in 33 operating properties from two joint ventures at a price of $956 million; and
Declared regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share.
for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $40.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to net loss to common shareholders of $63.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008. The change in year-over-year net income is primarily related to increases in net income resulting from:
Net income available to common shareholders
$111.1 million of lower impairment charges, net of income tax benefits,
$1.5 million (net) due to an $8.1 million increase in net operating income which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $6.6 million from the acquisitions of the PL Retail Portfolio and 11 operating properties from its joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Advisors during the fourth quarter 2009, and
$9.3 million due to a decrease in general and administrative expense.
Offset by:
$10.6 million due to a reduction in benefit for income taxes, and
$5.6 million of increased interest expense.
For the full year 2009, net loss available to common shareholders was $51.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to net income available to common shareholders of $202.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the full year 2008. The primary difference from 2008 is related to a decrease in transaction income of approximately $153 million, lower gains on the sale of operating properties of $12 million and an increase in non-cash impairments and depreciation of $58 million and $22 million, respectively.
a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, was $119.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $10.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the same period one year ago. For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges, net of related tax benefits, of $0.7 million compared to $111.8 million in the fourth quarter 2008. Excluding impairment charges, FFO per diluted share for the quarter would have been $0.31 compared to $0.46 for the same period in 2008.
Funds from operations (FFO),
For the full year 2009, FFO was $287.1 million compared to $522.9 million in 2008 and FFO per diluted share was $0.82 compared to $2.02 in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges, net of tax, of $179.2 million compared to $121.5 million in 2008. Excluding impairment charges, FFO for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have been $466.3 million or $1.33 per diluted share compared to $644.3 million or $2.49 per diluted share, in the prior year. Additionally, FFO declined in 2009 from 2008 due to the reduction in transaction activity of approximately $153 million and recurring income from Kimcos structured investments and non-retail investments of approximately $35 million. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Non-Cash Impairments
For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $0.7 million, inclusive of a $33.5 million tax benefit, representing a $111.1 million decrease from the fourth quarter 2008. Approximately $25.7 million of the impairment charges, net of tax benefit, for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 relate to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. The remaining non-cash impairments were primarily attributable to the preferred equity portfolio.
For the year ended 2009, the non-cash impairment charges recognized were $179.2 million, inclusive of a $33.5 million tax benefit, representing a $57.7 million increase over 2008. The non-cash impairments for 2009 before the $33.5 million tax benefit were primarily related to $128.7 million of non-retail and structured investment assets. The remaining non-cash impairments were attributable to its investment in its unconsolidated joint ventures of $73.2 million and certain shopping center portfolio assets of $10.8 million.

During the fourth quarter 2009, the company executed a total of 605 leases totaling 1.7 million square feet: 350 new leases for 915,000 square feet and 255 lease renewals for 803,000 square feet.

This includes 1,123 new leases totaling 3.2 million square feet and 1,211 lease renewals for 5.2 million square feet representing increases of 56 percent and 42 percent in GLA, respectively, over the prior year. During the year, the company completed construction on 36 of its 47 development projects. The company estimates costs associated with the remaining 11 projects will be approximately $50 million in 2010 to complete currently approved phases.

Same space leases totaling 1.2 million square feet included 113 new leases for 467,000 square feet at a negative 6.9 percent spread from the prior rent and 217 leases for renewals and options totaling 729,000 square feet at a flat rent spread which together aggregate a negative 3.0 percent rent decrease over the prior rent. Excluding new leases attributable to re-leasing ten bankrupt junior anchors (six former Linens N Things and four former Circuit City), the leasing spread on new leases is 2.1 percent. Same-property NOI for the fourth quarter declined 1.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008.
For the year 2009, the company executed 700 new leases totaling 2.5 million square feet as well as 1,016 lease renewals for 4.8 million square feet in its U.S. portfolio. The average increase in contractual base rent on a cash basis for new leases was 1.8 percent and 1.7 for renewals and options which together aggregate 1.8 percent. Included in same space new leases was the re-tenanting of 21 bankrupt junior anchors (15 former Linens N Things and six former Circuit City). Excluding these 21 leases, the leasing spread on new leases is 9.5 percent. Same-property NOI declined 2.7 percent year-over-year.
Investment Management Programs
At year-end, the company had a total of 287 properties in investment management funds with 14 institutional partners.

As previously announced, the company acquired the remaining 85 percent interest in 21 properties from PL Retail LLC for $175 million during the fourth quarter 2009 based on a total price of $825 million inclusive of the assumption of $564 million in non-recourse mortgage debt and $50 million in perpetual preferred stock. Subsequently during the quarter, the company repaid $269 million of the assumed non-recourse mortgage debt.
Also during the year, Kimco acquired the remaining 85 percent interest in 12 properties from its joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors for approximately $131 million.
Structured Investments and Non-Retail Investments
During the quarter, the company recognized $23 million of income related to its structured investments and other non-retail assets of which $17 million was recurring and $6 million was transactional. The recurring income was primarily attributable to $6 million from preferred equity investments, $7 million of interest and dividends, and $3 million from joint ventures including its various investments with Westmont Hospitality.
In keeping with its objective of disposing of its non-retail investments and other structured investments, the company has monetized an aggregate of approximately $19 million during the fourth quarter of this year and approximately $125 million for the full year 2009. The majority of these investments were comprised of marketable securities and mortgage financing receivables as the market for these investments is readily accessible.
