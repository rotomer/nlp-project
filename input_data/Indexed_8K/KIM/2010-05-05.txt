Exhibit 99.1
Kimco Realty Corporation announces earnings for first quarter 2010;
Declares regular quarterly cash dividend on common and preferred shares
NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 5, 2010--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Highlights for the First Quarter and Subsequent Activity:
Announced appointment of Michael V. Pappagallo as Chief Operating Officer;
Formed a new joint venture with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) that acquired five former PL Retail properties for $370 million;
Established a new joint venture with Cisterra Capital that acquired four shopping center assets for $112 million;
Closed the quarter with occupancy of 92.8 percent in its combined shopping center portfolio and 92.4 percent in the U.S. portfolio;
Executed 754 leases totaling over 2.9 million square feet in the combined shopping center portfolio;
Declared regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share; and
Issued $150 million in Canadian denominated eight year unsecured notes priced at 5.99%.
including non-cash impairments was $39.0 million for first quarter of 2010 or $0.10 per diluted share compared to $26.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009. Comparable earnings per share were reduced approximately $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the companys successful common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009. The change in net income primarily results from a $24.1 million increase in net operating income related to acquisition activity since the comparable period of 2009 and an increase in transaction-related income of approximately $15.1 million, including $2.3 million of gains not included in funds from operations (FFO). These increases were partially offset by non-cash impairments of $7.4 million and increases in interest expense and depreciation of $12.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
Net income available to common shareholders
, a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $126.0 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the first quarter 2010 compared to $117.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. First quarter 2010 FFO include approximately $17.8 million of transaction income partially offset by non-cash impairments of $7.4 million compared to $5.1 million in transaction income and no impairments in the same period for 2009. Excluding transaction income and non-cash impairments, FFO were $115.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the first quarter 2010 compared to $112.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the first quarter 2009. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the attached tables.
Funds from operations (FFO)
Core Business Operations
Shopping Center Portfolio
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 936 operating properties, comprising 823 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 49 in Canada, 45 in Mexico and ten in South America, as well as nine development properties, consisting of two assets in the United States, five in Mexico and two in South America. Additionally, there are nine development projects completed and pending stabilization.
Occupancy in the companys combined shopping center portfolio was 92.8 percent at the end of the first quarter 2010, flat sequentially and up 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The company has 18 former development properties that are approximately 75 percent leased and not included in the companys occupancy until the properties are stabilized. These properties will be included in occupancy the earlier of (i) reaching 90 percent leased or (ii) one year following the projects inclusion in operating real estate; two years for Latin America.
Same-property NOI declined by 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2009. The company executed a total of 754 leases totaling 2.9 million square feet: 373 new leases for 733,000 square feet and 381 lease renewals for 2.1 million square feet. The renewal activity, measured as a percentage of gross leasable area (GLA), represented a 65% increase over the trailing four quarter average and emphasizes the companys continued focus on renewals.
In the U.S. portfolio, occupancy was 92.4 percent at the end of the first quarter, which was flat sequentially but up twenty basis points from the same period in the prior year. During the first quarter, the company executed 503 leases totaling 2.6 million square feet. Same space leases totaling 2.2 million square feet included 99 new leases for 229,000 square feet at a negative 5.6 percent spread from the prior rent and 299 leases for renewals and options totaling 2.0 million square feet at a flat rent spread which together aggregate a negative 0.8 percent rent decrease over the prior leases. The negative leasing spread on new leases is primarily attributable to re-leasing two former spaces previously occupied by Linens N Things and Circuit City. Excluding these two leases, the leasing spread on new leases is 1.1 percent. The Canadian shopping center portfolio ended the quarter with occupancy of 97.8 percent which was flat sequentially. During the first quarter, a total of 60 leases were executed in Canada for 102,000 square feet with 10.8 percent spreads on both new leases and renewals.
The U.S. shopping center portfolio predominantly comprises a grocery anchored component and has a strong position with discount and off-price retailers. In what remains a challenging leasing environment, the characteristics of Kimcos U.S. shopping center portfolio have enabled it to sustain an occupancy level at its 92% historical average since the companys initial public offering in 1991. These characteristics include a well diversified, high-credit quality tenant base, a national footprint with over 92 percent of its shopping centers inside dense, in-fill first-ring suburbs and low average base rent per square foot.
Investment Management Programs
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter 2010, Kimco and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) established a new joint venture which acquired five former PL Retail properties for approximately $370 million including $160 million of mortgage debt. This portfolio, which totals approximately 2.1 million square feet, is primarily grocery-anchored centers including three centers located in California, and one each in Florida and Virginia. CPPIB and Kimco intend to grow this joint venture over time through the acquisition of additional retail properties or portfolios. CPPIBs Real Estate Investment Group invests in commercial properties primarily through joint ventures with operating partners. Kimco holds a 55% ownership interest in addition to acting as the operating partner.
The company also formed a new joint venture with Cisterra Capital which acquired four unencumbered shopping center assets from the Prudential Real Estate Investors joint ventures for $112 million. This portfolio, which totals approximately 615,000 square feet, is primarily grocery-anchored centers with three properties located in Washington and one in California. Kimco holds a 15% ownership interest in addition to acting as the operating partner.
The company also acquired Prudential Real Estate Investors interest in the Kenneth Hahn shopping center for $9 million. This property, located in Los Angeles, CA., comprises 165,000 square feet.
During the first quarter 2010, the company realized fee income of $9.8 million from its investment management business. This included $8.1 million in management fees, $0.6 million in transaction-based fees and $1.1 million in other ongoing fees.
At quarter-end, the company had a total of 284 properties in investment management funds with 15 institutional partners.
Structured Investments and Non-Retail Business
During the quarter, the company recognized $22 million of income related to its structured investments and other non-retail assets of which $16 million was recurring and $6 million was transactional. The recurring income was primarily attributable to $7 million from preferred equity investments, $6 million of interest and dividends, and the remainder mainly from its various joint ventures including Westmont Hospitality. The transaction income was primarily related to gains on sales recognized from the companys Albertsons joint venture.
During the first quarter, the company monetized approximately $7 million of its non-retail investments and other structured investments. The majority of these investments were comprised of marketable securities and mortgage financing receivables. Currently, the company has five other assets from its non-retail portfolio under contract for approximately $27 million.
Dividend and Capital Structure
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share, payable on July 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2010, representing an ex-dividend date of June 29, 2010.
The company also announced that its Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends for the companys preferred shares. The Series F depositary shares, each representing 1/10 of a share of 6.65% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred shares, quarterly dividend of $0.415625 per preferred depositary share will be paid on July 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2010, representing an ex-dividend of June 29, 2010.
The Series G depositary shares, each representing 1/100 of a share of 7.75% Series G cumulative redeemable preferred shares, dividend of $0.484375 per preferred depositary share will be paid on July 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2010, representing an ex-dividend date of June 29, 2010.
During the first quarter, Kimco repaid a $12 million mortgage and two construction loans totaling approximately $30 million that were maturing in 2010. The company maintains access to approximately $1.6 billion of immediate liquidity under its two credit facilities ($1.5 billion U.S. revolving credit facility and its CAD $250 million Canadian revolving credit facility).
Subsequent to quarter close, the company issued $150 million in Canadian denominated unsecured notes that bear interest at 5.99% and mature April 2018. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay the companys existing $150 million Canadian denominated unsecured notes that matured in April 2010. As a result of this activity, the company has only $81.8 million in unsecured debt maturing for the remainder of 2010.
Excluding the U.S. revolving credit facility and the refinancing of the $150 million Canadian denominated unsecured notes, the companys total debt maturities remain well staggered with approximately 23% of total debt maturing through 2012 including less than 3% related to the remainder of 2010.
