Exhibit 99.1
REVISING and REPLACING - Kimco Realty Corporation announces earnings for second quarter 2010; Declares regular quarterly cash dividend on common and preferred shares.
NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 5, 2010--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today revised its second quarter 2010 operating results to reflect second quarter net income available to common shareholders of $12.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, due to the correction of gain on disposition of operating properties, net of tax, in the second quarter to $2.4 million from $5.3 million. This adjustment impacts previously reported net income available to common shareholders and related per share amounts, but does not affect reported funds from operations (FFO) or FFO per diluted share.
The company has updated the text of the press release below as well as the accompanying financial tables and website supplemental reports.
The revised release reads:
Highlights for the Second Quarter and Subsequent Activity:
Generated funds from operations (FFO) before impairments of $0.31 per diluted share; $0.26 including impairments;
Reported a 2.1 percent increase in U.S. same-property net operating income (NOI) from the second quarter of 2009;
Closed the quarter with occupancy of 92.7 percent in its combined shopping center portfolio and 92.3 percent in the U.S. portfolio;
Formed a new joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) with five former PL Retail properties for $370 million;
Established two new joint ventures with BIG Shopping Centers (TLV:BIG), an Israeli public company, with a total of 20 shopping center assets for $493 million;
Executed 714 leases totaling over 2.1 million square feet in the combined shopping center portfolio;
Repaid the remaining $287.5 million guaranteed credit facility related to the joint ventures between Kimco (15%) and investments funds managed by Prudential Real Estate Investors (85%);
Announced appointments of Glenn G. Cohen, chief financial officer and Barbara M. Pooley, chief administrative officer; and
Declared regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share.
Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter was $12.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $146.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the same period in 2009. Second quarter 2010 results include $19.9 million of non-cash impairments, primarily attributable to the transfer of assets between joint venture entities, compared to $176.5 million of non-cash impairments in the second quarter 2009. Excluding non-cash impairments, net income available to common shareholders was $32.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the second quarter 2010 compared to $30.0 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period in 2009. The difference in net income available to common shareholders in the second quarter 2010 over 2009 relates to an increase in net operating income offset by higher interest expense and depreciation related to acquisition activity since the comparable period of 2009.
Year-to-date, net income available to common shareholders per diluted share was $0.13 compared to a net loss available to common shareholders per diluted share of $0.37 through June 30, 2009. Excluding non-cash impairments, year-to-date net income available to common shareholders per diluted share was $0.20 compared to $0.18 per diluted share for the same period in 2009. Comparable earnings per diluted share were lower by $0.03 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $105.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010 compared to an FFO loss of $62.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-cash impairments, FFO were $125.5 million for second quarter 2010 compared to $113.8 million in the same quarter of the prior year with FFO of $0.31 per diluted share for both periods.
Year-to-date, FFO were $231.6 million or $0.57 per diluted share compared to $55.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share through June 2009. Excluding impairments for the six months ended June 2010 and 2009, respectively, year-to-date FFO per diluted share were $0.64 for 2010 and $0.72 for the same period in 2009.
Comparable FFO per diluted share were lower by $0.03 and $0.16 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the attached tables.

Investment Management Programs
As previously announced, the company and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) established a new joint venture which acquired five former PL Retail properties for approximately $370 million including $160 million of mortgage debt encumbering three of the properties. This portfolio, which totals approximately 2.1 million square feet, includes three centers located in California, and one each in Florida and Virginia. Kimco holds a 55% ownership interest in addition to serving as the operating partner.
During the second quarter, the company and BIG Shopping Centers (TLV:BIG), an Israeli public company, entered into a new joint venture that acquired a portfolio of 13 shopping center assets from one of Kimcos existing institutional joint ventures for $394 million including $360 million of mortgage debt. This portfolio, which totals 2.4 million square feet, includes eight centers located in California, two each in Washington and Nevada and one in Oregon. Kimco holds a 33.3% ownership interest in addition to serving as the operating partner.
In addition, the company and BIG formed a joint venture that acquired two unencumbered former PL Retail properties for approximately $69 million. These properties, which total approximately 343,000 square feet, are primarily grocery-anchored centers located in California. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the venture acquired five unencumbered properties from one of Kimcos existing institutional joint ventures for $30 million. This portfolio, which totals 508,000 square feet, includes three centers located in California and two in Nevada. Kimco holds a 50.1% ownership interest in this joint venture in addition to serving as the operating partner.
Subsequent to the close of the second quarter, the company and its joint venture partners, investment funds managed by Prudential Real Estate Investors (the Funds), repaid the remaining $287.5 million balance on the guaranteed credit facility which the joint ventures had with a consortium of banks. Funding for this final repayment was sourced from capital contributions made by Kimco (15 percent) and the Funds (85 percent).
During the second quarter 2010, the company realized fee income of $11.4 million from its investment management business. This included $7.7 million in management fees, $2.4 million in acquisition fees and $1.3 million in other ongoing fees.

Structured Investments and Non-Retail Assets
During the quarter, the company recognized $22 million of income related to its structured investments and other non-retail assets, of which $16 million was recurring. The recurring income was primarily attributable to $7 million from preferred equity investments and $4 million each from interest and dividends and its non-retail joint ventures including Westmont Hospitality. Non-recurring income of $6 million relates to the continued monetization of the companys non-retail assets.
Since the beginning of the year, the company monetized approximately $52 million of its non-retail assets and other structured investments including $44 million in the second quarter. The majority of these investments were from the sale of the companys urban portfolio properties, marketable securities and the repayment of mortgage financing receivables.
