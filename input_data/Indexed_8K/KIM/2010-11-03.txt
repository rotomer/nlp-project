Highlights for the Third Quarter:
Announced a 12.5 percent increase to the quarterly common dividend to $0.18 per common share;
Generated funds from operations (FFO) of $0.27 per diluted share; recurring FFO of $0.28 per diluted share;
Reported a 2.2 percent increase in U.S. same-property net operating income (NOI) compared to the third quarter of 2009;
Closed the quarter with occupancy of 92.7 percent in its combined shopping center portfolio and 92.3 percent in the U.S. portfolio;
Reported positive U.S. cash-basis leasing spreads of 1.5 percent on 282 new leases, renewals and options signed totaling 0.9 million square feet;
Transferred five unencumbered shopping centers to a joint venture with BIG Shopping Centers (TLV:BIG) for approximately $30 million;
Acquired a shopping center in Jacksonville, Fla. for $35.6 million; and
Issued $175 million of 6.90% cumulative redeemable preferred stock and a 4.30% $300 million 7-year unsecured bond with net proceeds repaying approximately $440 million of debt.
Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter was $17.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $28.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the same period in 2009. The change in net income available to common shareholders is attributable to:
$10.8 million charge relating to early extinguishment of debt and a $1.0 million increase in preferred dividends from capital market activities in the current quarter;
$10.6 million increase in real estate related depreciation including $4.3 million related to the joint ventures; and
$3.3 million increase in interest expense and an aggregate of approximately $8.4 million in other miscellaneous reductions to net income.
These reductions were partially offset by:
$16.4 million increase in NOI relating to the transfer of properties from various joint ventures to the company since the comparable period of 2009 and an improvement in property operations;
$3.9 million increase in non-recurring income; and
$3.0 million of gains on sale of operating properties not included in FFO.
Year-to-date, net income available to common shareholders per diluted share was $0.17 compared to a net loss available to common shareholders per diluted share of $0.27 through September 30, 2009. In addition, comparable earnings per diluted share were lower by $0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $110.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $112.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Recurring FFO, which excludes the effects of non-cash impairments of $0.8 million, early extinguishment of debt $10.8 million and non-recurring income of $7.6 million, were $114.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for third quarter 2010. This compares to recurring FFO of $110.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, excluding non-cash impairments and non-recurring income of $2.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in the same quarter of the prior year. In addition, comparable FFO per diluted share were lower by $0.02 for three months ended September 30, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009.
Year-to-date, FFO were $342.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to $167.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, through September 2009. Comparable FFO per diluted share were lower by $0.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the attached tables.

Occupancy in the combined shopping center portfolio was 92.7 percent, an increase of 30 basis points over third quarter 2009;
Occupancy in the U.S. shopping center portfolio was 92.3 percent, an increase of 40 basis points over third quarter 2009;

During the quarter, the company acquired Riverplace Shopping Center, a 257,000 square feet unencumbered shopping center located in Jacksonville, Fla. for $35.6 million. This center is 95.6% occupied and is anchored by a Stein Mart, TJ Maxx and Sears.

Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 936 operating properties, comprising 812 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 63 in Canada, 48 in Mexico and 13 in South America. The operating portfolio includes 21 former development properties that are approximately 75 percent leased and not included in the companys occupancy until the earlier of (i) reaching 90 percent leased or (ii) one year following the projects inclusion in operating real estate (two years for Latin America). Additionally, the company has seven development properties and five completed projects pending stabilization. The remaining development properties consist of two assets in the United States, three in Mexico and two in South America.
Investment Management and Other Joint Venture Programs
During the third quarter, the company and BIG acquired five unencumbered properties from the Prudential Real Estate Investors joint ventures for approximately $30.0 million. This portfolio, which totals approximately 508,000 square feet, includes three centers in California and two in Nevada. Kimco holds a 50.1% ownership interest in this joint venture in addition to serving as the operating partner.
In the third quarter, the company converted a Canadian retail preferred equity investment into a traditional pari-passu joint venture and sold 50% of its ownership interest to an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Financial, a leading international financial services company headquartered in Toronto, Canada, for $29.4 million. The 680,000 square feet grocery-anchored power center, which is located in Quebec, is anchored by Sobeys, Zellers, Future Shop, Toys RUs and The Brick Warehouse.
Additionally during the third quarter, the company and its Canadian preferred equity partner, Anthem Properties, converted a twelve retail property portfolio into a traditional pari-passu joint venture in which Kimco owns a 67% interest. This portfolio, which totals approximately 1.2 million square feet, is primarily grocery-anchored and includes nine properties in British Columbia and three in Alberta.
During the third quarter 2010, the company realized fee income of $9.1 million from its investment management business. This includes $8.0 million in management fees, $0.1 million in acquisition fees and $1.0 million in other ongoing fees.

In addition, the company sold or transferred interests in four preferred equity investments. The company reduced its total preferred equity investments by approximately $92.7 million and recognized non-recurring income of $5.3 million, net of tax, during the quarter as a result of these activities.
Since the beginning of the year, the company has monetized approximately $59.6 million of its non-retail assets and other structured investments including $7.2 million in the third quarter. The majority of these investments were from the sale of the companys urban portfolio properties, marketable securities and the repayment of mortgage financing receivables.
Dividend and Capital Structure
In August, the company completed the offering of 7,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100 fractional interest in a share of the company's 6.90% Class H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share. These depositary shares, priced at $25.00, entitle holders to a 6.90% cumulative dividend or $1.725 per annum, are not convertible into common stock and are redeemable at par at the option of the company on and after August 30, 2015. The net proceeds of approximately $169.7 million were primarily used to repay five mortgage loans in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $150.1 million with interest rates from 6.75% to 7.87% per annum and with maturities from May 2011 to April 2013.
During the quarter, the company issued $300 million of 7-year unsecured senior notes due 2018 at a coupon of 4.30% per annum. The net proceeds of approximately $297.1 million were primarily used to repay a $25 million 7.30% medium term note that matured in September 2010 and prepay two medium term notes totaling $250 million that were scheduled to mature in 2011.
In connection with the prepayment of these mortgage loans and unsecured notes, the company recognized a charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $10.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share of FFO.
During the third quarter, Moodys Investor Services affirmed Kimcos Baa1 senior debt rating and revised its outlook to stable for the company. Additionally, Fitch Ratings assigned Kimco an initial credit rating of BBB+ and a stable outlook.
