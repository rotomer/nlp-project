Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $22.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to $40.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009. The change in year-over-year net income available to common shareholders is primarily related to decreases resulting from:
$23.3 million increase in non-cash impairments, net of tax;
$9.1 million reduction in gains on sale of operating properties not included in FFO;
$8.5 million increase in real estate related depreciation including $4.0 million related to the joint ventures; and
$3.0 million increase in preferred stock dividends resulting from the $175 million cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering in August 2010;
Offset by:
$10.8 million increase in non-recurring income;
$9.7 million increase in NOI relating to an improvement in property operations and the transfer of properties to the wholly-owned portfolio since the comparable period of 2009; and
$5.2 million of other miscellaneous increases to net income mainly attributable to equity in income of joint ventures.
For the full year 2010, net income available to common shareholders was $91.5 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $51.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the full year 2009. In addition, comparable earnings per diluted share were lower by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $118.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $119.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Recurring FFO, which excludes the effects of non-cash impairments and non-recurring income, were $119.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $108.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same quarter of the prior year. In addition, comparable FFO per diluted share were lower by $0.01 for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009.
For the full year 2010, FFO were $460.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $287.1 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in 2009. Recurring FFO for 2010 were $1.14 per diluted share compared to $1.26 for the full year 2009. Comparable FFO per diluted share were lower by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of the companys common share offerings of 134 million shares in 2009. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Non-Recurring Income and Non-Cash Impairments
Recurring FFO excludes non-recurring income of $22.7 million and non-cash impairments of $24.1 million, both net of tax, respectively in the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-recurring income in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to the sale of several urban assets, preferred equity investments and marketable securities as well as a distribution from the Albertsons joint venture. The non-cash impairments in the fourth quarter were primarily transaction-oriented resulting from dispositions or the impending sale of the underlying investments anticipated in 2011. These non-cash impairments include approximately $9 million related to a property under development in Florida and three operating properties held for sale or sold. The additional $15 million relates primarily to structured and other non-retail investments which were sold or are under contract for sale.
On a full year basis for 2010, non-recurring income was $47.3 million and non-cash impairments $52.3 million. In 2009, non-recurring income was $22.6 million and non-cash impairments $179.2 million.
