Exhibit 99.1
Kimco Realty Corporation announces first quarter 2011 results; Reports five percent increase in recurring FFO for first quarter 2011
NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 4, 2011--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Highlights for the First Quarter and Subsequent Activity:
Recognized recurring Funds From Operations (FFO) of $121.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2011 compared to $115.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for first quarter 2010, representing a five percent increase;
Reported FFO of $115.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2011 compared to $126.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the same period in 2010;
Generated positive U.S. cash-basis leasing spreads of 1.4 percent; new leases increased 5.1 percent and renewals/options 0.7 percent;
Increased combined same-property net operating income (NOI) 1.7 percent over the first quarter 2010;
Acquired four shopping centers for approximately $99 million year to date; and
Reduced the non-retail portfolio by approximately $190 million since December 31, 2010 primarily from the sale of the Valad convertible notes.
Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2011 was $14.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to $39.0 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. The change in year-over-year net income available to common shareholders is primarily related to increases of:
$6.6 million in NOI relating to an improvement in property operations and acquisition activity since the comparable period of 2010; and
$0.5 million decrease in non-cash impairments, net of tax
Offset by:
$17.0 million decrease in non-recurring income;
$2.6 million reduction in gains on sale of operating properties not included in FFO;
$9.6 million increase in real estate related depreciation (including $4.9 million related to the joint ventures); and
$3.0 million increase in preferred stock dividends resulting from the $175 million cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering in August 2010.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $115.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $126.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Recurring FFO, which excludes the effects of non-cash impairments and non-recurring income, were $121.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2011 compared to $115.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same quarter of the prior year. Improvement in year-over-year recurring FFO is driven by improving core operating results, new acquisitions, lease-up of Kimcos Mexico portfolio and improvement in the InTown Suites joint venture partially offset by an increase in preferred dividends. A reconciliation of net income to FFO and recurring FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Non-Recurring Income and Non-Cash Impairments
Recurring FFO excludes non-recurring income of $0.9 million and non-cash impairments of $6.9 million, both net of tax. Non-cash impairments in the first quarter were transaction-oriented and resulted from completed or impending dispositions of seven properties; four in the consolidated portfolio and three joint venture properties, totaling approximately $3.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively.
Core Business Operations
Shopping Center Portfolio
First quarter 2011 shopping center portfolio operating results:
Combined Shopping Center Portfolio (includes U.S., Canada and Latin America)
Gross occupancy was 92.8 percent, an increase of 20 basis points over first quarter 2010; Pro-rata occupancy was 92.4 percent;
Same-property net operating income (NOI), including U.S., Canada and Latin America increased 1.7 percent over the first quarter 2010; and
Total leases executed in the portfolio: 696 new leases, renewals and options totaling 2.6 million square feet.
U.S. Shopping Center Portfolio
Gross occupancy increased 40 basis points to 92.5 percent from 92.1 percent in the first quarter of 2010; Pro-rata occupancy was 92.2 percent;
U.S. same-property NOI (cash-basis, excluding lease termination fees and including charges for bad debts) increased 1.1 percent from the same period in 2010; and
U.S. cash-basis leasing spreads increased 1.4 percent; new leases increased 5.1 percent and renewals/options 0.7 percent.
First quarter 2011 occupancy in the combined shopping center portfolio was negatively impacted by 10 basis points on both a gross and pro-rata basis from the addition of four former Mexican development properties that are approximately 79.9 percent occupied. Excluding these four projects, the combined shopping center portfolio gross and pro-rata occupancy would be 92.9 and 92.5 percent, respectively.
Leasing execution includes 106 same space new leases totaling 347,000 pro-rata square feet and 376 lease renewals and options for 1.8 million pro-rata square feet. In addition, the company signed more than 200 new leases totaling 393,000 square feet for spaces vacant for more than one year.
During the first quarter 2011, the company acquired for its wholly-owned portfolio two shopping centers and one outparcel, comprising 190,000 square feet, for a total of approximately $37.4 million, including $15.4 million of mortgage debt. Subsequently in April 2011, Kimco acquired a grocery anchored shopping center for $13.7 million, including $9.3 million of mortgage debt, and disposed of two unencumbered non-strategic shopping centers for $3.2 million.
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 941 operating properties comprising 815 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 62 in Canada, 51 in Mexico and 13 in South America. The operating portfolio includes 17 former development properties in Latin America that are approximately 74 percent leased and are not currently included in occupancy. These properties will be included in occupancy the earlier of (i) reaching 90 percent leased or (ii) two years following the projects inclusion in operating real estate. Additionally, the company has five development properties and two completed projects pending stabilization.
Investment Management and Other Joint Venture Programs
During the first quarter, the company realized fee income of $9.7 million primarily from its investment management business. This includes $7.5 million in management fees, $0.1 million in acquisition fees and $2.1 million in other ongoing fees.
In the first quarter, a joint venture between Kimco and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, in which the company holds a 55% interest, acquired an unencumbered shopping center in Quakertown, Pa. for $52.0 million.
In addition, in separate transactions, the company disposed of two unconsolidated joint venture properties, in which Kimco held a 50% interest, for approximately $24.9 million, including $11.0 million of mortgage debt.
At quarter end, the company had a total of 284 properties in its investment management program with 24 institutional partners and 156 properties in other joint ventures.
Structured Investments and Non-Retail Assets
During the quarter, the company recognized $15.1 million of income related to its structured investments and other non-retail assets. The recurring income of $14.6 million was attributable to $5.1 million from preferred equity investments, $4.5 million from interest and dividends with the remainder primarily from non-retail joint ventures including Westmont Hospitality. Transaction income of $0.5 million was mainly related to foreign currency gains attributable to the Valad convertible notes.
During the first quarter, Kimco reduced its non-retail investments by $11 million primarily from the sale/repayment of marketable securities as well as the sale of one of the Canadian hotels in the Westmont joint venture. As previously announced, subsequent to quarter end, the company reduced the non-retail assets by $178 million from the sale of its Valad convertible notes and the repayment of the Whiterock REIT convertible debentures.
As of April 30, 2011, Kimco has reduced its non-retail assets to approximately $612 million (compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter 2009) which represents five percent of gross assets. Similarly, the company reduced the retail preferred equity portfolio to $156 million compared to $297 million over the same period.
Dividend and Capital Structure
As separately announced, Kimcos Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share, payable on July 15, 2011 to shareholders of record on July 6, 2011, representing an ex-dividend date of July 1, 2011.
At the end of the quarter, the companys consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA was 6.2x compared to 6.3x at year end 2010. In addition, the company maintains access to approximately $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity under its two credit facilities ($1.5 billion U.S. revolving credit facility and its CAD $250 million Canadian revolving credit facility).
2011 Guidance
The company remains committed to its core business objectives:
Increasing shareholder value through the ownership, management and selective acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers;
Continued lease-up of its Latin America portfolio;
Actively engaging in the disposition of its non-retail and non-strategic retail assets; and
Strengthening its balance sheet with a long-term focus on reducing leverage levels and employing a conservative capital mix.
The company reaffirms its 2011 full year recurring FFO guidance range, which does not include any estimate for transactional activities or impairments, of $1.17 - $1.21 per diluted share.
Estimated portfolio metrics for the shopping center portfolio remain as follows:
Combined portfolio occupancy: an increase of 50 to 75 basis points; and
Combined same-property NOI: positive one to three percent.
