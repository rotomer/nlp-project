NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2011--Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Highlights for the Second Quarter:
Recognized recurring Funds From Operations (FFO) of $121.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2011 compared to $115.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2010, representing a five percent increase;
Reported FFO of $118.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2011 compared to $105.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the same period in 2010;
Closed the quarter with gross occupancy in the combined and U.S. shopping center portfolios of 93.1 percent and 92.9 percent, respectively, representing increases of 30 basis points and 50 basis points over the second quarter 2010;
Increased combined same-property net operating income (NOI) 3.1 percent over the second quarter 2010;
Generated positive U.S. cash-basis leasing spreads of 2.1 percent on 292 new leases, renewals and options totaling 1.1 million square feet;
Acquired a total of three shopping centers for approximately $75 million and disposed of eleven non-strategic shopping centers for approximately $49 million;

Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2011 was $23.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to $12.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2010. The change in year-over-year net income available to common shareholders is primarily related to increases of approximately:
$11 million in NOI relating to an improvement in property operations and acquisition activity since the comparable period of 2010;
$12 million from the decrease in non-cash impairments, net of tax; and
$2 million increase in gains on sale of operating properties not included in FFO;
Offset by approximately:
$9 million decrease in non-recurring income (which excludes $3.4 million from the remeasurement of a derivative instrument associated with the Valad convertible notes and included in the calculation of FFO);
$2 million decrease in recurring equity in income of other real estate joint ventures resulting primarily from the transfer or conversion of several preferred equity investments since the comparable period of 2010; and
$3 million increase in preferred stock dividends resulting from the $175 million cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering in August 2010.
Year-to-date, net income available to common shareholders was $38.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $51.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, through June 30, 2010.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $118.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $105.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Recurring FFO, which excludes the effects of non-cash impairments and non-recurring income, were $121.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the second quarter 2011 compared to $115.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same quarter of the prior year.
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, FFO were $233.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $231.6 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Recurring FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2011 were $242.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $231.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same period in 2010. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Non-Recurring FFO and Non-Cash Impairments
During the second quarter of 2011, Kimco recognized non-recurring FFO of $4.6 million and non-cash impairments of $8.1 million, both net of tax.
Non-recurring FFO for the second quarter of 2011 includes $3.6 million of income related to structured investments and non-retail assets offset by $2.4 million of net non-recurring expenses primarily associated with shopping center dispositions (which are included as a component of discontinued operations). In addition, the company recognized $3.4 million from the sale of the Valad convertible notes included in the calculation of FFO only.
Second quarter 2011 non-cash impairments were transaction-oriented resulting from the completed or pending disposition of the companys interest in 13 properties; nine in the consolidated portfolio and four joint venture properties, totaling approximately $5.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
For the second quarter in 2010, the company recognized non-recurring FFO of $9.9 million and non-cash impairments of $19.9 million, both net of tax.
Year-to-date, non-recurring FFO was $5.4 million and non-cash impairments were $15.0 million. For the comparable period in 2010, non-recurring FFO was $27.7 million and non-cash impairments were $27.4 million.

The increase in U.S. same-property NOI of 2.6 percent over the comparable period in 2010 represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive same-property NOI and the highest increase since the first quarter of 2008.

In addition, the company signed more than 130 new leases totaling 617,000 square feet for spaces vacant for more than one year.

During the second quarter 2011, the company acquired for its wholly-owned portfolio two shopping centers, comprising 350,000 square feet, for a total purchase price of approximately $32.0 million, including $9.3 million of mortgage debt.
Kimcos shopping center portfolio includes 939 operating properties comprising 813 assets in the United States and Puerto Rico, 62 in Canada, 51 in Mexico and 13 in South America. The operating portfolio includes 15 former development properties in Latin America that are approximately 74.3 percent leased and are not currently included in occupancy. These properties will be included in occupancy the earlier of (i) reaching 90 percent leased or (ii) two years following the projects inclusion in operating real estate. Additionally, the company has four development properties and three completed projects pending stabilization.
Non-Strategic U.S. Shopping Center Portfolio
During the quarter, Kimco disposed of, in separate transactions, 11 unencumbered non-strategic shopping centers (nine wholly-owned and two unconsolidated joint ventures) comprising 1.0 million square feet for a total of $48.5 million. Kimcos share of proceeds from these sales was $44.6 million.

Transaction earnings for the second quarter 2011 were $3.6 million, net of tax ($7.0 million before tax) which excludes $3.4 million from the sale of the Valad convertible notes (included in the calculation of FFO only). The remaining transaction earnings include $1.0 million from the repayment of the Whiterock REIT convertible debentures with remainder primarily attributable to a gain from a private equity distribution that was in excess of the companys investment.
As of June 30, 2011, non-retail assets total approximately $612 million which represents five percent of gross assets. In addition, the company reduced the retail preferred equity portfolio to $136 million compared to $156 million last quarter and $286 million at June 30, 2010.

Increasing shareholder value through the ownership, management and selective acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers;
Continued lease-up of its Latin America portfolio;
Actively engaging in the disposition of its non-retail and non-strategic retail assets; and
