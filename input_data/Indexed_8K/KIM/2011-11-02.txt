Financial Results
Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter 2011 was $40.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $17.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2010. The change in year-over-year net income available to common shareholders is primarily related to the following items (in millions):
Year-to-date, net income available to common shareholders was $78.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $69.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, through September 30, 2010.
Funds from operations (FFO), a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, were $128.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $110.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Recurring FFO, which excludes the effects of non-cash impairments, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt and non-recurring income, were $123.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2011 compared to $114.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same quarter of the prior year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, FFO were $361.3 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $342.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Recurring FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $366.3 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to $345.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the same period in 2010. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.
Non-Recurring FFO and Non-Cash Impairments
During the third quarter of 2011, Kimco recognized non-recurring FFO of $12.1 million and non-cash impairments of $7.5 million, both net of tax.
Non-recurring FFO for the third quarter of 2011 is mainly attributable to an $8.7 million, net of tax, distribution from the Albertsons joint venture with the remainder primarily due to the disposition of several preferred equity investments, a non-retail joint venture property and one urban asset.
Third quarter 2011 non-cash impairments of $7.5 million were transaction-oriented resulting from the completed or pending disposition of the companys interest in several investments, including three consolidated and four joint venture properties totaling approximately $1.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The remaining $2.4 million of impairments were primarily attributable to several structured and non-retail investments.
For the third quarter in 2010, the company recognized non-recurring FFO of $7.7 million and non-cash impairments of $0.8 million, both net of tax, in addition to a $10.8 million charge on early extinguishment of debt.
Year-to-date, non-recurring FFO was $17.5 million and non-cash impairments were $22.5 million. For the comparable period in 2010, non-recurring FFO was $35.4 million, non-cash impairments $28.2 million and loss on early extinguishment of debt $10.8 million.
