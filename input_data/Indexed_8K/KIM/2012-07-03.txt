Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company has guaranteed all payment obligations of InTown thereunder.  Separately, the Company's partner in the joint venture has provided the Company with a 25% back-stop guarantee.
The credit facility is scheduled to expire on the date that is six months from the date of the Credit Agreement, with six six-month extension options exercisable at the option of InTown, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company, among other things, is subject to covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) maximum indebtedness ratios and (ii) minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios.  
The proceeds of the Credit Agreement were used by InTown to refinance all amounts outstanding under its existing credit facility, which had also been guaranteed by Kimco.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurocurrency Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
(b)
Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan.
SECTION 2.6

If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender(s) (as conclusively certified by such Lender(s) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period;
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given, (i) any Eurocurrency Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (ii) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency Loans shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans, and (iii) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

SECTION 2.7

(a)
Each Borrowing shall be made, continued, or converted pro rata according to the respective Applicable Percentages of the Lenders.  Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the Lenders.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.  All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 12.2 in immediately available funds.  It is understood that, if any payment of principal is made on any day in accordance with the preceding sentence, no interest shall accrue on such day in respect of such principal.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.  If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to any such payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(b)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a Borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.7(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender's share of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower.
SECTION 2.8
Illegality.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any Change in Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, to continue Eurocurrency Loans as such, or to convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall forthwith be cancelled, and (b) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law.  If any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.11.
SECTION 2.9
Requirements of Law.
(a)
If any Change in Law:
(i)
shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except to the extent that such reserve is specifically subject to Section 2.9(c)), special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any relevant office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate;
(ii)
shall impose on such Lender any other condition; or
(iii)
subject any Recipient to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (x) Indemnified Taxes and (y) Excluded Taxes);
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount which such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable with respect to the Loans, this Agreement or the Commitments generally.  If any Lender or any other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(a), it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, that such amounts shall be no greater than amounts that such Lender or such other Recipient is generally charging other borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower.  
provided
(b)
If any Lender shall have determined that the application of any Requirement of Law or any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's treatment of its Loans for internal purposes as of the date on which it became a party hereto) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such request), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, for such reduction with respect to the Loans, this Agreement or the Commitments generally.
(c)
The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender which requests compensation under this Section 2.9(c) (by notice to the Borrower), on the last day of each Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower, so long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Lender may be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes any Eurocurrency Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower) representing such Lender's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation as such Lender shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Lender during such Interest Period, as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such Eurocurrency Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period:
(i)
the principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender to which such Interest Period relates and outstanding on such day; and
(ii)
the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Eurocurrency Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan, and the denominator of which is one (1) the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date (y) such numerator; and
minus
minus
(iii)
a fraction the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is 360.
Any Lender which gives notice under this Section 2.9(c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) in the event such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease to exist.
(d)
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.9 submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The agreements in this Section 2.9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (the date on which all of the foregoing shall have occurred, the ""), until the first anniversary of the Final Date.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.9, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any greater amounts than such Lender(s) is (are) generally charging other borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower.
Final Date

SECTION 2.10
Taxes.
(a)
All payments made by any Loan Party under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law.  If any Withholding Agent determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by any Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.  Each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  The agreements in this Section 2.10(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
(b)
. Without duplication of any payments made pursuant to Section 2.10(a), each Loan Party shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are directly paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.10(b)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  The indemnity under this Section 2.10(b) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the applicable Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.  Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
Indemnification by each Loan Party
(c)

In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make or maintain the Loans hereunder, and in consideration thereof, Kimco hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lender Parties, the prompt and complete payment by the Borrower when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, and Kimco further agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including all reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing any of their rights under the guarantee contained in this Section 12.10.  The guarantee contained in this Section 12.10, subject to Section 12.10(d), shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated.  Kimco agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability under this Section 12.10, it will notify the Administrative Agent or such Lender in writing that such payment is made under the guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 for such purpose.  No payment or payments made by the Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of Kimco under this Section 12.10, which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for the unpaid and outstanding Obligations until, subject to Section 12.10(d), the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitments are terminated.
Guarantee by Kimco
(b)
 Kimco shall remain obligated under this Section 12.10 notwithstanding that (i) without any reservation of rights against Kimco, and (ii) without notice to or further assent by Kimco, (x) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations may be made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (y) any of the Obligations may be continued, increased in amount, or otherwise modified, and the applicable Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and (z) this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Lenders (or the Majority Lenders or Required Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the applicable Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.

The Administrative Agent and any Lender will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, request payment of any applicable Obligation from the Borrower before making any claim against Kimco under this Section 12.10, but will have no further obligation to proceed against the Borrower or to defer for any period a claim against Kimco hereunder.  Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, Kimco waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon Kimco or the Borrower with respect to the Obligations.  The guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) the legality under applicable laws of repayment by the Borrower of any Obligations or the adoption of any applicable laws purporting to render any Obligations null and void, (c) any change in the structure or tax characterization of the Borrower, or any transaction (including any merger or consolidation) to which it may be a party (in each case whether or not permitted under the Loan Documents), (d) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by Kimco or the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (e) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of Kimco or the Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for any Obligations, or of Kimco under the guarantee contained in this Section 12.10, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.  When the Administrative Agent or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this Section 12.10 against Kimco, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve Kimco of any liability under this Section 12.10, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against Kimco.
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional.
(d)
 The guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its Property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
Reinstatement.
(e)
 Kimco hereby agrees that any payments in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Section 12.10 will be paid without setoff or counterclaim, in Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent specified for payment under this Agreement.
Payments.
(f)
 The obligations of Kimco under the guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 are independent of the obligations of the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Kimco whether or not the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.  Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to Kimco.
Independent Obligations.
(g)
 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Kimco waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Loan Party, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Administrative Agent  and the other Lender Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise, extend or otherwise adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Loan Party or any other guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of Kimco hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully paid in cash.  Pursuant to applicable law, Kimco waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Kimco against any Loan Party or any other guarantor, as the case may be, or any security, or would otherwise exonerate Kimco.
Defenses of Kimco.
(h)
 In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party has at law or in equity against Kimco by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, Kimco hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender Party as designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations.  Upon payment by Kimco of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party as provided above, all rights of Kimco against any Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations.  If any amount shall erroneously be paid to Kimco on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lender Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.
Agreement to Pay; Subordination.
(i)
.  Any right or remedy that Kimco may have with respect to the Permitted Third Party Purchaser or its assets upon the occurrence of one or more Additional Assignee Defaults shall not exonerate Kimco from its obligations under the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 or otherwise affect in any manner the Guarantee contained in this Section 12.10 which shall continue to remain in full force and effect in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereunder.
