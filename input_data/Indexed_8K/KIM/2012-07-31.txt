Non-Retail Investments
During the second quarter, Kimco recognized FFO of $15.3 million from its non-retail investments, including $5.3 million of transactional income. The recurring non-retail income of $10.0 million was primarily attributable to $5.9 million from joint ventures, including InTown Suites and $2.0 million from non-retail preferred equity investments.
The companys non-retail investment portfolio book value was $459 million and 3.9 percent of gross assets at June 30, 2012 compared to $612 million, or 5.4 percent of gross assets at June 30, 2011.
Capital Structure
In April, Kimco closed on a new $400 million unsecured term loan that matures on April 17, 2014, with three additional one-year options to extend the maturity until April 17, 2017, at the companys discretion. Interest on this term loan accrues at an annualized rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points. Proceeds from this loan are for general corporate purposes including the repayment of upcoming debt maturities.
At June 30, 2012, Kimcos consolidated net debt to EBITDA as adjusted was 5.6x compared to 6.0x from the prior year. In addition, the company maintains access to approximately $2 billion of immediate liquidity.
As previously announced in July 2012, Kimco issued $225 million of 5.50 percent Class J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Proceeds from this offering will be used to fund the redemption of the companys $175 million 6.65 percent Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as for general corporate purposes, including the potential redemption at the companys option of additional classes of the companys preferred stock when they become redeemable. In connection with this redemption, the company expects to incur a transaction charge to FFO of approximately $0.02 per diluted share during the quarter ending September 30, 2012.
The Company is considering the redemption of its 7.75% Class G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (and the related depositary shares) when permitted under the terms of the Class G Preferred Stock and expects, on or about August 15, 2012, to declare dividends on its common and each class of preferred stock after determining whether to redeem the Class G Preferred Stock.
