INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Description ------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by KLA-Tencor Corporation dated July 24, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Reports $137 Million in Net Income on Revenue of $1.32 Billion for Fiscal Year 2003; Net Income and Earnings Up On Quarter-Over-Quarter Basis SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 24, 2003--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and 2003 fiscal year. For the quarter ending June 30, 2003, the company reported improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Net income of $29 million and earnings per share of $0.15 in the June 2003 fiscal quarter were a 7 percent improvement over net income of $27 million and earnings per share of $0.14 posted in the March quarter. Revenue of $308 million in the June quarter was up slightly from revenue of $304 million in the March quarter. The June 2003 quarter results compare to net income of $47 million and earnings per share of $0.23 on revenues of $373 million for the same period last year. For the full 2003 fiscal year, KLA-Tencor reported net income of $137 million and earnings per share of $0.70 on revenue of $1.32 billion compared, to fiscal year 2002 net income of $216 million and earnings per share of $1.10 on revenues of $1.64 billion. Ken Schroeder, Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor, stated that while the company continues to streamline its operations to increase profitability, it is taking equal care to preserve its ability to capitalize on an industry upturn. "Although the increase in business activity is not broad based, we are definitely seeing a number of our customers reporting an upturn in their business," Schroeder observed. "As the recovery occurs, we believe that the twin forces of rising demand for leading-edge chips and an under-investment in leading-edge capacity will contribute to stronger sales for semiconductor process control equipment. During the year, KLA-Tencor worked closely with semiconductor manufacturers to overcome the yield challenges of next-generation processes, including copper interconnects, sub-130-nm design rules and 300-mm wafers. We are now well positioned to benefit from future industry growth with solutions that have proven critical to ramping and sustaining yields of next-generation chips." KLA-Tencor reported that it ended the year with approximately six months of backlog at current shipping levels. Geographically, during the quarter, the strongest order activity originated from Japan which was above its historical share. China and Singapore were also above historical levels while the United States, Europe, Taiwan and Korea fell below historical levels during the quarter. Gross margins improved from 48.5 percent in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 to 49.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Cost reductions in service and manufacturing expenses contributed to the improvement in gross margins. Operating expenses were unchanged at $122 million; a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense offset a $3 million increase in engineering expense. The company increased total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $90 million to $1.49 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Inventory and accounts receivables decreased during the quarter. Inventory was reduced by $10 million to $259 million, and accounts receivable were lowered by $8 million to $224 million.
