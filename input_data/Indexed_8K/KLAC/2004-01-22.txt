Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Posts Earnings of $45 Million on Revenues of $339 Million for Second Quarter of Fiscal 2004 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its second quarter of fiscal 2004, ended December 31, 2003. The company reported net income of $45 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22 on revenues of $339 million -- an increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. In comparison, the second quarter of fiscal 2003 resulted in net income of $29 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.15 on revenues of $335 million, while in its first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 KLA-Tencor realized net income of $37 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 on revenues of $318 million. According to Chief Executive Officer Ken Schroeder, "Rising chip demand fueled by an improving global economy, coupled with high capacity-utilization rates due to years of industry under-investment, is driving a strong upswing in capacity-related tool orders. Ramping yields of leading-edge processes remains a challenging task and our process control systems are playing a pivotal role in the industry's accelerating capacity expansion efforts. At the same time, we continue to benefit from new technology orders for process control equipment as chipmakers also work to develop even more challenging next-generation processes." Geographically, Korea, China, Singapore and Japan exhibited the strongest order growth compared to historical averages. The U.S. was 24 percent of orders, below its historical average of 25-30 percent; Taiwan was 18 percent, below its historical average of 20 percent; Korea, China and Singapore combined was 18 percent, higher than their historical average of 15 percent; Japan was 26 percent, higher than its historical average of 20 percent, and Europe was 14 percent, at its historical average of 15 percent. Gross margins improved three percent sequentially to 54 percent, which helped drive net income higher by 21 percent over the previous quarter. Improvements in capacity absorption and manufacturing efficiencies contributed to the gain in gross margins. KLA-Tencor increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $63 million to $1.63 billion, while the balance sheet remained free of long-term debt. Higher product shipments led to an increase in accounts receivables of $37 million to $246 million. However, strong collections resulted in shipments based Days Sales Outstanding of 59 days. Inventory increased by $14 million to $288 million, as the Company expanded production to meet rising customer demand. The company has scheduled a live webcast of its second quarter fiscal 2004 earnings conference call for Thursday, January 22, 2004, at 2:00 p.m. (PT).
