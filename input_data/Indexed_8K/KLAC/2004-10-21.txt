Exhibit 99.1 KLA-Tencor Reports Earnings of $116 Million on Revenue of $519 Million for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 2004--KLA-Tencor Corporation (Nasdaq:KLAC) today announced operating results for its first quarter of fiscal 2005, ended September 30, 2004. Net income and earnings per diluted share rose to $116 million and $0.58 on revenues of $519 million, as the company reported sequential and year-over-year improvements in operating results. Revenues rose 15 percent from $450 million in the prior quarter and 63 percent from $318 million compared to the same period last year. Net income was also significantly higher, increasing from $96 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $37 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. "Our strong financial results reflect leading chipmakers' strategic investments in process control technology to help them stay on Moore's law and reduce the time and costs associated with producing next-generation chips," explained Ken Schroeder, President and Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor. "Our customers know that process control technology is instrumental to increasing their competitiveness and production success. Going forward we remain focused on investing in the solutions our customers will need to accelerate their development and production ramps at future nodes, while also optimizing the performance of their existing tools and technologies." KLA-Tencor reported that it ended the quarter with approximately six months of backlog at current shipping levels. Geographically, the strongest order activity originated from Japan, which was above its historical share. Korea, China, and Singapore were also above historical levels while order levels for the United States, Europe and Taiwan were below their historical averages during the quarter. Rising revenues and improved cost-structure resulted in record level gross margin, pretax, and operating margin percentages in the current quarter. Operating expenses increased from $141 million in the prior quarter to $146 million in the current quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased by $10 million to $1.89 billion and the company repurchased $74 million of its shares during the quarter. Accounts receivable decreased by $7 million to $366 million on strong collections, while inventory increased by $36 million to $373 million on new product introductions and higher planned production levels.
