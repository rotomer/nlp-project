Item 8.01 Other Events
As previously disclosed in the preliminary merger proxy filed by KLA-Tencor Corporation and ADE Corporation, both KLA-Tencor and ADE filed Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or the Antitrust Division, pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, or the HSR Act, by March 8, 2006. As a result, the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger between KLA-Tencor and ADE was scheduled to expire on April 7, 2006. However, prior to that date, following the submission of materials relating to the transaction to the Antitrust Division staff and consultation with the staff, KLA-Tencor voluntarily withdrew its Notification and Report Form and re-filed the form today. KLA-Tencor's re-filing gives the Antitrust Division staff more time to review the information submitted by the parties and to complete its initial investigation before the staff must determine whether to issue a formal request for additional information. The effect of this re-filing is to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act to May 11, 2006.
