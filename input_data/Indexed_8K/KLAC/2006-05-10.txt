Item 8.01 Other Events
As previously disclosed in the preliminary merger proxy filed by KLA-Tencor Corporation and ADE Corporation, both KLA-Tencor and ADE filed Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or the Antitrust Division, pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, or the HSR Act, by March 8, 2006. As a result, the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger between KLA-Tencor and ADE was scheduled to expire on April 7, 2006. Following discussion with the Antitrust Division staff, however, KLA-Tencor voluntarily withdrew its Notification and Report Form and then re-filed the form on April 11, 2006. The effect of this re-filing was to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act to May 11, 2006. Today, the Antitrust Division staff informed KLA-Tencor that Antitrust Division would not issue a second request extending the HSR Act waiting period and granted early termination of the HSR waiting period effective today.
