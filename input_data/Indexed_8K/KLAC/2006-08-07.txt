Item 8.01 Other Events
On August 3, 2006, the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") adopted a majority stockholder vote standard for uncontested director elections. Under this new majority vote standard, which replaces plurality voting for uncontested director elections, a nominee must receive favorable votes from holders of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in order to be elected to the Board of Directors. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, if an incumbent director nominee is not elected, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors immediately upon certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation within 180 days from the date of the certification of the election results and will publicly disclose its decision. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
