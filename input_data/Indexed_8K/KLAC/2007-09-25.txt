In its meeting held on September 20, 2007, the independent members of the Board of Directors of KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan") to correct the formula used for calculating the "Prorated Annual Incentive" payable to Plan participants upon certain events of termination of employment, so that the proration of the applicable bonus amount will be calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed in the Company's fiscal year (as opposed to the calendar year, as previously and erroneously drafted). The amendment replaced the term "calendar year" with the term "fiscal year" in the definition of "Prorated Annual Incentive."
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
