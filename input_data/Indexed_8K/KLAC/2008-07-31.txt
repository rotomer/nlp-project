Exhibit 99.1
 
MILPITAS, Calif., July 31, 2008 KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended on June 30, 2008. The Company reported GAAP net income of $76 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.43 on revenue of $591 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. For the year ended June 30, 2008, the Company reported GAAP net income of $359 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.95 on revenue of $2.5 billion.
"This was a year of solid execution for KLA-Tencor in a tough overall market environment. We expanded our potential market opportunity through the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems, and delivered good operating performance in a very challenging demand environment. Our strong performance in the face of these challenges reflects the strength of our market leadership, the superior value we deliver to our customers in helping them meet their yield demands, and the resilience of the KLA-Tencor team," said Rick Wallace, CEO of KLA-Tencor.
 
A reconciliation between GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, restatement or restructuring related items.
