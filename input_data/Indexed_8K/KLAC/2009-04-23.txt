"We executed our cost containment programs well during the quarter and met our bookings and revenue guidance, in spite of the continued weakness in the global economy and the semiconductor equipment market," commented Rick Wallace, president and CEO of KLA-Tencor. "Although demand remains at low levels today, we are encouraged to see investments in technology development activity in the March quarter for customers at the leading edge. KLA-Tencor continues to advance its market leadership through maintaining our customer focus and driving our technology and innovation roadmaps."
 
A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results include the impact of stock-based compensation, but exclude the impact of acquisition, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, restatement, and restructuring related items.
