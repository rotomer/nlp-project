Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
As previously announced, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") presented its annual SEMICON West analyst briefing on July 12, 2011 at the W San Francisco Hotel. The presentation was accessible via live webcast through (and a replay of the presentation is currently available on) the Investors page of the Company's website at http://ir.kla-tencor.com/, and the presentation otherwise complied with the notification, public accessibility and other requirements of Regulation FD.
During the presentation, Richard P. Wallace, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, provided updated guidance regarding certain of the Company's anticipated financial metrics for its recently completed fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, which ended on June 30, 2011. On April 28, 2011, in the Company's quarterly earnings conference call, the Company had provided preliminary guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 of bookings in a range of $682 million to $853 million, revenue in a range of $840 million to $900 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share ("EPS") in a range of $1.28 to $1.44. During the July 12, 2011 SEMICON West analyst briefing, Mr. Wallace said with respect to the Company's operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, "[I]n bookings, we were at the upper end, as we were in revenue and EPS." Mr. Wallace also stated that "FY11 will end up at around 37% [non-GAAP] operating margin" and that, for fiscal year 2011, "[non-GAAP] gross margin is expected to be 61%."
Mr. Wallace also provided information during the presentation regarding the Company's outlook for selected operating results in future periods. That information is available through the Regulation FD-compliant webcast that is accessible on the Company's website.
