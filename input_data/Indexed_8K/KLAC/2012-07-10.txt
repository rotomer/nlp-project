Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
As previously announced, KLA-Tencor Corporation (the "Company") presented its annual SEMICON West analyst briefing on July 10, 2012 at the W San Francisco Hotel. The presentation was accessible via live webcast through (and a replay of the presentation is currently available on) the Investor Relations page of the Company's web site at http://ir.kla-tencor.com/, and the presentation otherwise complied with the notification, public accessibility and other requirements of Regulation FD.
During the presentation, Richard P. Wallace, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, provided updated guidance regarding certain of the Company's anticipated financial metrics for its recently completed fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended on June 30, 2012.
On April 26, 2012, in the Company's quarterly earnings conference call, the Company had provided preliminary guidance for bookings, revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share ("EPS") for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. During the July 10, 2012 SEMICON West analyst briefing, Mr. Wallace said, with respect to the Company's operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, "We finished the March quarter at about $834 million in bookings, and our guide was $775 to 950 [million] in the June quarter.   We ended up about 1% off of the March quarter, so right around $827 million in bookings." Mr. Wallace also stated that the Company's revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 were "toward the high end of the range - the range was $840 to 900 million." With respect to EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, Mr. Wallace said, "EPS we guided $1.20 to $1.38. At the guided tax rate of 26%, we would have been toward the upper end of the range. A preliminary look at the tax rate suggests that we'll actually be above the range when we finalize those results."
Mr. Wallace also provided information during the presentation regarding the Company's outlook for selected operating results in future periods. That information is available through the Regulation FD-compliant webcast that is accessible on the Company's website.
