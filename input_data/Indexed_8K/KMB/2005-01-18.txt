Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
Effective as of the end of the day on November 30, 2004, Kimberly-Clark Corporation completed the distribution to its stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of Neenah Paper, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary formed in April 2004 to facilitate the spin-off of Kimberly-Clark's Fine Paper and Technical Papers businesses and its Canadian pulp mills (the "Spin-off"). In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 144, Kimberly-Clark's prior period Consolidated Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements and related disclosures will be reported to present the results of Neenah Paper's fine paper and technical paper businesses, which were previously included in the Business-to-Business segment, as discontinued operations. Prior to the Spin-off, Kimberly-Clark internally consumed approximately 90% of the pulp produced by the Canadian pulp business. In connection with the Spin-off, Kimberly-Clark entered into a long-term pulp supply agreement with Neenah Paper whereby Kimberly-Clark will continue to consume a substantial portion of the pulp produced by Neenah Paper. Therefore in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144 the results of Neenah Paper's Canadian pulp business do not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations. To facilitate reviewing Kimberly-Clark's future periodic reports, the following Exhibits are attached to this Current Report:
