The Kimberly-Clark Corporation Executive Severance Plan was amended and restated by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation's Board of Directors on November 16, 2005.
 
The Plan provides certain eligible executives, including Named Executive Officers, severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment in certain qualified circumstances related to a change in control of the Corporation.
 
The Executive Severance Agreements under the Plan (the "Agreements") provide that upon a qualified termination of employment related to a change in control, the participant will receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (1) three times annual base salary and the target bonus award for that fiscal year, (2) the value, based on the Corporation's stock price at the date of the participant's termination, of forfeited restricted stock, time-vested restricted share units, performance-vested restricted share units (at the greater of target or the attainment of the performance goal as of the end of the prior year) and certain unvested incentive stock options, (3) the value of three additional years of service and compensation under the Corporation's pension plan and its related supplemental plans, and (4) three years of COBRA premiums for medical and dental coverage. In addition, nonqualified stock options, and certain incentive stock options, will vest and be exercisable within the earlier of five years from the participant's termination or the remaining term of the option.
 
The Plan also provides that in certain circumstances if the participant incurs excise tax due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the participant is entitled to an additional cash payment so that the participant will be in the same position as if the excise tax were not applicable. The Agreements with the Named Executive Officers will be extended for an additional three years from the date of execution.
 
A copy of the Plan is attached as Exhibit 10b to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION
EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
As
Amended and Restated
As of November 15, 2005
1.             
Preamble and Statement of Purpose
. The purpose of this Plan is to assure the Corporation that it will have the continued dedication of, and the availability of objective advice and counsel from, key executives of the Corporation notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a change of control of the Corporation.
In the event the Corporation receives any proposal from a third person concerning a possible business combination with the Corporation, or acquisition of the Corporation's equity securities, or otherwise considers or pursues a transaction that could lead to a change of control, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") believes it imperative that the Corporation and the Board be able to rely upon key executives to continue in their positions and be available for advice, if requested, without concern that those individuals might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a possibility.
Should the Corporation receive or consider any such proposal or transaction, in addition to their regular duties, such key executives may be called upon to assist in the assessment of the proposal or transaction, to advise management and the Board as to whether the proposal or transaction would be in the best interest of the Corporation and its stockholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.

In addition, nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to entitle a Participant under this Plan to any rights, or to payments under this Plan, with respect to any plan in which the Participant was not a participant prior to a Qualified Termination of Employment.

(c)           
Equity Participation Plan - Option Shares
(i) Except with respect to incentive stock options outstanding at the effective date of the Participant's Agreement for which the Option Price is lower than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at such date, all stock options that were granted to the Participant under any of the Equity Plans, including but not limited to any substitute plans adopted prior to the Relevant Date (or any successor or additional plan), that were outstanding both on the Relevant Date and immediately before the Qualified Termination of Employment, shall vest and become exercisable and the Qualified Termination of Employment of the Participant shall be deemed a retirement for purposes of exercising the stock options under the terms of the Equity Plans, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Incentive Stock Options that were outstanding at the effective date of the Participant's Agreement for which the Option Price is lower than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at such date, and which were forfeited upon the termination of the Participant's employment, a lump sum amount equal to the excess of (I) the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of termination of the shares of common stock of the Corporation or other equity security then subject to such Incentive Stock Options over (II) the aggregate option price for such shares or other equity security;
(d)

event the number of restricted shares and/or restricted share units was to be determined by the attainment of performance goals according to a schedule determined by the Committee, the number of shares that shall be considered to vest shall the greater of the target level established or the number of shares which would have vested based on the attainment of the Performance Goal as of the end of the prior year;

(f)

. The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the Corporation nor the Board shall be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by benefits under the Plan.

Any liability of the Corporation to any Participant with respect to any benefit shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations
 
-9-
 
 
 
created by the Plan and the Agreement; no such obligation shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or any encumbrance on any property of the Corporation.
9.            
Certain Reduction of Payments by the Corporation when Payments Do Not Exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount
.
(a)           This Section 9 shall only be applicable if it shall be determined that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount. Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other certified public accounting firm designated by the Corporation (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject a Participant, other than a Participant entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 10 below, to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Separation Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount." If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Separation Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount. All fees payable to the Accounting Firm with respect to this Section 9 shall be paid solely by the Corporation.
(b)           If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Separation Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Corporation shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the Participant may then elect, in his or her sole discretion, which and how much of the Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the Corporation in writing of his or her election within ten days of his receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the Participant within such ten-day period, the Corporation may elect which of such Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the Participant promptly of such election. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Participant and shall be made within 60 days of a termination of employment of the Participant. As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant such Separation Payments as are then due to the Participant under Section 5 of this Plan and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant in the future such Separation Payments as become due to the Participant under this Plan.
(c)           While it is the intention of the Corporation to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Participant would thereby be increased, as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment") or that
 
-10-
 
 
 
additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, any such benefit of a Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the Corporation together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by a Participant to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan or any Agreement to the contrary, the obligation with respect to any Overpayment or Underpayment under this Section 9 shall be conditioned upon the Overpayment or Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(a) Anything in this Plan or any Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth in this paragraph, in the event that it shall be determined that any Payment to a Participant would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Participant shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Participant of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Participant retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(a), if it shall be determined that the Participant would (absent this sentence) be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Participant and the provisions of Section 9 of this Plan shall apply to that Participant. The Corporation's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 10 shall not be conditioned upon the Participant's termination of employment.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 10(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 10, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of
 
-11-
 
 
 
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Participant within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 10, shall be paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the applicable Participant no earlier than the date of payments under Section 5 of this Plan, or if later within 5 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Participant. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 10(c) and the Participant thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Participant on the later of the date of such determination or after the date payments are due under Section 5 of this Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan or any Agreement to the contrary, the obligation with respect to any Underpayment under this Section 10 shall be conditioned upon the Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(c) Each Participant shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Participant is informed in writing of such claim. The Participant shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Participant gives such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Corporation desires to contest such claim, the Participant shall:
 
 
-12-
 
 
 
without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Corporation,
provided, however
, that the Corporation shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(c), the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Participant and direct the Participant to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Corporation shall determine;
provided, however
, that, if the Corporation directs the Participant to pay such claim and directs the Participant to sue for a refund, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and
provided, further
, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Participant with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Corporation's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(d)           If, after the receipt by a Participant of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Participant's behalf pursuant to Section 10(c), the Participant becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Participant shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of Section 10(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Participant's behalf pursuant to
 
-13-
 
 
 
Section 10(c), a determination is made that the Participant shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Corporation does not notify the Participant in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of a Participant, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and by signing an Agreement, the Participant shall consent to such withholding.
11.           
No Duty to Mitigate
. In no event shall any Participant be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Participant obtains other employment.
12.           
Termination and Amendment of this Plan
. The Board shall have power at any time, in its discretion, to amend, abandon or terminate this Plan, in whole or in part;
except
that no amendment, abandonment or termination shall impair or abridge the obligations of the Corporation under any Agreements previously entered into pursuant to this Plan except as expressly permitted by the terms of such Agreements.
13.           
Successors
. The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of its business and/or assets to assume expressly and agree to perform this Plan and the Agreements in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.

:
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has approved the Corporation entering into severance agreements with key executives of the Corporation and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan"); and
WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries and has been selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation as a key executive to be an Executive under the Plan; and
WHEREAS, should the Corporation receive or learn of any proposal by or from a third person concerning a possible business combination with, or acquisition of equity securities of, the Corporation, or should the Corporation otherwise consider or pursue a transaction that could lead to a change of control, the Board believes it imperative that the Corporation and the Board be able to rely upon the Executive to continue in the Executive's position, and that they be able to receive and rely upon the Executive's advice, if they request it, as to the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, without concern that the Executive might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a possibility; and
WHEREAS, should the Corporation receive or consider any such proposal or transaction, in addition to the Executive's regular duties, the Executive may be called upon to assist in the assessment of the proposal or transaction, advise management and the Board as to whether the proposal or transaction would be in the best interest of the Corporation and its stockholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate;
NOW, THEREFORE, to assure the Corporation that it will have the continued dedication of the Executive and the availability of the Executive's advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such a proposal or transaction, and to induce the Executive
 
 
 
to remain in the employ of the Corporation, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Corporation and the Executive agree as follows:
In the event a third person, in order to effect a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), begins a tender or exchange offer, circulates a proxy to stockholders, or takes other steps, or in the event the Corporation considers taking, or decides to take, steps that are expected to lead to a Change of Control, the Executive agrees that the Executive will not voluntarily leave the employ of the Corporation, and will render the services contemplated in the recitals to this Agreement and the Plan, until the efforts by the third party or the Corporation to effect a Change of Control are abandoned or until a Change of Control has occurred.

In the event of a Qualified Termination of Employment of the Executive who is not a Key Employee, a lump sum cash payment or payments shall be made to such Executive within 10 days following the last day of employment of the Executive with the Corporation except to the extent not then calculable, in which case such portions shall be paid as soon as practicable following the ability to calculate the amount thereof:

(vi)
Incentive Investment Plan
. A lump sum amount equal to any benefits under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Salaried Employees Incentive Investment Plan (or any successor or additional plan) that the Executive has accrued, but that are forfeited as a result of his or her termination of employment, based upon the value of the Executive's account as of the most recent valuation date before the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment;

(ii)
Participation in Employee Benefit Plans
. The Executive's participation in savings, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, and/or stock appreciation rights plans of the Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries shall continue only through the last day of the Executive's employment. Any terminating distributions and/or vested rights under such plans shall be governed by the terms of those respective plans. Furthermore, the Executive's participation in any insurance plans of the Corporation and rights to any other fringe benefits shall except as otherwise specifically provided in such plans or corporate policy, terminate as of the close of the Executive's last day of employment, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to entitle the Executive to any rights, or to payments under this Agreement, with respect to any employee benefit plan which the Executive was not a participant prior to a Qualified Termination of Employment.

C.
Definition of Change of Control
. For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have taken place upon the first of the following to occur after the date of this Agreement: (i) a third person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, acquires shares of the Corporation having 20% or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the election of directors of the Corporation; or (ii) as the result of any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), the persons who
 
 
 
were directors of the Corporation before the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any successor to the Corporation.
          
D.
Definition of Subsidiary
. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Subsidiary" shall mean any domestic or foreign corporation at least twenty percent (20%) of whose shares normally entitled to vote in electing directors is owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation or by other Subsidiaries.
          
E.
Certain Reduction of Payments by the Corporation when Payments Do Not Exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount
.
          
(i)
This Paragraph E shall only be applicable if it shall be determined that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount. If the Executive is not entitled to a Gross-Up Payment pursuant to Paragraph F below, then anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other certified public accounting firm designated by the Corporation (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Separation Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount." If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Separation Payment shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount. All fees payable to the Accounting Firm with respect to this Paragraph E shall be paid solely by the Corporation.
         
(ii)
If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Separation Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Corporation shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the Executive may then elect, in the Executive's sole discretion, which and how much of the Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the Corporation in writing of the Executive's election within ten days of the Executive's receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the Executive within such ten-day period, the Corporation may elect which of such Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the Executive promptly
 
 
 
of such election. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this paragraph shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive, and shall be made within 60 days of a termination of employment of the Executive. As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive such Separation Payments as are then due to the Executive under this Agreement, and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive in the future such Separation Payments as become due to the Executive under this Agreement.
         
(iii)
While it is the intention of the Corporation to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to the Executive hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Executive would thereby be increased as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment"), or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, any such benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Corporation, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code;
provided, however
, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code, or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the
 
 
 
Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligation with respect to any Overpayment or Underpayment under this Paragraph E shall be conditioned upon the Overpayment or Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
          
F.
Certain Additional Payments by the Corporation when Payments Exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount
.
(i) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth in this paragraph, in the event that it shall be determined that any Payment to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (i) of Paragraph F, if it shall be determined that the Executive would (absent this sentence) be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the provisions of Paragraph E above shall apply to that Executive. The Corporation's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Paragraph F shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
(ii) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F, all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph F, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation. Any Gross-Up
 
 
 
Payment, as determined pursuant to this Paragraph F, shall be paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive no earlier than the date of payments under Paragraph A of this Agreement, or if later within 5 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive on the later of the date of such determination or after the date payments are due under Paragraph A of this Agreement. The Corporation's obligation with respect to any underpayment under this Paragraph F shall be conditioned upon the Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated.
(iii) The Executive shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim. The Executive shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Corporation desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
 
 
 
 
 
provided, however
, that the Corporation shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F, the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Corporation shall determine;
provided, however
, that, if the Corporation directs the Executive to pay such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and
provided, further
, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Corporation's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with
 
 
 
respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(iv) If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, if applicable) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Corporation does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and by signing this Agreement, the Executive consents to such withholding.

(x)
Good Reason
: Termination by the Executive for "Good Reason" shall mean the Executive's termination of his or her employment after the occurrence (without the Executive's express written consent) of any one of the following acts by the Corporation, or failures by the Corporation to act (subject to the Corporation's ability to correct as set forth below):

the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent with the Executive's status as a key executive officer of the Corporation or a substantial adverse alteration in the nature or status of the Executive's responsibilities and position from those in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control, other than such alteration primarily attributable to the fact that the Corporation is no longer a public company;

However, in order to terminate employment for Good Reason, (1) the Executive must give the Corporation a notice setting forth the circumstances of the act or failure to act alleged to constitute Good Reason within 30 days after the Executive first has actual notice of such act or failure, and stating that the Executive has determined that such act or failure constitutes "Good Reason" hereunder, (2) the Corporation must fail to correct such act or failure within 30 days after it receives such notice from the Executive, and (3) the Executive must actually terminate his or her employment during the period of 30 days beginning 30 days after the Corporation receives such notice.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any previously executed noncompetition agreement shall continue in effect following the execution of this Agreement and the Relevant Date.
        
(ix)
Termination
. This Agreement shall terminate on the third anniversary of the date hereof unless either (1) a Change of Control occurs on or before such third anniversary or (2) the Board determines to extend this Agreement for an additional three-year term or such shorter period as it determines to be appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time when this Agreement would otherwise terminate, a third party that has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or a Change of Control is otherwise under consideration, then this Agreement shall automatically continue in effect until (A) a Change of Control occurs, in which event this Agreement shall thereafter remain in effect in accordance with its terms, or (B) the Board makes a good faith determination that in its opinion, the efforts by the third party or the Corporation to effect a Change of Control have been abandoned, at which time the Agreement shall terminate unless it is extended pursuant to clause (2) of the preceding sentence.

:
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has approved the Corporation entering into severance agreements with key executives of the Corporation and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan"); and
WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries and has been selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation as a key executive to be an Executive under the Plan; and
WHEREAS, should the Corporation receive or learn of any proposal by or from a third person concerning a possible business combination with, or acquisition of equity securities of, the Corporation, or should the Corporation otherwise consider or pursue a transaction that could lead to a change of control, the Board believes it imperative that the Corporation and the Board be able to rely upon the Executive to continue in the Executive's position, and that they be able to receive and rely upon the Executive's advice, if they request it, as to the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, without concern that the Executive might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a possibility; and
WHEREAS, should the Corporation receive or consider any such proposal or transaction, in addition to the Executive's regular duties, the Executive may be called upon to assist in the assessment of the proposal or transaction, advise management and the Board as to whether the proposal or transaction would be in the best interest of the Corporation and its stockholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate;
NOW, THEREFORE, to assure the Corporation that it will have the continued dedication of the Executive and the availability of the Executive's advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of such a proposal or transaction, and to induce the Executive
 
 
 
to remain in the employ of the Corporation, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Corporation and the Executive agree as follows:
In the event a third person, in order to effect a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), begins a tender or exchange offer, circulates a proxy to stockholders, or takes other steps, or in the event the Corporation considers taking, or decides to take, steps that are expected to lead to a Change of Control, the Executive agrees that the Executive will not voluntarily leave the employ of the Corporation, and will render the services contemplated in the recitals to this Agreement and the Plan, until the efforts by the third party or the Corporation to effect a Change of Control are abandoned or until a Change of Control has occurred.
In the event of a Qualified Termination of Employment (as hereinafter defined):
          
A.
Lump-Sum Cash Payment
. The Corporation will pay to the Executive, who is a Key Employee, as compensation for services rendered to the Corporation a lump-sum cash amount or amounts (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld) calculated by adding the amounts specified in subparagraphs (i) through (ix) below, such payments to be made at the first day of the seventh month following the date of separation from service except to the extent not yet calculable, in which case such portions shall be paid as soon as practicable following the ability to calculate the amount. In the event of a Qualified Termination of Employment of the Executive who is not a Key Employee, a lump sum cash payment or payments shall be made to such Executive within 10 days following the last day of employment of the Executive with the Corporation except to the extent not then calculable, in which case such portions shall be paid as soon as practicable following the ability to calculate the amount thereof:
          
(i)
Salary plus Incentive Compensation
. A lump sum amount equal to two times the sum of (a) the Executive's annual base salary at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Relevant Date or, if higher, immediately before the Qualified Termination of Employment and (b) the Annual Bonus Amount;
         
(ii)
Equity Participation Plan - Participation Shares
. A lump sum amount equal to the payment to which the Executive would have been entitled had all Participation Shares awarded to the Executive under any Equity Plan that were outstanding on the Relevant Date and which had not matured as of the date
 
 
 
 
 
of termination of employment and which will not mature as a result of the termination of employment, matured, such payment to be determined as though such award had matured and its book value at maturity been determined on the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the date of termination of the Executive's employment;
         
(iii)
Equity Participation Plan - Option Shares
. (a) Except with respect to incentive stock options outstanding at the effective date of the Executive's Agreement for which the Option Price is lower than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at such date, all stock options that were granted to the Executive under any of the Equity Plans, including but not limited to any substitute plans adopted prior to the Relevant Date (or any successor or additional plan), that were outstanding both on the Relevant Date and immediately before the Qualified Termination of Employment, shall vest and become exercisable and the Qualified Termination of Employment of the Executive shall be deemed a retirement for purposes of exercising the stock options under the terms of the Equity Plans, and (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Incentive Stock Options that were outstanding at the effective date of the Executive's Agreement for which the Option Price is lower than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at such date, and which were forfeited upon the termination of the Executive's employment, a lump sum amount equal to the excess of (I) the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of termination of the shares of common stock of the Corporation or other equity security then subject to such Incentive Stock Options over (II) the aggregate option price for such shares or other equity security;
       
(iv)
Restricted Stock
. With respect to restricted stock granted to the Executive under any of the Equity Plans that were outstanding but not vested on the Relevant Date and which are forfeited as a result of the termination of the Executive's employment, a lump sum amount equal to the Fair Market Value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Corporation (or such other equity security into which the restricted stock has been converted) on the date of termination of employment;
         
(v)
Successor or Additional Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Incentive Compensation, and Bonus Plan.
A lump sum amount equal to the payment to which the Executive would have been entitled had all amounts awarded
 
 
 
or granted to the Executive, vested or matured, under any stock appreciation right, incentive compensation, and bonus plans, which are adopted after the effective date of the Executive's Agreement and in which the Executive participates immediately prior to the Relevant Date, including but not limited to any substitute plans adopted prior to the Relevant Date (or any successor or additional plan), which had not vested or matured as of the date of termination of employment and will not vest or mature as a result of the termination of the Executive's employment, such payment to be determined as though such award or grant had vested or matured on the date of termination of the Executive's employment;
        
(vi)
Incentive Investment Plan
. A lump sum amount equal to any benefits under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Salaried Employees Incentive Investment Plan (or any successor or additional plan) that the Executive has accrued, but that are forfeited as a result of his or her termination of employment, based upon the value of the Executive's account as of the most recent valuation date before the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment;
        
(vii)
Retirement Contribution Plan
. A lump sum amount equal to the excess of (A) the benefits under the Retirement Contribution Plan to which the Executive would be entitled if the Executive were fully vested in all of his or her benefits under the Retirement Contribution Plan at the date of termination of employment, over (B) the value of the benefits to which the Executive is actually entitled at the date of termination of employment, based upon the value of the Executive's account as of the most recent valuation date before the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment;
       
(viii)
Medical and Dental Benefits
. A lump sum amount equal to (a) the amount of the monthly premiums that the Executive would be required to pay, if he or she elected "COBRA" continuation coverage under the medical and dental plans of the Corporation in which the Executive was participating immediately before the Qualified Termination of Employment, based upon the premium rates in effect as of the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment, times (b) 24.
          
(i)
Severance Pay Plan Payments
. In the event of a Qualified Termination of Employment, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive any
 
 
 
severance benefits that would otherwise be available to the Executive under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Severance Pay Plan (or any successor or additional plan), or any other severance program sponsored by the Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries.
         
(ii)
Participation in Employee Benefit Plans
. The Executive's participation in savings, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, and/or stock appreciation rights plans of the Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries shall continue only through the last day of the Executive's employment. Any terminating distributions and/or vested rights under such plans shall be governed by the terms of those respective plans. Furthermore, the Executive's participation in any insurance plans of the Corporation and rights to any other fringe benefits shall except as otherwise specifically provided in such plans or corporate policy, terminate as of the close of the Executive's last day of employment, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to entitle the Executive to any rights, or to payments under this Agreement, with respect to any employee benefit plan which the Executive was not a participant prior to a Qualified Termination of Employment.
         
(iii)
Continuing Obligations
. The Executive shall retain in confidence any confidential information known to the Executive concerning the Corporation and its business so long as such information is not publicly disclosed.
        
(iv)
No Guarantee of Employment
. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to entitle the Executive to continued employment with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and the rights of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of the Executive shall continue as fully as if this Agreement were not in effect;
provided
that any Qualified Termination of Employment shall entitle the Executive to the benefits herein provided.
          
C.
Definition of Change of Control
. For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have taken place upon the first of the following to occur after the date of this Agreement: (i) a third person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, acquires shares of the Corporation having 20% or more of the total number of votes that may be cast for the
 
 
 
 
 
election of directors of the Corporation; or (ii) as the result of any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets or contested election, or any combination of the foregoing transactions (a "Transaction"), the persons who were directors of the Corporation before the Transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any successor to the Corporation.
          
D.
Definition of Subsidiary
. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Subsidiary" shall mean any domestic or foreign corporation at least twenty percent (20%) of whose shares normally entitled to vote in electing directors is owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation or by other Subsidiaries.
          
E.
Certain Reduction of Payments by the Corporation when Payments Do Not Exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount
.
          
(i)
This Paragraph E shall only be applicable if it shall be determined that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe harbor Amount. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other certified public accounting firm designated by the Corporation (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject the Executive to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Separation Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount." If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Separation Payment shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount. All fees payable to the Accounting Firm with respect to this Paragraph E shall be paid solely by the Corporation.
         
(ii)
If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Separation Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Corporation shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the Executive may then elect, in the Executive's sole discretion, which and how much of the Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the Corporation in writing of the Executive's election within ten days of the Executive's receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the Executive within such ten-day period, the Corporation may elect which of such Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate Separation
 
 
 
Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the Executive promptly of such election. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this paragraph shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive, and shall be made within 60 days of a termination of employment of the Executive. As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive such Separation Payments as are then due to the Executive under this Agreement, and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Executive in the future such Separation Payments as become due to the Executive under this Agreement.
         
(iii)
While it is the intention of the Corporation to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to the Executive hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Executive would thereby be increased as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment"), or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, any such benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Corporation, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code;
provided, however
, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code, or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive together
 
 
 
with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligation with respect to any Overpayment or Underpayment under this Paragraph E shall be conditioned upon the Overpayment or Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
          
F.
Certain Additional Payments by the Corporation when Payments Exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount
.
(i) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth in this paragraph, in the event that it shall be determined that any Payment to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (i) of Paragraph F, if it shall be determined that the Executive would (absent this sentence) be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the provisions of Paragraph E above shall apply to that Executive. The Corporation's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Paragraph F shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
(ii) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F, all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph F, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation. All fees and expenses of
 
 
 
the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Paragraph F, shall be paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive no earlier than the date of payments under Paragraph A of this Agreement, or if later within 5 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive on the later of the date of such determination or after the date payments are due under Paragraph A of this Agreement. The Corporation's obligation with respect to any underpayment under this Paragraph F shall be conditioned upon the Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated.
(iii) The Executive shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim. The Executive shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Corporation desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
 
 
 
 
 
provided, however
, that the Corporation shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (iii) of Paragraph F, the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Corporation shall determine;
provided, however
, that, if the Corporation directs the Executive to pay such claim and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with such payment; and
provided, further
, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
 
 
 
amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Corporation's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(iv) If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, if applicable) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Paragraph F, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Corporation does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority, for the benefit of the Executive, all or any portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and by signing this Agreement, the Executive consents to such withholding.
          
(i)
Annual Bonus Amount
: The Target-level award payable to the Executive for the year in which the Relevant Date occurred (or, if not then established, for the preceding year) or, if higher, for any subsequent year that begins before the Qualified Termination of Employment, under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Executive Officer Achievement Award Program or the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Management Achievement Award Program, as applicable, or any successor or additional plan.
 
 
 
 
 
         
(b)
the Executive's dishonesty, habitual neglect or incompetence in the management of the affairs of the Corporation; or
         
(c)
the refusal or failure by the Executive to act in accordance with any lawful directive or order of the Corporation, or an act or failure to act by the Executive which is in bad faith and which is detrimental to the Corporation.
         
(v)
Committee
: The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
        
(vi)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any previously executed noncompetition agreement shall continue in effect following the execution of this Agreement and the Relevant Date.
