2006 bonus awards under the Plan will be based on the Committee's judgment regarding the Corporation's and the executive officer's performance in 2006 against the objectives. The corporate objectives include both financial and non-financial goals. The financial goals for 2006 include growth in net sales, growth in earnings per share and improvement in return on invested capital. Non-financial goals for 2006 include various qualitative and quantitative measures which are intended to further align compensation with achieving the Company's Global Business Plan. The non-financial goals vary by executive officer depending on their areas of responsibilities. Depending on actual performance in 2006 against the financial and non-financial goals, 2006 bonus awards could range from zero to 240 percent of each executive officer's target bonus. In no event, will any executive officer's actual bonus exceed 0.3% of the Company's 2006 earnings before unusual items.
