2007 cash incentive payments under the Plan will be based on the Committee's judgment regarding the performance of the Corporation and its executive officers in 2007 against the objectives. The corporate objectives include both key financial and other financial and strategic goals. The key financial goals for 2007 include growth in net sales, growth in adjusted earnings per share and improvement in adjusted return on invested capital. Other financial and strategic goals for 2007 include various qualitative and quantitative measures which are intended to further align compensation with achieving the Corporation's Global Business Plan, and include the following: net sales growth in specific businesses; net sales growth in specific markets; net sales targets from new products; brand equity improvement in specific brands; and implementation of certain competitive improvement initiatives and business support delivery initiatives. The other financial and strategic goals vary by executive officer depending on their areas of responsibilities. Depending on actual performance in 2007 against the financial and non-financial goals, 2007 cash incentive payments could range from zero to 240 percent of each executive officer's target incentive payment.
