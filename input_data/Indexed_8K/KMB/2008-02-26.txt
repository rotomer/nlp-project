(e)   On February 21, 2008, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Kimberly-Clark Corporation (the Corporation) established the objectives for 2008 cash incentive payments payable in 2009 to the executive officers of the Corporation under the Corporations Executive Officer Achievement Award Plan (the Plan). The Plan was approved by the Corporations stockholders on April 25, 2002, and filed as Exhibit 10(d) to the Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Depending on actual performance in 2008 against the financial and non-financial objectives, or goals, established by the Committee, 2008 incentive payments could range from zero to 240 percent of each executive officers target payment. The Committee sets the appropriate split among corporate key financial goals, other corporate financial and strategic performance goals, and business unit or function objectives each year.
Incentive payments for 2008 will be based on the Committees judgment regarding our corporate and the executive officers performance in 2008 against those objectives. The key corporate financial goals for 2008 are aligned with our long-term Global Business Plan objectives and include growth in adjusted earnings per share, growth in net sales and improvement in adjusted return on invested capital.
The Committee also established other corporate financial and non-financial goals for 2008.  These goals, intended to further align compensation with achieving our Global Business Plan, include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, goals have been established for each executive officer, other than our Chief Executive Officer, relating to his or her specific function or business unit.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
