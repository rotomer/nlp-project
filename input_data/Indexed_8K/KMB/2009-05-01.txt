At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Kimberly-Clark Corporation (the "Corporation") on April 30, 2009, the stockholders of the Corporation approved an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the Amended Certificate) that, subject to certain procedures described in the Corporations By-Laws (the By-Laws), allows the holders of not less than 25 percent of the Corporations issued and outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote to request that a special meeting of stockholders be called.  The Amended Certificate became effective on April 30, 2009.
 
As previously reported on Form 8-K filed by the Corporation on November 17, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted amendments on November 12, 2008 to the By-Laws that became effective upon stockholder approval of the Amended Certificate.  The amendments to the By-Laws, among other things, (1) describe how the record date is to be set to determine the stockholders entitled to request a special meeting of stockholders, (2) specify information requirements for the request that are similar to those in place for stockholders to bring business or a nominee for director before an annual meeting, (3) describe how a stockholder may revoke a request and (4) specify when a special meeting will not be held.  
 
The foregoing summary of the Amended Certificate and By-Laws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Certificate and By-Laws, copies of which are incorporated herein by reference to Exhibits (3)a and (3)b attached to this Form 8-K.

For purposes of this By-Law 8, written revocation shall mean delivering a notice of revocation to the Secretary or a Public Announcement (as hereinafter defined) that the stockholders who submitted the request for a special meeting hold in the aggregate less than the requisite number of shares of stock entitling the stockholders to request the calling of a special meeting.
A special meeting requested by stockholders shall not be held if (1) the stockholder request to call a special meeting relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (2) the Board has called or calls for a meeting of stockholders and the purpose or purposes of such meeting include (among any other matters properly brought before the meeting) the purpose or purposes specified in the request; (3) the request is received by the corporation during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (4) an identical or substantially similar item was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within 120 days prior to receipt by the corporation of such request; or (5) an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request to call the special meeting was received by the corporation which included the purpose or purposes specified in the request.
The Secretary shall determine in good faith whether the requirements set forth in this By-Law 8 have been satisfied. Any such determination shall be binding on the corporation and its stockholders.
The business conducted at a special meeting shall be limited to the purpose or purposes set forth in the notice of such meeting, provided that the Board may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at a stockholder-called special meeting.  The
 3
 
 
 
Board shall determine the place, date and time of any stockholder-called special meeting.  Special meetings shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and set forth in the notice of meeting. In the event no such place has been fixed, special meetings shall be held at the offices of the corporation located in Dallas County, Texas. In accordance with the provisions of applicable law, the Board acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting of stockholders.
