In exchange for the consideration outlined in Paragraph 2 above, Employee, for the Employee, Employee's attorneys, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, fully, finally and forever releases and discharges K-C, all parent, subsidiary, related and affiliated companies, including Kimberly-Clark Corporation, and its parent, subsidiary, related and affiliated companies, as well as its and their successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees (all of whom are referred to throughout this Agreement as KCC), of and from all claims, demands,
actions, causes of action, suits, damages, losses, and expenses, of any and every nature whatsoever, as a result of actions or omissions occurring through the execution date of this Agreement. Specifically included in this waiver and release are, among other things, any and all claims of alleged employment discrimination, either as a result of the separation of Employee's employment or otherwise, any claims under any KCC severance pay plan, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), the US tax code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), any other federal, state or local statute, rule, ordinance, or regulation, as well as any claims for alleged wrongful discharge, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, fraud, defamation, or any other unlawful behavior, the existence of which is specifically denied by KCC.
Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from filing a charge or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC or comparable state or local agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee waives Employee's right to recover monetary or other damages as a result of any charge or lawsuit filed by Employee or by anyone else on Employee's behalf, including a class or collective action, whether or not Employee is named in such proceeding.

8.
    
NON-ADMISSION OF LIABILITY OR WRONGFUL CONDUCT

7.     
Enforcement
.
(a)     Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective, valid and enforceable under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 or 4 are unenforceable because they are overbroad in some respect, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the court should revise or reform any aspect of Sections 2, 3 or 4 so as to make the scope of such Sections as broad as can be enforced under applicable law.

CONFIDENTIALITY, NONSOLICITATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF BUSINESS IDEAS AGREEMENT - MAY 2005
using during my employment with the Company any confidential information or trade secrets that I acquired from any previous employer.
(b)     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by any successors or assigns of the Company, but is not assignable by me.

This Agreement is not, however, intended to supersede, replace, or alter the terms of the "Noncompetition and Confidentiality Agreement" or "Noncompete Agreement" that I may have executed prior to or contemporaneously with this Agreement.
(d)     Nothing in this Agreement will prevent me, after my employment terminates, from using skills and knowledge of a general and non-confidential nature gained while I was employed at Kimberly-Clark or earlier.
(e)     No waiver, modification or amendment of any term of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing specifying such waiver, modification, or amendment, and signed by an officer of the Company.
(f)     I hereby acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to discuss with a lawyer of my choosing any questions I may have regarding this Agreement, that I fully understand its provisions, and that I have signed it of my own free will in order to enjoy the benefits of employment with Kimberly Clark and the other consideration recited above, and to gain access to the Company Information and Kimberly-Clark's customers. I understand and acknowledge that the Company would not provide me with access to its Company Information or its customers but for my covenants contained in this
Agreement.
(g)
    
FOR EMPLOYEES NOT PARTY TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT: This Agreement does not constitute a guarantee or contract of employment for a specific term. All employment with the Company is terminable at will, by either the employee or the Company, for any reason, at any time.

FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES:
Notice under California Labor Code Section 2870. I have been notified and understand that the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement do not apply to any Work Product that constitutes an invention that fully qualifies under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which states as follows:
(A)     ANY PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT AN EMPLOYEE SHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR HER EMPLOYER SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON HIS OR HER OWN TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE INVENTIONS THAT EITHER: (I) RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION TO THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS, OR ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPLOYER; OR (II) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER.

(a)     Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective, valid and enforceable under applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed to be severed from the Agreement, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of the Agreement, all of which shall remain valid and enforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the covenants contained in Sections 2 or 3 are
unenforceable because they are overbroad in some respect, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the court should revise or reform any aspect of Sections 2 or 3 so as to make the scope of such Sections as broad as can be enforced under applicable law.
(b)     In the event of an anticipated or actual breach by me of Sections 2 or 3, I acknowledge and agree that damages would not be an adequate remedy to compensate Kimberly-Clark for the harm to the business of the Company and, in such event, I agree that Kimberly-Clark shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and to temporary injunctive relief to prevent or terminate such anticipated or actual breach, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit any permanent relief to which Kimberly-Clark may be entitled or the damages otherwise recoverable by Kimberly-Clark in any such event.
(c)     If I violate any aspect of this Agreement, or any duty of loyalty or confidentiality imposed by law, in addition to any damages that I may be required to pay, I understand and agree that I shall be required to reimburse the Company for all its costs incurred to enforce the Agreement, including but not limited to, all attorneys' fees.
6.     
Code of Conduct
I acknowledge that I have received, reviewed and agree to abide by the Company's Code of Conduct.
7.     
Miscellaneous
.
(a)     I am not a party to any agreement with any other company containing a nondisclosure or noncompetition provision or other restriction that relates to the Business, which I have not already disclosed to the Company in writing. I understand that I am prohibited from disclosing or using during my employment with the Company any confidential information that I acquired from any previous employer.
(b)     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by any successors or assigns of Kimberly-Clark, but is not assignable by me.
(c)     This Agreement represents the full and complete agreement of the parties and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements on the same subject matters as addressed in this Agreement, including but not limited to the "Noncompete Agreement." This Agreement is not, however, intended to supersede, replace, or alter the terms of the "Confidentiality, Nonsolicitation and Assignment of Business Ideas Agreement" that I may have executed prior to or contemporaneously with this Agreement.
(d)
    No waiver, modification or amendment of any term of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing specifying such waiver, modification, or amendment and signed by an officer of the Company.
(e)     Nothing in this Agreement will prevent me, after my employment terminates, from using skills and knowledge of a general and non-confidential nature gained while I was employed at Kimberly-Clark or earlier.
(f)
    I hereby acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to discuss with a lawyer of my choosing any questions I may have regarding this Agreement, that I fully understand its provisions, and that I have signed it of my own free will in order to enjoy the benefits of employment with Kimberly Clark and the other consideration recited
