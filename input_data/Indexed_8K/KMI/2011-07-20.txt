Exhibit 99.1
DIVIDEND TO $0.30 PER SHARE
 
HOUSTON, July 20, 2011  Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) today reported second quarter cash available to pay dividends of $154 million.  Through the first two quarters of the year, the company reported cash available to pay dividends of $405 million.
The board of directors increased the dividend for the second quarter to $0.30 per share ($1.20 annualized) from $.29 per share ($1.16 annualized), payable on Aug. 15, 2011, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 1, 2011.
Chairman and CEO Richard D. Kinder said, KMI had a good second quarter and is on target to exceed its previously disclosed annual budget of $820 million in cash available to pay dividends.  We increased the dividend because of solid performance at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, including acquisition and expansion opportunities that are exceeding our budget, which will result in higher distributions to KMI.

CONTACTS
The non-generally accepted accounting principles, or non-GAAP, financial measure of  cash available to pay dividends is presented in this news release.  This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an  alternative to a GAAP measure such as net income or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.  Cash available to pay dividends is a significant metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, research analysts, commercial banks and others, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash dividends we expect to pay our shareholders on an ongoing basis.  Management uses this metric to evaluate our overall performance.  Cash available to pay dividends is also an important non-GAAP financial measure for our shareholders because it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment.  This financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we typically are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in the quarterly dividends we are paying.  Our dividend policy provides that, subject to applicable law, we will pay quarterly cash dividends generally representing the cash we receive from our subsidiaries less any cash disbursements and reserves established by our board of directors.  Cash available to pay dividends is also a quantitative measure used in the investment community because the value of a share of an entity like KMI that pays out all or a substantial proportion of its cash flow, is generally determined by the dividend yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash dividends the corporation pays to its shareholders).  The economic substance behind our use of cash available to pay dividends is to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash flows sufficient to pay dividends to our investors.
We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash available to pay dividends is income from continuing operations.  A reconciliation of cash available to pay dividends to income from continuing operations is provided in this release.  Our non-GAAP measure described above should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income and has important limitations as an analytical tool. Our computation of cash available to pay dividends may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. You should not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  Management compensates for the limitations of this non-GAAP measure by reviewing our comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes.
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although Kinder Morgan believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that such assumptions will materialize.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include those enumerated in Kinder Morgans Forms 10-K and 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and those set forth herein under the caption Other News.
