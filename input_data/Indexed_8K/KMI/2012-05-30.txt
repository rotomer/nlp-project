Effective on May 25, 2012, Kinder Morgan, Inc. ("KMI") completed the acquisition of El Paso Corporation, a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Sirius Holdings Merger Corporation) ("New El Paso"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 16, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among KMI, Sherpa Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of KMI, Sherpa Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of KMI, New El Paso and El Paso LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of New El Paso (f/k/a El Paso Corporation and successor in interest to Sirius Merger Corporation).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sherpa Merger Sub, Inc. was merged with and into New El Paso, with New El Paso surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of KMI (the "Merger"). Immediately following the Merger, New El Paso was merged with and into Sherpa Acquisition, LLC, with Sherpa Acquisition, LLC surviving the merger and being renamed El Paso Holdco LLC. Upon completion of these transactions, El Paso LLC became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of El Paso Holdco LLC, which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of KMI.
Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of New El Paso common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of New El Paso common stock held directly or indirectly by KMI or New El Paso or any of their subsidiaries or dissenting shares in accordance with Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder but subject to proration, one of the following (the "Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.9635 of a share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock and 0.640 of a warrant to purchase one share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock (the "Stock Consideration"); (ii) $25.91 in cash without interest and 0.640 of a warrant to purchase one share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock (the "Cash Consideration"); or (iii) 0.4187 of a share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock, $14.65 in cash without interest and 0.640 of a warrant to purchase one share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock (the "Mixed Consideration"). Outstanding New El Paso equity awards were converted into the right to receive, at the equity award holder's election but subject to proration, either the Cash Election or the Mixed Election.
The final results of the Merger Consideration election (taking into account New El Paso stockholders and equity award holders) are as follows:
 
 
 
 
Because it was oversubscribed, the Stock Consideration underwent a proration adjustment, and holders of New El Paso shares electing the Stock Consideration will receive, on a rounded basis, 0.4231 of a share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock, $14.53 in cash without interest and 0.640 of a warrant to purchase one share of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock for each share of New El Paso common stock.
 
In connection with the Merger, KMI will issue approximately 330.2 million shares of Kinder Morgan Class P common stock and approximately 504.6 million warrants and will pay approximately $11,550.6 million in cash to former New El Paso stockholders and New El Paso equity award holders. The warrants are being issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2012 (the "Warrant Agreement"), among KMI, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Inc., as Warrant Agent.
The foregoing description of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Warrant Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to (i) the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to KMI's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 19, 2011, and (ii) the Warrant Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this report as Exhibit 4.1, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Effective on May 25, 2012, the board of directors of KMI elected Anthony W. Hall, Jr. and Robert F. Vagt, both of whom are former members of the board of directors of New El Paso, to KMI's board, effective as of the effective time of the Merger. Following the elections of Messrs.

Each of Mr. Hall and Mr. Vagt will receive compensation for his service on the board in accordance with KMI's standard compensatory arrangement for non-employee directors. A description of the compensatory arrangement for non-employee directors is set forth in KMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.

In connection with the Merger, KMI's Bylaws were amended and restated as of the effective time of the Merger to (i) increase the size of KMI's board of directors from thirteen to fifteen directors, (ii) amend the definition of Supermajority Board Vote to refer to ten directors instead of eight, and (iii) except from the requirement that specified matters be brought before the KMI board and approved by a Supermajority Board Vote, El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P., a master limited partnership formed in Delaware ("EPB"), and its general partner, El Paso Pipeline GP Company, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company which was acquired by KMI in the Merger ("EPGP"). KMI's original Bylaws provided this exception for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., a master limited partnership formed in Delaware ("KMP"), its general partner, Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "General Partner"), Kinder Morgan Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the delegate of the General Partner ("KMR"), KMP's operating subsidiaries and any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined in the amended and restated Bylaws).

The above summary of the revisions to KMI's Shareholders Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Amendment No. 1 to Shareholders Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this report as Exhibit 4.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 1.5 Exercise of Warrants. (i) In the case of a Holder who holds Warrant Certificates, a Warrant may be exercised by surrender of the Warrant Certificate or Certificates evidencing such Warrant to be exercised and by delivery to the Warrant Agent (or to such other office or agency of the Company in the United States as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the Holders pursuant to Section 4.1) a Notice of Exercise, duly completed and signed, which signature shall be guaranteed by a member of a recognized guarantee medallion program, together with payment of the Exercise Price for the
 
Warrant Shares thereby purchased in accordance with Section 1.6 and (ii) in the case of a Holder who holds Book-Entry Warrants, a Warrant may be exercised by delivery to the Warrant Agent (or to such other office or agency of the Company in the United States as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the Holders pursuant to Section 4.1) a Notice of Exercise, duly completed and signed, which signature shall be guaranteed by a member of a recognized guarantee medallion program, together with payment of the Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares thereby purchased in accordance with Section 1.6. As promptly as practicable after receiving a Notice of Exercise to purchase Warrant Shares, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Company.
SECTION 1.6 Payment of Exercise Price. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for all Warrant Shares purchased may be made, at the option of the Holder, either (a) by certified or official bank check payable to Computershare or (b) by delivering a written direction to the Warrant Agent that the Holder desires to exercise the Warrants pursuant to a "cashless exercise," in which case the Holder will receive a number of Warrant Shares that is equal to the aggregate number of Warrant Shares for which the Warrants are being exercised less the number of Warrant Shares that have an aggregate Market Price on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised that is equal to the aggregate Exercise Price for such Warrant Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, if Warrants are exercised such that the aggregate Exercise Price would exceed the aggregate value (as measured by the Market Price) of the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise, no amount shall be due and payable by the Holder to the Company, and such exercise shall be null and void and no Warrant Shares shall thereupon be issued and the Warrants shall continue in effect.
The Company acknowledges that the bank accounts maintained by Computershare in connection with the services provided under this Agreement will be in its name and that Computershare may receive investment earnings in connection with the investment at Computershare's risk and for its benefit of funds held in those accounts from time to time.

Warrant Registry
SECTION 1.8 Exchange of Warrant Certificates. Subject to Section 1.1, each Warrant Certificate may be exchanged for another Warrant Certificate or Certificates of like tenor and representing the same aggregate number of Warrants. Any Holder desiring to exchange a Warrant Certificate or Certificates shall deliver a written request to the Warrant Agent and shall properly endorse and surrender the Warrant Certificate or Certificates to be so exchanged. Thereupon, the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant Certificate or Certificates, as so requested, in such name or names as such Holder shall designate. Upon the request of any Holder of Book-Entry Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall deliver to the Holder a new Warrant Statement or Statements, as so requested.
SECTION 1.9 Cancellation of Warrant Certificates. If and when any Warrant Certificate has been exercised in full, the Warrant Agent shall promptly cancel such Warrant Certificate following its receipt from the Holder or, to the extent required by applicable law, retain such Warrant Certificate. Upon exercise of a Warrant Certificate in part
 
and not in full, the Warrant Agent shall, subject to Section 1.1, issue and deliver or shall cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Warrant Certificate or Certificates evidencing the Holder's remaining Warrants. If requested by the Company, at the Company's discretion, the Warrant Agent shall deliver to the Company the cancelled Warrant Certificates. The Warrant Agent and no one else may cancel Warrant Certificates surrendered for transfer, exchange, replacement, cancellation or exercise. The Company may not issue new Warrant Certificates to replace cancelled Warrant Certificates that have been exercised or purchased by it. If and when any Book Entry Warrant has been exercised, whether in part or in full, the Warrant Agent shall promptly reflect such exercise on the books and records of the Warrant Agent in book-entry form and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder a new Warrant Statement or Warrant Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, upon any exercise of Warrants, whether by a Holder of Book-Entry Warrants or by a Holder of Warrant Certificates, the Warrant Registry shall be updated to reflect such exercise in accordance with Section 1.7.
SECTION 1.10 No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional Warrant Shares or scrip representing fractional Warrant Shares shall be issued upon any exercise of Warrants. In lieu of any fractional Warrant Shares that would otherwise be issued to a Holder upon exercise of any Warrants, such Holder shall receive a cash payment equal to the Market Price of the Common Stock on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised representing such fractional Warrant Share.
SECTION 1.11 Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Warrants. If any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver, in exchange and substitution for, and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Warrant Agent of the loss, theft or destruction of such Warrant Certificate and an affidavit and the posting of an open penalty bond satisfactory to it. Applicants for such substitute Warrant Certificates shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the Warrant Agent may prescribe and as required by Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Delaware.
SECTION 1.12 Transferability and Assignment. At the option of the Holder thereof, the Warrants and all rights attached thereto may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, by the Registered Holder or by duly authorized attorney, and one or more new Warrant Certificates or Warrant Statements, as applicable, shall be made and delivered and registered in the name of one or more transferees, upon surrender in accordance with Section 1.5 and upon compliance with all applicable laws and subject to the Holder's presenting due evidence of authority to transfer which shall include a signature guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution participating in a signature guarantee program approved by the Securities Transfer Association, and any other reasonable evidence of authority that may be required by the Warrant Agent.
 
SECTION 1.13 Issuance of Warrant Certificates or Warrant Statements. When any Holder, transferee of a Holder or other designee of a Holder is entitled to receive a new or replacement Warrant Certificate or Warrant Statement, as applicable, whether pursuant to Section 1.8, 1.9, 1.11 or 1.12, the Warrant Agent shall issue or shall cause to be issued such new or replacement Warrant Certificate or Warrant Statement, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable.
SECTION 1.14 Issuance of Warrant Shares. Upon the exercise of any Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall deliver or shall cause to be delivered the number of full Warrant Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled, together with any cash to which such Holder shall be entitled in respect of fractional Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 1.10, as promptly as reasonably practicable. All Warrant Shares shall be issued in such name or names as the exercising Holder may designate and delivered to the exercising Holder or its nominee or nominees.
SECTION 1.15 Charges, Taxes and Expenses. The Company shall pay all documentary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any Warrants or certificates (if any) for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Warrants.
SECTION 1.16 Issued Warrant Shares. The Company hereby represents and warrants that all Warrant Shares issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges (other than liens or charges created by a Holder, income and franchise taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of the Warrant or taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously therewith). The Company agrees that the Warrant Shares so issued will be deemed to have been issued to a Holder as of the close of business on the date on which the Warrants were duly exercised, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company may then be closed or certificates (if any) representing such Warrant Shares may not be actually delivered on such date.
SECTION 1.17 Reservation of Sufficient Warrant Shares. There have been reserved, and the Company shall at all times through the Expiration Date keep reserved, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of the issuance of Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to provide for the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the outstanding Warrants. The transfer agent for the Common Stock and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid shall be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. If applicable, the Company shall supply such transfer agents with duly executed stock certificates for such purposes and shall provide or otherwise make available any cash that may be payable upon exercise of Warrants in respect of fractional Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 1.10. The Company shall furnish such transfer agent with a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto, transmitted to each Holder pursuant to Section 4.1.
 
SECTION 1.18 Registration and Listing. The Company shall register or shall cause to be registered any and all shares of its Common Stock (including the Warrant Shares) and all the Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the ""), and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such registration of such shares of its Common Stock (including the Warrant Shares) and all the Warrants. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) procure, or cause to be procured, at its sole expense, the listing of the Warrant Shares and the Warrants, subject to issuance or notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange or, if prior to the closing of the Merger the New York Stock Exchange will not approve the listing of the Warrants on the New York Stock Exchange, then on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange or, if prior to the closing of the Merger the NASDAQ Stock Exchange will not approve the listing of the Warrants on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, another stock exchange reasonably agreed by the Company and El Paso, and (b) maintain such listings at all times until the Expiration Date. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Warrant Shares and the Warrants may be issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation or of any requirement of any securities exchange on which such shares of its Common Stock (including the Warrant Shares) and the Warrants are listed or traded.

SECTION 1.21 Purchase of Warrants by the Company; Cancellation. The Company shall have the right, except as limited by law, other agreements or as provided herein, to purchase or otherwise acquire Warrants at such times, in such manner and for such consideration as it and the applicable Holder may deem appropriate. In the event the Company shall purchase or otherwise acquire Warrants, the same shall thereupon be delivered to the Warrant Agent and retired and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the approval of Holders is required to take any action, the Company's (or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates') ownership in any Warrants shall not be considered in calculating whether the requisite number of Warrants have approved such action.
SECTION 1.22 No Rights as Stockholders. A Warrant shall not, prior to its exercise, confer upon its Holder or such Holder's transferee, in such Holder's or such transferee's capacity as a Warrant Holder, the right to vote or receive dividends, or consent or receive notice as stockholders in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors of the Company or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company.
 
SECTION 2.1 Adjustments and Other Rights. The Exercise Price and the Exercise Number shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided by this Article II; , , that if more than one section of this Article II is applicable to a single event, the section shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment, and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one section of this Article II so as to result in duplication.

SECTION 2.2 Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Reclassifications or Combinations. If the Company shall (a) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (b) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (c) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Number at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Number effective immediately prior to such event by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after such event and (y) the denominator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such event. In such event, the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Number immediately prior to such adjustment and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the new Exercise Number determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
SECTION 2.3 Other Distributions. If the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding Ordinary Cash Dividends, dividends of its Common Stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in Section 2.2), in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately upon occurrence of the record date to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (such subtracted amount and/or Fair Market Value, the "") divided by (y) such Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the Exercise Number shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Exercise Number immediately prior
Per Share Fair Market Value
 
to such adjustment by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the Per Share Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend.
SECTION 2.4 Certain Repurchases of Common StockIf the Company effects a Pro Rata Repurchase of Common Stock, then the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of such Pro Rata Repurchase by a fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Pro Rata Repurchase and (y) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (ii) the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, and of which (b) the denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the Market Price per share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the Exercise Number shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Exercise Number immediately prior to such adjustment by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, no increase to the Exercise Price or decrease in the Exercise Number shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.4.
.
SECTION 2.5 Business Combinations or Reclassifications of Common Stock. In case of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 2.2), a Holder's right to receive shares upon exercise of a Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise such Warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to such Holder's right to exercise a Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this section. In determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of a Warrant following the consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of all holders of the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). For purposes of determining any amount to be withheld in the case of a "cashless exercise" pursuant to Section 1.6 from stock,
 
securities or the property that would otherwise be delivered to a Holder upon exercise of Warrants following any Business Combination, the amount of such stock, securities or property to be withheld shall have a Market Price equal to the aggregate Exercise Price as to which such Warrants are so exercised, based on the fair market value of such stock, securities or property on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised and the Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Warrant Agent; , , that in the case of any property that is not a security, the Market Price of such property shall be deemed to be its fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors in reliance on an opinion of a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose; , , that if making such determination requires the conversion of any currency other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars, such conversion shall be done in accordance with customary procedures based on the rate for conversion of such currency into U.S. dollars displayed on the relevant page by Bloomberg L.P. (or any successor or replacement service) on or by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such exercise date.

(b) In the event that any dividend or distribution described in this Article II is not so made, the Exercise Price and the Exercise Number then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price and the Exercise Number that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
SECTION 2.9 Statement Regarding Adjustments. Whenever the Exercise Price or the Exercise Number shall be adjusted as provided in this Article II, the Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the Exercise Number after such adjustment. The Company shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a copy of such statement and shall cause a copy of such statement to be sent or communicated to the Holders pursuant to Section 4.1.

As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this Article II, the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market or other applicable national securities exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all Warrant Shares that a Holder is entitled to receive upon exercise of a Warrant pursuant to this Article II.
SECTION 2.12 Adjustment Rules. Any adjustments pursuant to this Article II shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.

Exhibit 99.1
 
HOUSTON, May 24, 2012  Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EP), which was announced in October of 2011. Combining the two companies makes Kinder Morgan the largest midstream and the fourth largest energy company (based on combined enterprise value) in North America. Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction will be effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on May 25, 2012.
"We are delighted to close the El Paso transaction and we are very excited about the natural gas footprint that we now have in the United States with the addition of approximately 44,000 miles of natural gas pipelines from El Paso," Richard D. Kinder, chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan stated. "We are bullish on the future of natural gas and believe that it will be the fuel of choice in America for many years to come. It's domestically abundant, clean and cheap. As the largest transporter and storage operator of natural gas in the United States, we have many growth opportunities across the country, and we are eager to get to work to leverage these assets for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and our employees."
Sale of Exploration and Production Assets Completed
The approximately $7.15 billion sale of El Paso's exploration and production business (EP Energy) to affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC and others, which was announced in late February, has also closed. As previously announced, El Paso's net operating loss carryforwards will largely offset taxes associated with the sale of the exploration and production business, and thus almost the entire proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce substantially the debt incurred by KMI to fund the cash portion of its purchase of El Paso.
 
 
Integration and Growth Expectations
"I'm very pleased with the herculean effort that has occurred over the past several months to combine Kinder Morgan and El Paso," Kinder said. "The integration planning effort was managed and fully staffed by personnel from the two organizations, ensuring that the people who understand best how to operate these assets are establishing how they will be managed moving forward. This has required a tremendous amount of work by a large number of people who are still responsible for their normal jobs. The value of their contributions will be realized by the combined organization for many years to come."
The El Paso acquisition is expected to be nicely accretive to KMI. The company now anticipates cost savings in excess of $400 million per year, significantly higher than the previously announced projection of approximately $350 million per year. These cost savings will benefit KMI, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EPB). KMI previously announced that, excluding the impact of the El Paso transaction, it expected to declare dividends of $1.35 per share for 2012. Now, incorporating the impact of the El Paso transaction, KMI expects to declare dividends of at least $1.40 per share for 2012. KMI also intends to recommend to its board of directors a dividend of $0.35 per share for the second quarter of 2012. KMP (and KMR) expects to meet or exceed its previously announced budget to declare distributions of $4.98 per unit (per share for KMR) for 2012.
Dropdowns and KMP Transactions
El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EPB) has completed its purchase of the remaining 14 percent interest in Colorado Interstate Gas and all of Cheyenne Plains Pipeline from El Paso for $635 million and the assumption of approximately $242 million of proportional debt. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to EPB's distributable cash flow.
As previously announced, KMI agreed to divest certain KMP assets to obtain Federal Trade Commission approval for the El Paso transaction. KMI has agreed to sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Company, its Casper-Douglas natural gas processing and West Frenchie Draw treating facilities in Wyoming, and the company's 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. The company has six months from the commission's May 1, 2012, order to sell the assets.
Also as previously announced, KMI plans to offer assets to KMP to replace the divested assets. The company expects to drop down all of Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a portion of El Paso Natural Gas contemporaneously with the close of KMP's divestitures, which are expected to occur in the third quarter this year. It is expected that the combination of the divestitures and the dropdowns will be neutral to KMP's distribution per unit in 2012 and accretive thereafter.
 
 
In April, KMP announced an agreement with an investment vehicle affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., whereby KMP will acquire a 50 percent interest in the joint venture that owns the Altamont gathering, processing and treating assets in the Uinta Basin in Utah and the Camino Real gathering system in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas for $300 million in KMP common units. El Paso owns the other 50 percent of the joint venture. Upon closing, Kinder Morgan will own 100 percent of the joint venture, 50 percent at KMI and 50 percent at KMP. The transaction is expected to close in early June and to be immediately accretive to KMP's distributable cash flow.
Board of Directors
KMI announced today that Anthony W. Hall, Jr., and Robert F. Vagt have been named to the KMI board of directors. As previously announced, two members of El Paso's board were to join the KMI board following completion of the transaction. Hall served as a director at El Paso since 2001 and was a member of the Audit Committee and the Health, Safety & Environmental Committee. Hall has been engaged in the private practice of law since 2010 and previously served as chief administrative officer of the City of Houston. Vagt served as a director at El Paso since 2005 and chaired the Health, Safety & Environmental Committee and was a member of the Compensation Committee. He has served as president of The Heinz Endowments since 2008.
The EPB board of directors will be comprised of the same three outside directors who were serving prior to the Kinder Morgan-El Paso transaction, along with four Kinder Morgan officers who will replace the El Paso officers who had been on the board. Richard D. Kinder will serve as Chairman of the EPB board. Additionally, existing Kinder Morgan senior officers will serve in their same roles as officers of all of the publicly traded Kinder Morgan entities, including EPB.
