Certain stockholders (the Selling Stockholders) of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI) are commencing an underwritten public offering (the "Offering") of 58,000,000 shares of Class P common stock par value $0.01 per share of the Corporation (the "Shares") pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179812).  The Selling Stockholders intend to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 8,700,000 additional shares. Neither KMI nor KMIs management is selling any shares of common stock in the offering, and KMI will not receive any of the proceeds from the offering of shares by the Selling Stockholders.
